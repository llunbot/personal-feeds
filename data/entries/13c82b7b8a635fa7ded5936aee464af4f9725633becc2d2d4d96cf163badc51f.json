In theory we (developers) could do this today, but I\nwould love to see a blessed system where Apple provided APIs to\nother LLM providers.</p>\n\n<p>Are there security concerns? Yes, of course there are, there\nalways will be. But I would like the choice.</p>\n\n<p>The crux of the issue in my mind is this: Apple has a lot of good\nideas, but they don’t have a monopoly on them. I would like some\nother folks to come in and try their ideas out. I would like\nthings to advance at the pace of the industry, and not Apple’s.\nMaybe with a blessed system in place, Apple could watch and see\nhow people use LLMs and other generative models (instead of giving\nus Genmoji that look like something Fisher-Price would make). And\nmaybe open up the existing Apple-only models to developers. There\nare locally installed image processing models that I would love to\ntake advantage of in my apps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The analogy I used, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/10/yours-truly-guesting-on-upgrade-with-jason-snell\">talking with Jason Snell during my guest stint on Upgrade last week</a>, was to the heyday of desktop publishing. The Mac was <em>the</em> platform for graphic design because it was the best platform for using design apps. Fonts worked better and looked better on the Mac. Printing worked better from Macs. Peripherals worked better. The apps themselves looked better on the Mac than they did on Windows. The Mac had taste and designers (hopefully) have taste. Graphic designers could understand how their machines worked, and maintain them themselves, in a way they couldn’t with PCs. </p>\n\n<p>But Apple didn’t make any of the actual apps. Companies like Adobe and Macromedia and Aldus did. Independent small developers made niche extensions for use inside apps like Photoshop, FreeHand, and QuarkXPress. When a new app came along like InDesign — which quickly ate Quark’s lunch — the Mac remained the dominant platform to use.</p>\n\n<p>Making a great platform where <em>other developers</em> can innovate is one of Apple’s core strengths. Apple got even <em>better</em> at it once Mac OS X hit its stride in the 2000s — the Cocoa APIs really did empower outside developers to make world-class apps providing experiences that couldn’t be matched on other platforms like Windows or Linux. Then it happened again, with a much bigger audience, with iOS. What desktop publishing was to the Mac in the 1990s, social media was to the iPhone in the 2010s. Apple didn’t make the apps — they made the best platform to use those apps.</p>\n\n<p>Apple should be laser focused on doing this for AI now. Where I quibble with Mueller is that I don’t want Apple to get out of the way. I want Apple to pave the roads to create the way. Apple doesn’t have to make the cars (<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/02/27/1234315814/apple-cancels-electric-car\">literally</a>) — just pave the best roads. Make the Mac <em>the</em> best platform for outside developers to create innovative AI systems and experiences. Make iOS <em>the</em> best consumer device to use AI apps from any outside developer. Work on APIs and frameworks for the AI age. No company has ever been better than Apple at designing and delivering those sort of APIs. Lean into that. It’s as useful, relevant, and profitable an institutional strength (and set of values) today as ever.</p>\n\n<p>In a follow-up post, <a href=\"https://shapeof.com/archives/2025/3/how_apple_could_help_developers_with_ai_and_llms.html\">Mueller shows he’s thinking like I’m thinking</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But off the top of my head, here’s one idea that I think could\nreally help and reap benefits for both Apple and developers.</p>\n\n<p>Build a semantic index (SI), and allow apps to access it via\npermissions given similar to what we do for Address Book or\nPhotos.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe even make the permissions to the SI a bit more fine-grained\nthan you normally would for other personal databases. Historical\nGPS locations? Scraping contents of the screen over time? Indexed\ncontents of document folder(s)? Make these options for what goes\ninto the SI.</p>\n\n<p>And of course, the same would be true for building the SI. As a\nuser, I’d love to be able to say “sure, capture what’s on the\nscreen and scrape the text out of that, but nope - you better not\ntrack where I’ve been over time”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>HealthKit already works a lot like what Mueller is suggesting here (for, say, “SemanticKit”). With explicit user permission — that can be revoked at any time — third party apps can both read from and write to your Health data. Apple does a lot of that itself, both through Apple Watch and from the various activity-related things an iPhone can track, but third-party apps and devices are welcome participants, in a private, easily-understood way.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/apple-needs-to-get-out-of-the-way-with-ai\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"13c82b7b8a635fa7ded5936aee464af4f9725633becc2d2d4d96cf163badc51f","category":"Tech"}
