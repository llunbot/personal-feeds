He also demonstrated how the technology could precisely manipulate apps via voice control. It embedded content in an email, added recipients and made other changes.</blockquote>The above paragraph in the report was <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/14/all-hands-siri-team-meeting-leaks-to-bloomberg\">highlighted by <em>Daring Fireball</em>'s John Gruber</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile it may sound obvious that at least some of the features now exist within Apple, this was not entirely clear, as the company has not shown any public demos of the features being in a working state. Apple now faces the task of ensuring that the features not only work, but work well, before making them available to customers. Walker reportedly said the features were only working \"up to two-thirds to 80% of the time.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple said it anticipates rolling out the personalized Siri features \"in the coming year,\" but it did not provide a more specific timeframe.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhenever they launch, the Siri upgrades will include understanding of a user's personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls. For example, during its WWDC 2024 keynote, Apple showed an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans based on info from the Mail and Messages apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/apple-website-siri-features-fine-print/\">added fine print to its iPhone 16 product pages</a> that says the features are \"in development\":<blockquote>Siri's personal context understanding, onscreen awareness, and in-app actions are in development and will be available with a future software update.</blockquote>Gurman said the features currently \"aren't expected until next year at the earliest,\" and recent reports from <em>Reuters</em> and <em>CNBC</em> have also mentioned a 2026 timeframe. If so, that means the Siri upgrades are unlikely to launch until iOS 19.4 or later.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/15/personalized-siri-features-working-to-some-extent/\">Apple's Delayed Personalized Siri Features Are 'Working' to Some Extent</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-delayed-personalized-siri-features-are-working-to-some-extent.2453189/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bd194b29ab1851ede17490629554651dda6ee4cdc7646f2a9a37465418f22f6b","category":"Apple"}
