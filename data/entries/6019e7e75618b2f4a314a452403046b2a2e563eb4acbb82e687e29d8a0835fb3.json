The MagTag works just like an AirTag, but it’s about the size of a credit card, so you can slide it into your wallet, behind your ID badge at work, or a ton of other places an AirTag just won’t fit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pull up a map and find exactly where your wallet is. If it’s nearby, you can even make your tracker card play a sound. Or activate Lost Mode to display your contact info to anyone who finds your lost items. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You still get the benefit of tracking your items with the Apple Find My app, and this tracker is even IP68 waterproof, so it can stand up to rain, dust, and a whole lot more. Don’t worry about recharging. This little tracker can even last up to five months on a full battery. Just toss it on any Qi wireless charger when you need to refill the battery. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have until March 30 at 11:59 p.m. PT to get a <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/magtag-ultra-slim-tracker-card-with-apple-find-my?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=magtag-ultra-slim-tracker-card-with-apple-find-my&amp;utm_term=scsf-614695&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003JeUfIAK&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">MagTag Ultra Slim Tracker Card</a> on sale for $23.97. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/magtag-ultra-slim-tracker-card-with-apple-find-my?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=magtag-ultra-slim-tracker-card-with-apple-find-my&amp;utm_term=scsf-614695&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003JeUfIAK&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp2.stackassets.com/d4ae964c5f6c24fd2884d377c9419a7db1ab3937/store/bba54c79cfcc980df622114edb3c9b8149e0525bce8c9f709c99fd8d0668/sale_327501_primary_image.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MagTag Ultra Slim Tracker Card – Works with Apple Find My App – $23.97</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/magtag-ultra-slim-tracker-card-with-apple-find-my?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=magtag-ultra-slim-tracker-card-with-apple-find-my&amp;utm_term=scsf-614695&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003JeUfIAK&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com\" target=\"_blank\">StackSocial</a> prices subject to change. </em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6019e7e75618b2f4a314a452403046b2a2e563eb4acbb82e687e29d8a0835fb3","category":"Apple"}
