Sure enough, he and a researcher working with him online, Shubham Shah, soon discovered vulnerabilities in a Subaru web portal that let them hijack the ability to unlock the car, honk its horn, and start its ignition, reassigning control of those features to any phone or computer they chose.</p>\n<p>Most disturbing for Curry, though, was that they found they could also track the Subaru's location—not merely where it was at the moment but also where it had been for the entire year that his mother had owned it. The map of the car’s whereabouts was so accurate and detailed, Curry says, that he was able to see her doctor visits, the homes of the friends she visited, even which exact parking space his mother parked in every time she went to church.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/millions-of-subarus-could-be-remotely-unlocked-tracked-due-to-security-flaws/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/millions-of-subarus-could-be-remotely-unlocked-tracked-due-to-security-flaws/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andy Greenberg, wired.com","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8d348abc609988f0e0435469abb764f685b4ec8a6c6434558612ec4bdbf22503","category":"Tech"}
