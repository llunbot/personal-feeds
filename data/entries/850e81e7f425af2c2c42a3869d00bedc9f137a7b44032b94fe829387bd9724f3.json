But did you know that a student Apple Music subscription comes with Apple TV+ for free! </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apple Music usually costs $10.99/£10.99, but students can get it for $5.99/£5.99 a month (for up to four years as long as you remain a student). </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple TV+ usually costs $8.99/£8.99 a month, but students who subscribe to Apple Music get it free. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can students get Apple Music or Apple TV for free?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you subscribe you might like to take advantage of the free trials on offer, especially if you have recently purchased a new Apple product as you may qualify for a longer trial. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Music: </strong>Anyone who hasn’t previously had a trial can get an Apple Music trial before their subscription starts. As standard, there is a one-month trial, but we often see two or three-month offers. However, you can get up to six months free if you have recently bought an eligible audio device.
