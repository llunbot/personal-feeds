Content such as your emails from the Mail app and messages from the Messages app will be displayed to you, along with content generated from them for Apple Intelligence features. This data always remains on your device unless you choose to submit it to Apple, after rating your experience.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the new section, users are asked to \"thumbs up\" or \"thumbs down\" recent generated content to indicate their level of satisfaction with the results. If the \"experience\" shown was not good, users are invited to optionally offer more details for submission to Apple. This can be done by choosing from pre-defined feedback presented as a checkmark list, and by providing additional typed information for context.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the case of a summarized email in the Mail app, for example, users can choose from the following issues:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n  <li>Hard to understand</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Missed key detail</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Incorrect attributions</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Too long</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Irrelevant additions</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Stereotyping or bias</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Overly suggestive or sexual</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Vulgar or offensive</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Other</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nThere are similar pre-set feedback options for other Apple Intelligence features such as Smart reply, Notifications summary, prioritized emails, Image Playground, Writing Tools, and more. The new section also includes a scoring system that lets users level up their score by providing feedback to Apple, although it's not explained what any points earned could be used for. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple introduced the first version of Apple Intelligence in the iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 developer betas.
