Boston Dynamics has a <a href=\"https://bostondynamics.com/blog/electric-new-era-for-atlas/\">new humanoid robot</a> that the company says represents a path to commercialization. It's the company's next-generation, all-electric \"Atlas\" robot.</p>\n<p>While new Atlas and old Atlas share a name, they couldn't be more different when it comes to construction. The old Atlas—a research platform and viral sensation that could handle nearly any terrain, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/boston-dynamics-shares-an-incredible-behind-the-scenes-look-at-robot-building/\">do backflips</a>, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/boston-dynamics-atlas-tries-out-inventory-work-gets-better-at-lifting/\">pick up heavy objects</a>—was powered by a heavy, complicated hydraulics system. The new Atlas is all-electric and looks like it's a fraction of the size and weight of the hydraulic version. It also looks like <em>a product</em>, with covers around all the major components and consumer-friendly design touches like a giant status light in the head and a light-up power button that looks like it was ripped right from the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/boston-dynamics-robot-dog-gets-an-arm-attachment-self-charging-capabilities/\">Spot</a> assembly line.</p>\n<p>Hydraulic Atlas is being retired to make way for the all-electric version. The company posted one last <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9EM5_VFlt8\">goodbye video</a> for the hydraulic model on its YouTube page, showing the history of the project. Atlas has done a lot of neat tricks over the years, but getting there has required a lot of learning—part of that is taking some absolutely gnarly slams, which are highlighted in the video. The video seemed to go out of its way to show just how cumbersome hydraulics can be. At one point, it looks like Atlas' foot <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-9EM5_VFlt8?t=85\">completely breaks off</a>, and hydraulic fluid gushes all over the floor. Other times, the robot just springs a leak, and a fine mist of high-pressure fluid sprays everywhere as the robot goes limp. The fluid has a red tinge to it, so with a little imagination, it can look pretty gory!</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017478#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017478&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"81493d519db93d17d936fd23885ea28c78e536223da988c8bac65f4ccdff55c1","category":"Tech"}
