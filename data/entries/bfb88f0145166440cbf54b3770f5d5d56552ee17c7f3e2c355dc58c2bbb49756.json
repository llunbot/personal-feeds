It’s just 149g, but it stays heavy on performance and comfort features, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a three-zone construction, they print the cushioning with more or less support to cushion where it’s needed based on how and where you’re sitting on it:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Prologo-Pressure-Map-MyOwn.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1279\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Prologo-Pressure-Map-MyOwn.jpg\" alt=\"pressure mapping chart of prologo nago r4 3dmss lightweight road saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Prologo-Pressure-Map-MyOwn.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Prologo-Pressure-Map-MyOwn-297x190.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Prologo-Pressure-Map-MyOwn-800x512.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Prologo-Pressure-Map-MyOwn-120x77.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Prologo-Pressure-Map-MyOwn-768x491.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Prologo-Pressure-Map-MyOwn-1536x982.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting with they MyOwn pressure mapping research and experience with the standard Nago saddles, they identified three distinct zones. This “Multi Sector System” design is already used on many of their other saddles, including the excellent XC race saddle I included in my <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/editors-choice-tylers-top-picks-from-2023/\">Editor’s Choice list for 2023</a>.
