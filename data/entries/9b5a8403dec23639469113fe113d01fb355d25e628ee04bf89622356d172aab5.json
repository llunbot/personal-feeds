An ICP filing is the state registration system required for websites to operate legally in China. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo get the license, developers must have a company in China or work with a local publisher, a requirement that has stymied take-up by a large number of foreign apps. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nMost local app stores including those operated by Tencent and Huawei have adopted the filing since at least 2017, so Apple is simply falling in line with a recently updated policy that is already established in China's software publishing industry.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nChina already blocks the websites of many popular western social media apps like Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube, but iPhone users in China have been able to download their apps from Apple's ‌App Store‌ by using unauthorized VPN services that connect them to an internet server outside the country. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnder new rules issued in July by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Apple will no longer be able to offer such apps in its China ‌App Store‌ from next July unless the app operators are registered with the government.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nChinese officials last week reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/29/apple-china-discuss-rules-banning-western-apps/\">told</a> Apple staff that the company must strictly implement the rules banning unregistered foreign apps, thereby closing the loophole allowing Chinese ‌iPhone‌ users to download them. Apple was said to have been told that the new rules are needed to crack down on online scams, pornography, and the circulation of information that violates China's censorship rules.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMost foreign app operators are unlikely to register with the Chinese government, because doing so would force them to comply with data transfer and censorship requirements. This will leave Apple with no choice but to remove them or face legal sanctions.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-adopts-tighter-china-app-store-rules/\">Apple Adopts Tighter Chinese App Store Rules, Closing Foreign App Loophole</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-adopts-tighter-chinese-app-store-rules-closing-foreign-app-loophole.2406085/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9b5a8403dec23639469113fe113d01fb355d25e628ee04bf89622356d172aab5","category":"Apple"}
