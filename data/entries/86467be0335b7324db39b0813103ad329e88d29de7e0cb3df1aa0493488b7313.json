The complete edition will also launch on PlayStation 5, but a bit earlier, on October 6 of this year.</p>\n<p>The PC port will be handled by Nixxes, which previously did a mostly bang-up job porting Sony studio Insomniac Games' <em>Spider-Man</em> and <em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em> to PC. Sony hasn't announced any details about PC-specific features for the game, but some recent ports of first-party PlayStation games have included features like ultrawide monitor support, DLSS AI upscaling, and more. The <em>Spider-Man</em> games prominently featured ray tracing, but ray tracing was part of the PS5 feature set for those games already. <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> does not have ray tracing on PS5, so its inclusion in the PC version is less certain.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971570#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971570&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"86467be0335b7324db39b0813103ad329e88d29de7e0cb3df1aa0493488b7313","category":"Tech"}
