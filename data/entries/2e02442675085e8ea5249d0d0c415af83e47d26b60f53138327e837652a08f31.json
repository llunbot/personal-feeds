Separately, software research on self-driving continued.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe talks with automakers apparently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/05/apple-pauses-car-talks-hyundai-kia/\">fell apart</a> due to repeated delays and the wider industry transformation toward electric vehicles slowing down the progress of any joint development and production agreement. There was also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/29/hyundai-divided-apple-car-partnership/\">reluctance from some large automakers</a> about becoming a manufacturing subcontractor for Apple. Apple is believed to have decided that it could not delay the launch of its car any further.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith these talks stalling, Apple has entirely turned once again to its own development and restored the full operation of its vehicle research unit. Although Doug Field, Apple's vice president of special projects, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/07/apple-car-doug-field-joins-ford/\">recently left the project</a> to join Ford, the company is still believed to have hundreds of engineers working on the vehicle.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has now gone through the process of sending a Request for Information (RFI), Request for Proposal (RFP), and Request for Quotation (RFQ) to global automobile part manufacturers, which is understood to be a signal that the final parts suppliers for Apple's car are now being selected for outsourced production.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMirroring the analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, the report places the launch of the vehicle <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/27/kuo-apple-car-2025-2027-at-earliest/\">around 2025 to 2027</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/09/apple-chose-to-develop-apple-car-alone/\">Report: Apple Chose to Develop Apple Car Alone to Avoid Further Delays, Currently Selecting Suppliers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apple-chose-to-develop-apple-car-alone-to-avoid-further-delays-currently-selecting-suppliers.2310164/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fNEWkdK7w94:Cgw-qjOIL6k:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fNEWkdK7w94:Cgw-qjOIL6k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/fNEWkdK7w94\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2e02442675085e8ea5249d0d0c415af83e47d26b60f53138327e837652a08f31","category":"Apple"}
