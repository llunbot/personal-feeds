According to a new rumor, the headset will have an expansive display that puts a crystal-clear 4K screen in front of each eye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ross Young, CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants and a reliable source of information regarding display tech, claims to have received the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1663595816521699331&amp;xcust=1-1-1935837-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">final display specs</a> for the AR/VR headset that is reportedly launching next week:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Micro OLED</li><li>1.41 inches (measured diagonally)</li><li>4,000ppi</li><li>More than 5,000 nits of brightness</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Presumably, the headset’s display will also support ProMotion with a 120Hz or higher refresh rate. To put it mildly, those are absurd specs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For reference, the PlayStation VR2 headset has a pair of 2000×2040 displays with a ppi of around 850. The latest HoloLens had a max brightness of 500 nits. Also, none of the current devices on the market use Micro OLED—which has superior brightness and black levels than mini LED. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering this is just one aspect of the headset and is a very high-end part, the reports of a $3,000 price tag are likely accurate. Apple is clearly sparing no expense with the first generation of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-reality-headset-ar-vr-design-features-specs-price.html\">Reality Pro headset</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to launch the headset during its <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC keynote</a> on Monday, June 5. You can <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673537/how-to-watch-apple-wwdc-keynote.html\">watch it live</a> at 10amPT/1pm ET.</p>\n\nApple</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2b3f174e84aea4a63cf911fe9b90f83221c1f8892386afa075ced9a7de083613","category":"Apple"}
