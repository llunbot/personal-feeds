If it looks a little strange to you, it's because it uses the Compression Attached Memory Module (CAMM) standardâ€”rather than being a standard stick of RAM that you insert into a slot on your motherboard, it lies flat against the board where metal contacts on the board and the CAMM module can make contact with one another.</p>\n\n<p>CAMM memory has been on my radar for a while, since it first cropped up in a handful of Dell laptops. <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/dells-proprietary-ddr5-module-locks-out-user-upgrades\">Mistakenly identified at the time</a> as a proprietary type of RAM that would give Dell an excuse to charge more for it, Dell has been pushing for the standardization of CAMM modules for a couple of years now, and JEDEC (the organization that handles all current computer memory standards) <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/camm-standard-published-opening-door-for-thin-speedy-ram-to-overtake-so-dimm/\">formally finalized the spec last month</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995134#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995134&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d98cb1ab81cf5f506cf5160ad73b811c11ba6f0ef162a4f6c424eab50529afbd","category":"Tech"}
