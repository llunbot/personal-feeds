The outbreak was caused by clade II mpox viruses, which, between the two mpox clades that exist, is the relatively mild one, causing far fewer deaths. As awareness, precautions, and vaccination increased, the outbreak subsided and was <a href=\"https://www.who.int/europe/emergencies/situations/monkeypox\">declared over in May 2023</a>.</p>\n<p>Unlike the 2022â€“2023 outbreak, the current mpox outbreak is driven by the clade I virus, the more dangerous version that causes more severe disease and more deaths. Also, while the clade II virus in the previous outbreak unexpectedly spread via sexual contact in adults, this clade I outbreak is spreading in more classic contact patterns, mostly through skin contact of household members and health care workers. A large proportion of those infected have been children.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043391#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043391&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7c4c528d541cf0798389c47202fde695bde2609e372a133a19f10dd0fc6fc683","category":"Tech"}
