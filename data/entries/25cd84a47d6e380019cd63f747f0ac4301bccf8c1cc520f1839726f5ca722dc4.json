It’s about changing your mindset. Yes, my body is changing, but I can do things to ameliorate that. And if I can keep cycling as<br />\nI age, it will be so good for my health.”</p>\n<p>So, embrace the ageing process and see it as a chance to learn more about your body so you can make small changes that will benefit your health for years to come. Here, Cavell and Roberts share their timely tips for pedalling through the ages.</p>\n<h2>The 40s: how is my body changing?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Highly successful Spanish ex-pro rider Alejandro Valverde, who retired recently aged 42.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>Life might begin at 40, but your body is starting to change. “Genetically, you hit your peak aged between 15 and 30, as that is when, in the distant past, you had the speed, strength and flexibility to outrun a predator,” explains Cavell.</p>\n<p>“So after 40, a cyclist’s testosterone, bone density and muscle mass are at the very top of the down slope.”</p>\n<p>These changes begin aged 30, but subtly make their mark in your 40s. As Cavell explains in <em>The Midlife Cyclist</em>, men face a decline in testosterone – vital for muscle strength, red blood cell production and fat regulation – of 1 per cent, per year; so by your 40s you may have a slight loss of muscle mass and bone-mineral density, and an increase in fat storage.</p>\n<p>Human growth hormone (HGH) – which supports muscle mass and aerobic capacity – also drops, contributing to a decline in muscle mass of 3 to 8 per cent, per decade.</p>\n<p>Female cyclists also experience changes. “By your late 30s and early 40s, you can get symptoms of perimenopause, from a reduction of oestrogen,” says Roberts.</p>\n<p>You may endure a loss of motivation, disrupted sleep and stress. “This impacts on performance and can lead to niggling injuries. Women also become more insulin-resistant, resulting in weight gain.”</p>\n<p>However, women are better protected than men from heart disease. “That is because oestrogen is a natural anti-inflammatory,” explains Cavell. Fortunately, cycling keeps your ticker strong, and riding for just 20 miles a week has been shown to slash your risk of heart disease by 50 per cent.</p>\n<p>“You may get a slight decline in joint, tendon and ligament health, and feel a bit stiff in the morning,” warns Roberts.</p>\n<h3>What changes should I make?</h3>\n<p>To counteract this slight age-related decline in muscle mass and bone density, cyclists over 40 should add in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-use-resistance-training-to-improve-your-cycling-strength/\">resistance training</a>, such as running or gym work.</p>\n<p>“The impact will cause the body to produce more muscle and bone mineral,” explains Cavell. “It will also aid weight control, along with your low-intensity rides, which burn fat.”</p>\n<p>Resistance training also supports testosterone production, as does eating zinc-rich food such as red meat, poultry, beans, nuts and seafood, and topping up your Vitamin D levels.</p>\n<p>Get lots of rest too. “Sleep is when you produce HGH, which will keep you performing well in your 40s,” says Cavell.</p>\n<p>Weight-lifting can also help female cyclists manage the perimenopause. “Lower oestrogen can cause insulin resistance, and weight gain,” explains Roberts.</p>\n<p>“Fat burning by riding for miles and miles won’t always work in your 40s, because of (underlying) hormonal change. You need to add strength training to help counter the insulin resistance.”</p>\n<p>All is not lost, though. “You can cycle at a very high level and do hard sessions,” says Cavell. “Just try to compensate for those small deficiencies.” And build healthy habits: stretching, good sleep, sensible nutrition and calming walks.</p>\n<h2>The 50s: how is my body changing?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Discuss any major health changes with your doctor.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Male cyclists are now 20 years past their peak in terms of testosterone, bone mineral and muscle mass. “There is an accelerated decline in your 50s,” warns Cavell.</p>\n<p>Female riders also face big changes. “Perimenopause is becoming menopause, so you’ve got that steep decline in oestrogen, which has effects on muscle strength and bone loss,” says Roberts.</p>\n<p>Both men and women may feel weaker on the bike, with strength declining by 30 per cent from age 50 to 70.</p>\n<p>Bone mineral loss is also speeding up. “Cyclists in their 50s who have only ever cycled may be slightly osteopenic (the precursor to osteoporosis),” warns Cavell.</p>\n<p>A review in <em>BMC Medicine</em> revealed that, because cycling is not weight-bearing, riders have a higher risk of low bone density.</p>\n<p>You will certainly feel a lot stiffer after rides. “In your 50s, your joints, tendons and ligaments get less flexible,” says Roberts. “The discs in the spine also dehydrate, so they become less gooey and cushioned. You may feel less flexible and be at risk of more injuries.”</p>\n<p>Watch out for weight gain, too, which will make life harder for you on climbs: our fasted glucose levels rise after the age of 50. This is possibly because we are less efficient at metabolising glucose.</p>\n<h3>What changes should I make?</h3>\n<p>“Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is available for women,” says Roberts.</p>\n<p>Men enduring symptoms of low testosterone – such as fatigue and muscle loss – should also see their GP, because blood tests and treatment are available.</p>\n<p>“Lifelong cyclists may now benefit from a DEXA (bone density) scan to check their condition,” adds Cavell.</p>\n<p>However, the best way for cyclists to preserve muscle mass, bone density and hormone levels is through extra resistance training. In your 40s, this is a welcome addition. In your 50s, it becomes crucial enough to replace some riding.</p>\n<p>“We need to do more work now,” warns Cavell. “In my opinion, that means dropping out cycling sessions and adding in resistance training, running and walking.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/8-stretches-to-improve-your-flexibility-and-cycling-performance/\">Yoga</a> and Pilates are great ways to counter the declining flexibility of your joints and spine. Injecting variety into your training will also help.</p>\n<p>“Cycling is all about being in flexion, so add a sport with more extension, like swimming, running or cross-country skiing, so you don’t get hunched,” suggests Cavell.</p>\n<p>Eating a higher proportion of complex grains such as brown rice or quinoa, and fibre-rich veggies can prevent <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/nutrition/how-to-lose-weight-cycling/\">weight gain</a>.</p>\n<p>HGH levels are glucose-sensitive, so eating less sugar will help with this as well as weight control. Eating more protein will help protect your muscle mass, and omega-3-rich fish helps heart health.</p>\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/hiit-interval-training/\">higher-intensity cycling</a> is still beneficial too, fitness permitting. “We want to bring back muscle power and heart health through a bit of intensity and VO2 max work,” says Roberts.</p>\n<h2>The 60s: how is my body changing?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Even healthy cyclists should keep an eye on their wellbeing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Joseph Branston / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Statistically, we are at higher risk of heart disease, cancer and diabetes in our 60s.</p>\n<p>The age-related decline in bone mineral and muscle mass now really gathers pace. “That is why a lot of older people start to walk a certain way and feel stiff,” says Cavell.</p>\n<p>The way we metabolise food also changes due to reduced insulin sensitivity over time, causing weight gain. “We are gaining fat but losing muscle, so we need to change that proposition consciously,” says Cavell.</p>\n<p>Daily hydration also becomes a much bigger challenge in your 60s. “Muscles carry water, so if you’ve got less muscle, you’re naturally less hydrated,” explains Cavell.</p>\n<p>“And we no longer metabolise alcohol efficiently, so drinking a lot in your 60s is not a great idea. You need to think about your inflammation burden – through stress and training – much more carefully as well.”</p>\n<h3>What changes should I make?</h3>\n<p>Sixty-something riders will benefit from an extra resistance session. “Drop out another cycling session and add in resistance training to preserve muscle mass, bone density and range of motion,” says Cavell. It’s time to adjust your diet too.</p>\n<p>Increasing your calcium intake, through milk, cheese, Greek yoghurt, eggs and leafy greens, can protect your bone health. Extra fruit and veg will aid your immunity.</p>\n<p>Omega-3-rich food, such as nuts, seeds and flaxseed, will help protect your heart and joints. Drinking more water will keep you hydrated as your muscle mass declines.</p>\n<p>Cycling is definitely going to feel harder now. But if you can keep cycling, you’re much less likely to suffer from certain diseases.</p>\n<p>“Exercise is an antidote to some of that,” says Roberts. Riding your bike is arguably now more important than ever. “We need to keep going, but just be more intelligent in the way we do it,” advises Cavell.</p>\n<p>Age-related muscle loss affects Type 2 ‘fast-twitch’ muscles more than Type 1 ‘slow-twitch’ muscles, which means you are now better suited to endurance rides than harder sessions. But aim for a blend of the two.</p>\n<p>“Do a bit of intensity stuff and the bedrock stuff,” says Cavell. He suggests staying a bit below your ideal heart-rate zones in training. However, cycling can serve as a handy health check tool in older age.</p>\n<p>“If your heart rate is fluctuating or abnormal during training, or you get stiff hips or knees, it’s worth seeing your GP,” says Roberts.</p>\n<p>You may find you enjoy different aspects of cycling, says Cavell. “You are capable of stunning performances, but all the dots have to join up.”</p>\n<h2>The 70s: how is my body changing?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Hugely inspiring 87-year-old <em>Cycling Plus</em> columnist, Norman Lazarus.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Liz Seabrook / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>By the time you hit your 70s, age is doing mischievous things to your body. “This accelerated decline is quite embedded now,” says Cavell.</p>\n<p>“Until the last few decades, 70- or 80-year-old athletes barely existed. Now there are plenty. But at this age, everything needs to be considered more.”</p>\n<p>Your muscle mass, bone density and hormone levels will have seriously dipped. You might also begin to lose your sense of balance, which can cause problems on a bike.</p>\n<p>“Age-related muscular decline affects balance,” says Roberts. “So falls are a major problem in your 70s and 80s, and breaking a bone can be harder to recover from at this age.”</p>\n<h3>What changes should I make?</h3>\n<p>First up: don’t think that you have to hang up your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-cycling-shoes/\">cycling shoes</a>. A sensible cycling routine will protect your heart health and mental health, and even help with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cycling-knee-pain-the-problem-areas/\">knee issues</a>, arthritis and joint health.</p>\n<p>“Cycling is actually prescribed by a lot of orthopaedic surgeons now for people with arthritis because it has such positive effects,” says Roberts.</p>\n<p>For most recreational cyclists, this is the time to enjoy rides for the sheer pleasure. But it is worth broadening your activities.</p>\n<p>“The bike is quite flattering as it is low loading, but sitting on your turbo trainer at 350 watts for 20 minutes does nothing for bone density or muscle mass,” says Cavell.</p>\n<p>“You don’t want to become one of those skinny bird-like cyclists who could function well on the bike but can’t function anywhere else.”</p>\n<p>To boost your functional fitness and bone and muscle health in older age, keep up those resistance-training habits from the previous decades. And add in extra challenges, such as single-leg balance drills.</p>\n<p>“Balance is something we can certainly train,” says Roberts.</p>\n<p>As each decade passes by – from 40s to 70s and beyond – consider adjusting your bike setup.</p>\n<p>“You are not that flexible person you were in your 20s, so revisit your bike fit,” advises Roberts. “Adapting your position to meet your reduced flexibility in the spine and hips will ensure you keep riding in comfort.”</p>\n<p>But the big message remains the same: keep riding – sensibly and safely – for as long as you want to. “I certainly want to be cycling into my 70s,” concludes Roberts. “If you can stay active into your 70s and beyond, that is an incredibly healing thing.”</p>\n\n<p> </p>","author":"Mark Bailey","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"25cd84a47d6e380019cd63f747f0ac4301bccf8c1cc520f1839726f5ca722dc4","category":"Cycling"}
