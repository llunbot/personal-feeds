In two-dimensional space $\\mathbb{R}^2$, it represents a subdivision of the plane based on given initial seeds. In this session, we are interested in the computational aspect of the diagram. Specifically, we will delve into an efficient algorithm proposed by Fortune in 1986. Although the original algorithm can be challenging to comprehend, we will explore a geometric interpretation that casts the problem in three-dimensional space $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This perspective offers a more intuitive understanding of the problem and unveils an intriguing connection to conic sections.</p>\n\n","author":"","siteTitle":"neizod's speculation","siteHash":"939338c5557b1743f2c128736c6006e145dcabc81da9970f1c0dc8ae2feb0830","entryHash":"c87e113efae82678f1f8157607611caa829012adcfa204cbf72170514023b703","category":"Thai"}
