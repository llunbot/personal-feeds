The display size is expected to remain the same at 10.2 inches, but it is said to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/thunderbolt-ipad-pro-coming-in-april/\">thinner</a> at 6.3mm, with a lighter overall design. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe tablet is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/06/low-cost-ipad-thinner-design/\">rumored</a> to include 4GB RAM with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> Home button and Lightning port. As with past versions of the ‌iPad‌, it will be aimed at students and those looking for an affordable tablet option.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>The entry level iPad is showing “currently unavailable” and/or shipping delays into October.

Apple on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/07/apple-september-14-event/\">sent out invites</a> to a \"California Streaming\" event on Tuesday, September 14, where it plans to debut the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> lineup, an Apple Watch Series 7, and possibly new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is also rumored to be working on a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-6/\">redesigned iPad mini</a>, but that device is not expected to feature at next week's event. Apple is expected to hold multiple events in the remainder of this year, so we could see it in October or November instead.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/08/8th-gen-ipad-stocks-run-low-apple-event/\">8th Generation iPad Stocks Running Low Ahead of Next Week's Apple Event</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/8th-generation-ipad-stocks-running-low-ahead-of-next-weeks-apple-event.2310032/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=73m3Fqjr0To:zpp60Css1gU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=73m3Fqjr0To:zpp60Css1gU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/73m3Fqjr0To\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"84e511b7cdab3a5111f4d7f2021e0e41fb411b9bc0449457ec9997dbfc615ab0","category":"Apple"}
