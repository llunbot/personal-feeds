{"title":"Opening Day, Bronx-Style","link":"https://www.mlb.com/yankees/news/aaron-judge-hits-first-home-run-of-2023","date":1680220349000,"content":"\n<p>Bryan Hoch, reporting for MLB:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There were familiar chants of “M-V-P!” as Aaron Judge strode\ntoward home plate in the first inning on Opening Day, digging his\nright cleat across the dirt of the batter’s box as he prepared for\nhis first official at-bat since being named the 16th captain in\nYankees franchise history.</p>\n\n<p>It took all of two pitches for Judge to pick up where he left off.\nHaving eclipsed Roger Maris’ single-season American League record\nwith 62 home runs last year, Judge belted the Majors’ first of\n2023, powering a Logan Webb sinker over the center-field wall at\nYankee Stadium as the Yankees cruised to a 5-0 win over the Giants\non Thursday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Opening Day is one of my favorite holidays of the year.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to Judge’s homer and Gerrit Cole’s 11 strikeouts, the game also marked the debut of <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/yankees/news/anthony-volpe-debut-yankees-opening-day\">21-year-old rookie shortstop Anthony Volpe</a>, the youngest player to start on Opening Day for the Yankees since Derek Jeter. No shame in losing to the Yankees, Giants fans. (Giants starter Logan Webb struck out 12 and gave up only 4 hits in 6 innings — a hell of a good outing that looks crooked on the scoreboard.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/30/opening-day-bronx-style\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"27d8daca5e256ab2d45990504ae09cf755e029c5d39cd51a8f538d81f8b94ea8","category":"Tech"}
