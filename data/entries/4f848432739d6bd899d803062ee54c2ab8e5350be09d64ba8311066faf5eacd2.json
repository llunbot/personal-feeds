But thanks to a new NES cartridge inspired by <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> for Nintendo's 8-bit console, you'll be able to play a new homebrew game with anyone on the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, <a href=\"https://super-tilt-bro.com/\"><em>Super Tilt Bro.</em></a> reached its <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brokestudio/super-tilt-bro-new-online-nes-game\">Kickstarter</a> funding goal <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Broke_Studio/status/1651140295264722944?s=20\">within 48 hours</a> of its launch. Its NES cartridge, developed by Paris-based independent developer Sylvain Gadrat and published by Broke Studio, will include a Wi-Fi chipset and antenna that lets it connect to the Internet for one-on-one online play.</p>\n<p>As Gadrat <a href=\"http://supertiltbro.wontfix.it/\">tells the story</a> on the <em>Super Tilt Bro.</em> website, the game's history began in 2016 when Gadrat rediscovered his old NES console in a storeroom and became fascinated with the 8-bit processor that powered it. His interest led to an ambitious project: porting <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> to the NES. Over time, the project evolved, and by 2018, Gadrat released the first version of <em>Super Tilt Bro.</em> as a homebrew game developed entirely in assembly language.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934890#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934890&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4f848432739d6bd899d803062ee54c2ab8e5350be09d64ba8311066faf5eacd2","category":"Tech"}
