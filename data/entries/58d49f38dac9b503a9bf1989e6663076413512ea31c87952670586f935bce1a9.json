There are updated emoji characters, a new app, and a bunch of other, smaller additions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iOS-18.4-Apple-Intelligence-Color-Palette-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\n<h2>New Emoji</h2>\r<br />\nThere are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/03/ios-18-4-emoji/\">new emoji characters</a> in iOS 18.4, including bags under eyes, fingerprint, leafless tree, root vegetable, harp, shovel, and splatter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iOS-18.4-Emoji-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Prioritize Notifications</h2>\r<br />\nIn beta 1, Apple added a Prioritize Notifications feature. In beta 2, Priority Notifications can be set up on a per-app basis, and it is no longer an all on or all off setting. Priority Notifications are highlighted in a separate section on the Lock Screen, so you see them first.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ios-18-4-prioritize-notifications.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nApple uses <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> to determine which notifications are important and should be shown with the priority label, but you can still swipe up to see all of your notifications in Notification Center.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Vision Pro App</h2>\r<br />\nIf you have a Vision Pro headset, you'll <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/03/vision-pro-app-ios-18-4-beta-2/\">see a Vision Pro app</a> on your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> after installing iOS 18.4. The Vision Pro app helps you discover and download content on the Vision Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/vision-pro-app.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThere are dedicated sections for Immersive Video, 3D movies, and more, with options to download apps directly to the Vision Pro without having to use the headset.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also added a dedicated My Vision Pro section with a user guide and tips for using the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Control Center Apple Intelligence Section</h2>\r<br />\nIn the Control Center, there's now <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/03/ios-18-4-apple-intelligence-control-center/\">an Apple Intelligence section</a>. It includes the Type to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> option that was in the now-removed ‌Siri‌ section, along with new options for activating ‌Siri‌ and using <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/\">Visual Intelligence</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ios-18-4-control-center-apple-intelligence.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Visual Intelligence Action Button</h2>\r<br />\nApple added a new Action Button option that activates ‌Visual Intelligence‌, and it can be used as an alternative to the Camera Control button for ‌Visual Intelligence‌ on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ios-18-4-visual-intelligence-action-button.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Visual Intelligence for iPhone 15 Pro Models</h2>\r<br />\n‌Visual Intelligence‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/03/ios-18-4-visual-intelligence-iphone-15-pro/\">is now available</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> Pro and ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro Max, marking the first time that Apple has made the feature available on an ‌iPhone‌ that's not an ‌iPhone 16‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-Visual-Intelligence.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSince the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro models do not have a Camera Control button, ‌Visual Intelligence‌ can be activated via the Control Center or with the Action Button.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Pause App Store Downloads</h2>\r<br />\nWhen you download an app from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, you can now pause the download right from the update list in the ‌App Store‌ rather than having to do it from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a> icon for the app. Before now, you could only stop and restart an installation entirely from the ‌App Store‌, with no option for stopping it entirely.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ios-18-4-app-store-pause-download.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nPausing and resuming works for both new downloads and app updates.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Shortcuts Actions</h2>\r<br />\nThere are multiple new actions for Apple apps in the Shortcuts app, most of which are for changing app settings.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ios-18-4-safari-settings.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nIn Maps, for example, there are actions for things like avoid busy roads, avoid tolls, volume level, directions on radio, and more. In Safari, you can use AutoFill information, toggle on pop-up blocking, close tabs, change search engine, and change the tab bar configuration, among other options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are Settings actions for Maps, Safari, Reminders, Calendar, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, Books, Notes, Voice Memos, and Weather.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Photos</h2>\r<br />\nThe Recently Deleted section of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> app now has one-tap options to delete all photos and to recover all photos. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ios-18-4-deleted-album.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1918\" height=\"997\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Wallet</h2>\r<br />\nIn the Wallet app, there is a new menu that includes Orders, Settings, and Subscriptions and Payments. It can be accessed by tapping on the three dots in the upper right corner, which used to be just for package tracking.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ios-18-4-wallet-app.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1835\" height=\"1032\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Maps EV Updates</h2>\r<br />\nBased on code in iOS 18.4, it looks like Apple plans to add support for using the North American Charging System (NACS) with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/\">Apple Maps</a> EV routing option. ‌Apple Maps‌ EV routing is only supported by a couple of Ford models and the Porsche Taycan, so it's limited.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn those vehicles, there should soon be an option to route to NACS chargers in addition to CCS charging stations. Tesla Superchargers are NACS chargers, for example, but right now the ‌Apple Maps‌ EV feature does not support them.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone 16e Support</h2>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a> users can download and install the iOS 18.4 beta starting with beta 2, as Apple has added ‌iPhone 16e‌ support.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone 12 Support</h2>\r<br />\nWith iOS 18.4 beta 1, the update was bricking some ‌iPhone‌ 12 models, so Apple pulled it. That prevented anyone with an ‌iPhone‌ 12 from installing the beta. With beta 2, Apple has fixed the issue, so iOS 18.4 is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/03/ios-18-4-beta-iphone-12-iphone-16e/\">once again available</a> on the ‌iPhone‌ 12.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is also now an iPadOS 18.4 beta 2 update available for iPads that had the same issue, including the eighth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, fourth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>, and all <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> ‌iPad Air‌ models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Release Date</h2>\r<br />\niOS 18.4 will be released to the public in early April.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/03/ios-18-4-beta-2-features/\">Everything New in iOS 18.4 Beta 2</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/everything-new-in-ios-18-4-beta-2.2451237/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"58d49f38dac9b503a9bf1989e6663076413512ea31c87952670586f935bce1a9","category":"Apple"}
