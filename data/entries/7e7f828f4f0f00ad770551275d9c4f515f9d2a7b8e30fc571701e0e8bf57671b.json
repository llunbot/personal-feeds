Back in 2015, Musk famously called Apple the \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2015/10/08/elon-musk-apple-hires-fired-tesla-workers/\">Tesla Graveyard</a>,\" and said \"If you don't make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn December, Musk claimed that he had attempted to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/22/elon-musk-tim-cook-tesla-meeting/\">speak with Apple</a> about a possible acquisition of Tesla at one point in Tesla's early days, but Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> refused to meet with him.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMore recently, Musk <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/26/elon-musk-apple-sniping-tesla-call/\">criticized</a> Apple's use of cobalt in its products and implied that its business model was a \"walled garden\" because Apple dictates what software can be installed on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and requires companies to use its ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nJust last month, it was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/30/elon-musk-wanting-to-become-apple-ceo/\">reported</a> that Musk once demanded that he be made Apple CEO in a brief discussion of a potential acquisition with ‌Tim Cook‌. Musk has since personally refuted the claim, and even denied that he and Cook have ever spoken or written to each other.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs for Isaacson, since the publication of his best-selling Jobs biography in 2011, the writer has spoken variously about Apple-related topics with keen insight, likely as a result of his deep dive into the company when Jobs was at the helm. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2017, he remarked that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/05/11/jobs-biographer-apple-no-longer-innovative/\">no longer the most innovative company</a>, and singled out Apple's lack of movement in the virtual assistant space as an example of where the company had been left behind by the likes of Google and Amazon.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2019, Isaacson also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/08/steve-jobs-criticized-tim-cook/\">revealed</a> that he had \"softened\" parts of Jobs' biography, particularly criticisms Jobs had made about ‌Tim Cook‌ for not being a \"product person.\" \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIsaacson's biography of Jobs went on to be the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2014/01/13/sorkin-completes-steve-jobs-script/\">basis</a> for Aaron Sorkin's screenplay of the Danny Boyle-directed film \"Steve Jobs.\" The film was well received by critics, earning four Golden Globe Award nominations and two Academy Award nominations.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/elon-musk/\">Elon Musk</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/05/jobs-biographer-walter-isaacson-musk-book/\">Steve Jobs' Biographer Walter Isaacson Is Writing a Book About Elon Musk</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/steve-jobs-biographer-walter-isaacson-is-writing-a-book-about-elon-musk.2306590/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mNl0dJwLoQo:tqAV9NRmpSc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mNl0dJwLoQo:tqAV9NRmpSc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/mNl0dJwLoQo\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7e7f828f4f0f00ad770551275d9c4f515f9d2a7b8e30fc571701e0e8bf57671b","category":"Apple"}
