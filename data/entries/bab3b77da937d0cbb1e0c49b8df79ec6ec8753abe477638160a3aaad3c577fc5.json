According to SellCell's depreciation analysis, previous SE models have seen significantly faster value loss than standard iPhones. The third-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ lost 42.6% of its value within the first month and 57.8% after six months, compared to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> lineup, which saw a decline of 28.8% in the first month and 27.8% after six months.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA similar pattern was seen with the second-generation ‌iPhone SE‌, which experienced a 50.8% drop in value within six months, whereas the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> series saw a 31.1% decrease over the same period. This is likely due to the ‌iPhone SE‌'s lower starting price, use of older designs, and lower overall demand in the second-hand market.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, it is worth noting that some smaller and lower-cost iPhones have managed to retain their value more effectively. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 13 mini held its value significantly better than the SE models. The device lost only 19.2% of its value in the first month, compared to 42.6% for the third-generation SE, and after 12 months, it had depreciated by 46.1%, compared to 64.4% for the third-generation SE. Even at 24 months, the ‌iPhone‌ 13 mini had lost just 53% of its original value, positioning it closer to flagship models than to SE devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs the new ‌iPhone SE‌ is expected to adopt a more modern design with significantly upgraded specifications, it could potentially alter the depreciation trend that has defined previous ‌iPhone SE‌ models. The shift to an ‌iPhone‌ 14-style design could improve long-term demand, and if Apple equips it with a considerably more high-end chipset and camera system as expected, as well as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> support, it may retain value more effectively than its predecessors because it will remain competitive in the lineup for longer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLike other devices, the ‌iPhone SE‌ sees continued depreciation following the launch of a successor. The second-generation SE saw an additional 4% drop in value within 12 weeks of the third-generation SE's release. They tend to see accelerated depreciation after their initial launch window, meaning those looking to upgrade should do so quickly after launch to maximize resale value.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPricing will also be a key factor in determining the fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌'s long-term value retention. Reports suggest the device may start at up to $499 in the United States, marking a slight increase from the current model's $429 price. While this could keep the new ‌iPhone SE‌ a compelling option for budget-conscious customers, it also raises expectations for hardware improvements that justify the price increase.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's decision to delay the launch of the fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ beyond its usual two-year upgrade cycle has also created a larger gap in its lineup, leaving fewer affordable options with up-to-date hardware. This may result in increased demand for the new ‌iPhone SE‌ when it launches, particularly if it offers substantial upgrades over previous models as expected.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sellcell/\">SellCell</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/iphone-se-4-could-change-resale-market/\">iPhone SE 4's Specs Could Lead to Enhanced Resale Value</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4s-specs-could-lead-to-enhanced-resale-value.2449640/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bab3b77da937d0cbb1e0c49b8df79ec6ec8753abe477638160a3aaad3c577fc5","category":"Apple"}
