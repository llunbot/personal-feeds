You’re coming\nhere with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over\nIndia.’ I don’t want you building in India.”</p>\n\n<p>Trump was referencing Apple’s commitment of a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/apple-to-open-texas-ai-server-factory-in-500-billion-us-expansion.html\">$500 billion\ninvestment</a> in the U.S. which was announced in February.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And which would have <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/apple-500-billion-american-manufacturing-plan\">almost certainly been the same thing they would have announced</a> if Kamala Harris had won the election. They announced <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years/\">a $430 billion US investment in 2021</a>, in the first year of the Biden administration.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple has been ramping up production in India with the aim of\nmaking around 25% of global iPhones in the country in the next few\nyears, as it looks to reduce reliance on China, where around 90%\nof its flagship smartphone is currently assembled.</p>\n\n<p>“I said to Tim, I said, ‘Tim look, we treated you really good, we\nput up with all the plants that you build in China for years, now\nyou got build us [<em>sic</em>]. We’re not interested in you building in India,\nIndia can take care of themselves ... we want you to build here,’”\nTrump said.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. president added that Apple is going to be “upping” its\nproduction in the United States, without disclosing further\ndetails.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If Apple were to assemble a single iPhone in the United States, that would be upping its US iPhone production, which, since the original iPhone in 2007, is at zero. It’s not a matter of willpower or spending — <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/09/trump-think-us-has-resources-to-make-iphones\">it just isn’t possible</a> at anything even vaguely approaching the iPhone’s scale.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/15/trump-cook-apple-india\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"bff6a150bb6235e9de51affaf3864681a6dd33d8b4539f19d13b320ee0c055e7","category":"Tech"}
