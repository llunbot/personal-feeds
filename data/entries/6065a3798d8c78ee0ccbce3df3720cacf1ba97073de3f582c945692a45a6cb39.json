Basically, you can get awesome audio whether you’re on the go or at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2nd Gen AirPods come with some awesome features. Powered by the Apple H1 headphone chip, these AirPods provide hands-free access to Siri using just your voice, making it easier to manage tasks on the go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our review of the AirPods 2nd Gen, our expert gave these earbuds a 4.5/5 star rating, and the super easy access to Siri was at the top of his list of reasons why you should get this model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We still think Siri needs to get a lot better and desperately needs the ability to fully function with third-party music services just as well as it does with Apple Music. But AirPods are best in situations where your hands are occupied: at the gym, riding a bike, bundled up in freezing cold weather. I didn’t realize how useful it would be to use Siri with my phone in my pocket and my hands full until I had the ability to,” Jason Cross wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stellar battery life, rich audio, and clear voice are among the things that make the AirPods 2nd Gen worth buying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The HomePod mini is also part of this bundle. This small smart speaker has a great design and a decent sound, earning a 3.5/5 star rating. The speaker provides 360-degree sound and can serve as an easy way to access the smart assistant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This bundle combines the convenience of portable earbuds with the powerful sound of a smart speaker, making it ideal for a wide range of listening needs.
