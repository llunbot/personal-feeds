So an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a> 1, Series 4, or Series 5 owner running an older version of watchOS cannot install watchOS 10.6.1 at the current time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFurther, some Apple Watch models running earlier versions of watchOS 10 cannot be paired to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis issue only applies to Apple Watch models that are limited to watchOS 10, and it is further only applicable to those not already running watchOS 10.6.1, an update that came out last August. Apple will likely fix this issue in the near future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks, lunotech11!)</em><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/watchos-update-issue-older-models/\">Apple Breaks watchOS Updates On Older Apple Watch Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-breaks-watchos-updates-on-older-apple-watch-models.2448237/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"07d7cc26902e5af10df1c5377bf19ce002bd60eeaa561dc9b1160e23c6d634f6","category":"Apple"}
