Now, it’s time to wait for the routes of next year’s big tours to be revealed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ASO, the honchos behind the Tour de France, will reveal the 2025 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France </a>and Tour de France Femmes routes on Tuesday 29th October 2024 with a grand ceremony in Paris. Two weeks later, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia </a>organiser RCS will share the route of the 2025 edition on Tuesday 12th November 2024. The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta a España</a>‘s route reveal doesn’t have a specific date as yet, but it is expected to be published in December.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, we are able to focus on the substantial rumours that surround the potential routes of these races. Often, organisers scout potential stage locations months before the Grand Tour routes are announced visit and news of local councils bidding for stage rights is also widely reported before the official routes are revealed at the end of the year. With these leads, the possible routes of the 2025 Tour de France, Giro d’Italia and Vuelta a España can be closely predicted.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Giro d’Italia 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2151874952-min-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2151874952-min-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2151874952-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2151874952-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2151874952-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2151874952-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2151874952-min-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2151874952-min-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2151874952-min-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2151874952-min-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2151874952-min-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2025 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia</a> will take place between 10th May and 1st June 2025. No details of the <em>percorso </em>have been officially announced by RCS, the Giro organiser. This includes where the race will start – known as the <em>Grande Partenza</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumours surrounding the Giro are cooking up quite the complete image, however. A number of cycling-specific and local news sources have revealed much of the apparent route, which could start outside of Italy for the first time since 2020. We won’t have to guess for much longer, however, as the full Giro d’Italia route will be unveiled in Rome on 12th November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Current rumours suggest that <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jonas-vingegaard\" target=\"_blank\">Jonas Vingegaard</a>, the two-time Tour de France champion, will be among the starters. Romain Bardet will make his last Grand Tour appearance at the Italian race and it is expected that Enric Mas will make his Giro debut next year.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-does-tadej-pogacar-still-have-to-win\">GOAT Bingo: What does Tadej Pogačar still have left to win?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/three-week-tour-of-britain\">What would a three-week Tour of Britain route look like?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/weird-grand-tour-starts\">The weird and wonderful places to have hosted a Grand Tour stage</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mont-ventoux-cycling\">Classic climb: Mont Ventoux, the Giant of Provence</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h3>Week one: Albanian <em>Grande Partenza</em>, Abruzzo and another visit to Naples</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-852892076-min-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"albania giro d'italia\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-852892076-min-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-852892076-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-852892076-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-852892076-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-852892076-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-852892076-min-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-852892076-min-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-852892076-min-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-852892076-min-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-852892076-min-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Eugert Zhupa is the most recent Albanian to compete at the Giro d’Italia. Between 2015 and 2018, Zhupa finished the Giro on four occasions.</figcaption><figcaption>Kei Tsuji/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, Albania is in pole position to host the <em>Grande Partenza</em> in 2025. Back in the spring, it was reported that the Giro ‘might start in a country that has never hosted a Grand Tour stage’. Since then, Albania has emerged as the assumed host of the 2025 Giro’s first stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This comes after a close battle between the Balkan nation and the Friuli Venezia Giulia region, which was looking to centre the<em> Grande Partenza</em> around Trieste. However, according to <em><a href=\"https://ricerca.gelocal.it/messaggeroveneto/archivio/messaggeroveneto/2024/06/26/gorizia-document-51.html?ref=search\" target=\"_blank\">Il Messaggero Veneto</a></em> and <em>Tuttobici</em>, Albanian organisers offered a multi-million euro package to secure hosting rights for the opening three stages of the 2025 Giro. <a href=\"https://www.tuttobiciweb.it/article/1719430134\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tuttobici</em> </a>claims that the Albanian bid offer was three times larger than Trieste’s. Spanish newspaper <em><a href=\"https://as.com/ciclismo/giro_italia/el-giro-2025-tiene-punto-de-partida-albania-n/\" target=\"_blank\">AS</a> </em>has hinted that the official announcement will come after Il Lombardia next weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Details of the route in Albania are thin. Expectations are that the race will start in the capital Tirana, most likely with a prologue. <em><a href=\"https://www.vcoazzurratv.it/giro-2025-nel-vco-tante-voci-sulle-testate-specializzate/sport/\" target=\"_blank\">VcoAzzura</a> </em>has pointed toward a Stage 2 finish<em> </em>in Vlorë. Based on logistics, Durrës might host Stage 3. The coastal resort provides transport options back to the Italian mainland where the race will continue, plus the area has been used frequently in the Tour of Albania. There is a long-time connection between Italy and Albania. Italy occupied the Balkan nation for much of the 20th century, and a large Albanian diaspora has grown across the Adriatic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the race back on the mainland, some direction of the route has been rumoured. Either Puglia or Abruzzo will kick off proceedings. Yet another visit to Naples is expected during week one before the race moves up the spine of Italy via Tuscany and Emilia Romagna. Details are thin on the ground surrounding the remaining stages in this first week.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Week two: The long-awaited Monte Crostis, a time-trial and the Dolomites</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/CAuldPhoto-2024-GirodItalia-Stage19-0890-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/CAuldPhoto-2024-GirodItalia-Stage19-0890-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/CAuldPhoto-2024-GirodItalia-Stage19-0890-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/CAuldPhoto-2024-GirodItalia-Stage19-0890-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/CAuldPhoto-2024-GirodItalia-Stage19-0890-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/CAuldPhoto-2024-GirodItalia-Stage19-0890-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/CAuldPhoto-2024-GirodItalia-Stage19-0890-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/CAuldPhoto-2024-GirodItalia-Stage19-0890-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/CAuldPhoto-2024-GirodItalia-Stage19-0890-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/CAuldPhoto-2024-GirodItalia-Stage19-0890-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/CAuldPhoto-2024-GirodItalia-Stage19-0890.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Chris Auld</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Murmurs point towards the second week being concentrated in Italy’s northeast. With this, Vicenza is expected to host Stage 12 and Stage 13 is likely to be a time-trial to Montebello Vicentino in the region of Veneto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.tuttobiciweb.it/article/1726693485\" target=\"_blank\">Tuttobici </a></em>has revealed that Fruili will host a weekend of racing. This is expected to slot in for Stages 14 and 15. Some sources speculate that Monte Crostis could appear at the 2025 Giro. The climb has rarely featured in the race and was even removed from the route in 2011 due to safety concerns. While close to the Slovenian border, Stage 14 is expected to finish in Gorizia, which hosted a stage back in 2021 won by Victor Campanaerts. Gorizia will also be celebrating its year as the European Capital of Culture in 2025. With this in mind, the region is confident that the border town will receive a stage next year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Stage 15, at the end of week two, the race has been rumoured to have a big <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/dolomites\" target=\"_blank\">Dolomite</a> stage up to the Col Drusciè, which the Giro hasn’t visited since the 1970s. Few people have ventured up this climb by bike, but some investigating reveals that the climb is a real steep kicker in excess of 9% in average gradient. The standard of paving towards the summit is unclear.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Week three: Alps, the Valle d’Aosta and a Vatican time-trial</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage21-8091-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclists going past Colosseum in Rome\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage21-8091-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage21-8091-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage21-8091-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage21-8091-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage21-8091-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage21-8091-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage21-8091-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage21-8091-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage21-8091-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage21-8091-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Chris Auld</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Reports suggest that the peloton will then move towards the Alps via Bormio and Bergamo at the beginning of the final week of racing. According to local newspaper <em><a href=\"https://aostasera.it/notizie/sport/giro-ditalia-2025-tappa-valle-daosta/\" target=\"_blank\">Aosta Sera</a></em>, the northwest of Italy is expected to host the final three mountain challenges of the 2025 Giro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not far from the Swiss border, Stage 18 is rumoured to make a visit to Cascate del Toce. Marco Pantani took his final Giro stage win here back in 2003. The Valle d’Aosta in the northwest corner of Italy is expected to host a mountain stage the next day. This is suggested to take place between Borgomanero and Ayas. This comes after a long campaign from the region to host the Corsa Rosa again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same article also suggests a Stage 20 showdown between Canavese and Sestriere.

Some regional news sources have stated that this is scheduled for Stage 16 of the race. <em><a href=\"https://www.ledauphine.com/tour-de-france/2024/09/20/le-tour-de-france-devrait-passer-par-le-vaucluse-en-2025\" target=\"_blank\">Le Dauphiné Libéré</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.lamarseillaise.fr/sports/tour-de-france-2025-vers-une-arrivee-au-sommet-du-ventoux-AH16667421\" target=\"_blank\">La Marseillaise</a></em> have both quoted the president of the local Vaucluse <em>département </em>as saying ‘there is a strong chance that the Tour will pass through [Vaucluse] in 2025’.

Some have suggested Valence and Grenoble as possible host locations.

The climb hasn’t featured in the men’s Tour since 2022, so it might be apt to see the race return. There are few leads on this rumour, so it may be subject to change. However, <em>Cyclist</em> research has unearthed that hotel availability in Bourg d’Oisans is lower than usual for the dates put forward by <em>Le Dauphiné Libéré</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another bumper day in the Alps is forecasted for Stage 19. This day is widely rumoured to end with a summit finish to La Plagne. The 17km long climb hasn’t appeared on the Tour since 2002. It was, however, a summit finish in the 2021 Critérium du Dauphiné. On that occasion, Mark Padun took the stage win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumours point towards the 20th Stage heading out of the Alps. <em><a href=\"https://www.estrepublicain.fr/sport/2024/09/29/le-tour-de-france-2025-a-pontarlier\" target=\"_blank\">L’Est Républicain</a></em> believes that the stage will start in Annemasse, the hometown of the Paret-Peintre brothers. <em><a href=\"https://www.ledauphine.com/tour-de-france/2024/09/28/tour-de-france-2025-l-alpe-d-huez-la-plagne-et-albertville-au-menu\" target=\"_blank\">Le Dauphiné Libéré</a></em> claims that the stage will end in the Doubs <em>département</em>, potentially in the town of Pontarlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a year spent away from the French capital due to the 2024<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/olympics\" target=\"_blank\"> Olympic Games</a> last July, the Tour de France returns to the Champs-Elysées in 2025. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-fix-the-tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Don’t get your hopes up</a> of another time-trial showdown on the Côte d’Azur.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tour de France Femmes 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-20T140341.647-970x647.png\" alt=\"kasia niewiadoma tour de france femmes 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-20T140341.647-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-20T140341.647-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-20T140341.647-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-20T140341.647-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-20T140341.647-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-20T140341.647-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-20T140341.647-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-20T140341.647-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-20T140341.647-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-20T140341.647.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2024 Tour de France Femmes route was a real step up from previous years. The event started outside of France and featured a big mountaintop finale on the iconic Alpe d’Huez. For 2025, the stakes have been raised. The race will expand by a stage, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-news-tour-de-france-femmes-2025#:~:text=2025%20Tour%20de%20France%20Femmes%20to%20grow%20to%20nine%20stages&amp;text=The%20Tour%20de%20France%20Femmes,stages%20for%20the%202024%20edition.\" target=\"_blank\">bringing it out to nine stages</a>. This will make next year’s edition the longest Tour de France Femmes in its short history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2025 edition returns to its late-July slot. The race will start in Vannes on 26th July and will finish (perhaps in the Alps) on 3rd August. The location of the <em>Grand Départ </em>has been confirmed for a while now – Brittany has been selected to host the opening three stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stage 1 will head out from Vannes and head to Plumelec. The following day, the racing heads to the north of the region with a profile from Brest to Quimper. This will most likely end in an uphill sprint. La Gacilly rounds out our time in Brittany before the race heads towards the centre of France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although route details rightfully remain very secret, the general direction of the race looks to be southeasterly towards the Alps. As part of this, Stage 4 is likely to move into the Massif Central. <em><a href=\"https://www.lamontagne.fr/clermont-ferrand-63000/sports/tours-de-france-hommes-et-femmes-le-puy-de-dome-encore-a-la-fete-en-2025_14565952/?s=33\" target=\"_blank\">La Montagne</a></em> suggests that the following stage will begin in Clermont-Ferrand and end in Ambert via the Col du Béal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final weekend is rumoured to be centred around the Alps. Chambéry is said to be the start town of Stage 8, a tough mountain stage that will finish in Maurienne. Given that this area is right in the thick of legendary Alpine climbs, there is some reason to believe that the<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/col-du-galibier-cycling\" target=\"_blank\"> Col du Galibier </a>could be on the 2025 <em>parcours</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ledauphine.com/sport/2024/09/28/tour-de-france-femmes-2025-une-arrivee-finale-a-chatel-un-depart-a-chambery\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Le Dauphiné Libéré</em> </a>has hinted that the ski resort Châtel will host the arrival of Stage 9, the final stage of the 2025 Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Vuelta a España 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20240908VUE5017-Unipublic_Sprint_Cycling_Agency-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20240908VUE5017-Unipublic_Sprint_Cycling_Agency-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20240908VUE5017-Unipublic_Sprint_Cycling_Agency-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20240908VUE5017-Unipublic_Sprint_Cycling_Agency-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20240908VUE5017-Unipublic_Sprint_Cycling_Agency-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20240908VUE5017-Unipublic_Sprint_Cycling_Agency-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20240908VUE5017-Unipublic_Sprint_Cycling_Agency-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20240908VUE5017-Unipublic_Sprint_Cycling_Agency-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20240908VUE5017-Unipublic_Sprint_Cycling_Agency-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20240908VUE5017-Unipublic_Sprint_Cycling_Agency-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20240908VUE5017-Unipublic_Sprint_Cycling_Agency-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Unipublic/Sprint Cycling Agency</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Italian media, the Italian region of Piedmont will host the <em>Gran Salida</em> of the 2025 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta a España</a>. In June, the Vuelta director Javier Guillén, said, ‘I am very happy to say that La Vuelta and Piedmont are getting closer. We are in discussions and working hard. If it works out, it would give us great satisfaction,’ he continued. Turin and Venaria Reale are among the rumoured stage hosts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Piedmont held the Giro’s<em> Grande Partenza</em> in 2024 and Turin held a stage of the Tour de France earlier this year. The northern Italian city will, therefore, have hosted all three Grand Tours in the space of just two years. This will also mark the second Vuelta foreign start in a row. With Monaco rumoured for 2026, that could soon be three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of the Italian start, little is known about next year’s Vuelta a España route.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing we are suspecting is a cameo from the Alto de l’Angliru. Newspaper <em><a href=\"https://t.co/tLwTmFfrk5\" target=\"_blank\">La Nueva España </a></em>revealed that the local mayor has asked Vuelta organisers to make a visit to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/angliru-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Angliru</a>. The infernally steep mountain was last used in 2023 in a stage won by<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\"> Primož Roglič</a>. The inclusion of the Angliru would possibly be the focal point of the Vuelta’s three-week route.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-does-tadej-pogacar-still-have-to-win\">GOAT Bingo: What does Tadej Pogačar still have left to win?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/three-week-tour-of-britain\">What would a three-week Tour of Britain route look like?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/weird-grand-tour-starts\">The weird and wonderful places to have hosted a Grand Tour stage</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mont-ventoux-cycling\">Classic climb: Mont Ventoux, the Giant of Provence</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/grand-tour-2025-route-rumours\">Grand Tour 2025 route rumours: What we know so far</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"cccc9c2fe7f01b98ad4cf1b307a86a3855cf0726775311ed6ec9804f65d19050","category":"Cycling"}
