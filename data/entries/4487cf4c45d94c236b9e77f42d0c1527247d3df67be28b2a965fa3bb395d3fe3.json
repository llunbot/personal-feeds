Or maybe you’re just tired of giving the same old boring socks and gift cards. Here’s a fresh idea: a <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/sams-club-1-year-membership-with-auto-renew?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sams-club-1-year-membership-with-auto-renew&amp;utm_term=scsf-610025&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002gSGVIA2&amp;scsonar=1\">Sam’s Club membership</a> for just $20 (normally $50). It’s practical, it’s unexpected, and it’s a gift that keeps on giving for a full year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about it: Who wouldn’t want to buy mountains of snacks, enough toilet paper to build a fort (okay, maybe not), and TVs bigger than your average apartment window? Plus, they’ll score <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/sams-club-1-year-membership-with-auto-renew?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sams-club-1-year-membership-with-auto-renew&amp;utm_term=scsf-610025&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002gSGVIA2&amp;scsonar=1\">deals on everything from groceries to electronics</a>, which means more money in their pocket for, well, whatever they want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here’s the real kicker: A Sam’s Club membership also unlocks <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/sams-club-1-year-membership-with-auto-renew?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sams-club-1-year-membership-with-auto-renew&amp;utm_term=scsf-610025&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002gSGVIA2&amp;scsonar=1\">discounts on travel</a>, entertainment, and movie tickets. So basically, you’re giving the gift of experiences, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have until Christmas Day to grab this Sam’s Club membership deal at $20 (reg. $50). No coupon is needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/sams-club-1-year-membership-with-auto-renew?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=sams-club-1-year-membership-with-auto-renew&amp;utm_term=scsf-610025&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002gSGVIA2&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp3.stackassets.com/101c19ce72f8f022bda1a4dc71fcff11b506f974/store/85a4df24b0701ba8154c3e2bcaf10cbbdcc06442a048be96b04f83427e5f/sale_322614_primary_image.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sam’s Club 1-Year Membership with Auto-Renew! – $20</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/sams-club-1-year-membership-with-auto-renew?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=sams-club-1-year-membership-with-auto-renew&amp;utm_term=scsf-610025&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002gSGVIA2&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com/\">StackSocial</a> prices subject to change.</em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4487cf4c45d94c236b9e77f42d0c1527247d3df67be28b2a965fa3bb395d3fe3","category":"Apple"}
