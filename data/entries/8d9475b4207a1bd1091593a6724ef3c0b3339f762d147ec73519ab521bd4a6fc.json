What could have prevented that attack (and so many others) was an un-spoofable form of authentication for the device itself.</p>\n\n<p>That’s what you get with <a href=\"https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball\">Kolide’s device trust solution</a>: a chance to verify that a device is both known and secure before it authenticates. Kolide’s agent looks at hundreds of device properties; their competitors look at only a handful. What’s more, Kolide’s user-first, privacy-respecting approach means you can put it on machines outside MDM: contractor devices, mobile phones, and even Linux machines.</p>\n\n<p>Without a device trust solution, all the security in the world is just security theater. But Kolide can help close the gaps.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/07/kolide\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8d9475b4207a1bd1091593a6724ef3c0b3339f762d147ec73519ab521bd4a6fc","category":"Tech"}
