The series was created by David Benioff, D.B. Weiss (<em>Game of Thrones</em>), and Alexander Woo (<em>True Blood</em>). CES attendees also had the opportunity to participate in a <em>3 Body Problem</em> \"immersive experience,\" intended to transport them \"into the mysterious world of the series in a fun and experimental way.\"</p>\n<p><strong>(Some spoilers for the novel below.)</strong></p>\n<p>The novel began as serialized fiction in Science Fiction World in 2006 and received the Galaxy (Yinhe) Award for Chinese science fiction that same year. Liu published it as a standalone book in 2008. But it was Ken Liu's 2014 English translation for Tor Books—complete with informative footnotes to acquaint Western readers with the many references to Chinese history, particularly the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution\">Cultural Revolution</a>—that rocketed <em>The Three-Body Problem</em> to international acclaim. Liu is also the author of two follow-up novels to complete the trilogy (<em>The Dark Forest</em> and <em>Death's End</em>), as well as <em>The Wandering Earth</em>—adapted into film in 2019—and <em>Ball Lightning</em>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994542#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994542&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8dd26673dcdfc8d098179129bf7615aa426521ca961aaed2f9faeec28182c517","category":"Tech"}
