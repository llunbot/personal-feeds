The move appears to come in response to widely encountered <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/iphone-15-pro-overheating-reports/\">overheating issues</a> experienced with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, which Apple addressed through a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-releases-ios-17-0-3/\">software update</a> earlier this year. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nGraphene has high thermal conductivity, surpassing that of copper, which is currently used in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> heat-sinks. Apple has been interested in graphene for thermal management for some time, filing patents related to its exploration of the material for heat dissipation in portable devices. Apple previously transitioned the Apple Watch's battery from black foil casings to ones made of metal with the Series 7, so an equivalent change on the ‌iPhone‌ seems plausible.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/\">Kosutami</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/iphone-16-new-thermal-design/\">iPhone 16 Rumored to Feature New Thermal Design</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-rumored-to-feature-new-thermal-design.2411142/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"275fc5237c3ee839d986557e475749c7121fedd64da5dd7f6b5486fe4345cb22","category":"Apple"}
