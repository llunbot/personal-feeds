After using 1TB, customers could keep accessing the Internet at slower (but unspecified) speeds or pay $0.25 per gigabyte for \"additional priority access.\"</p>\n<p>This was originally supposed to take effect in December, but Starlink <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/spacex-again-delays-imposing-high-speed-data-caps-for-starlink\">delayed</a> the change to February and then to April. But now, Starlink's <a href=\"https://support.starlink.com/\">list of support FAQs</a> no longer mentions the residential data cap, and the <a href=\"https://www.starlink.com/legal/documents/DOC-1134-82708-70\">current version</a> of the fair use policy says that standard service plan users have unlimited data. The <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230331073947/https://www.starlink.com/legal/documents/DOC-1134-82708-70\">previous version</a> of the Starlink fair use policy described the 1TB residential cap and optional $0.25-per-gigabyte overage fees.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936523#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936523&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d6737520003eef425094d54883d079dbaa09e04b11ca558dbda4818163bd641d","category":"Tech"}
