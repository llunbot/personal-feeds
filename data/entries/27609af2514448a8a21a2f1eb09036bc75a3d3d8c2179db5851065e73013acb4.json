{"title":"Mac Otakara: iPad Air 5 to Feature iPad Pro-Like Design, No Design Changes Coming to iPad Mini 6 or iPad 9","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/27/mac-otakara-ipad-air-5-design/","date":1627409175000,"content":"The next-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> will feature a design that's similar to the third-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, according to Japanese site <em><a href=\"http://www.macotakara.jp/blog/rumor/entry-41593.html\">Mac Otakara</a></em>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/iPad-Pro-Feature-Magenta.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nCiting a Chinese supplier, the site says that the fifth-generation ‌iPad Air‌ will continue to feature a 10.9-inch display and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> button on the side, but it will gain a dual-lens camera system with Wide and Ultra Wide cameras.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA LiDAR Scanner is also a possibility for the ‌iPad Air‌, though it is not guaranteed and the supplier did not know for sure. Additional features include a four speaker audio system and a 5G mmWave chip.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Mac Otakara</em> expects the fifth-generation ‌iPad Air‌ to feature an A15 chip, and while today's rumor includes no detail on a release date, prior information has suggested an early 2022 launch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere's also no mention of an OLED display, and multiple other rumors have suggested that Apple is working on an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> Air-sized ‌iPad‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/04/ipad-macbook-oled-displays-2022-rumor/\">with an OLED display</a>. The ‌iPad Air‌ is expected to use OLED technology while the ‌iPad Pro‌ line will stick with mini-LED technology.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Mac Otakara</em> also says that its \"latest information\" indicates the upcoming ninth-generation low-cost ‌iPad‌ and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> 6 \"do not seem to be any different\" from the existing eighth-generation ‌iPad‌ and ‌iPad mini‌ 5.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe site suggests that it's possible that the only update will be an update to the A14 chip, with a design change not coming until 2022 or later.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThat is not in line with previous rumors, especially about the ‌iPad mini‌ 6. We've heard <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ipad-mini-redesign-coming-2021/\">reports from reliable sources</a> like Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> and <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman that have suggested the next ‌iPad mini‌ will have a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/26/ipad-mini-6-display-design-info/\">larger display</a> and possibly no Home button.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌iPad mini‌ 6 is expected to come out this fall, so we don't have too much longer to wait to find out which rumor set is true. We're either getting a small refresh that does not tweak the design, or a larger refresh that brings the ‌iPad mini‌ in line with the ‌iPad Pro‌ and ‌iPad Air‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs for the low-cost ‌iPad‌, <em>Mac Otakara</em> earlier this year said that it would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/06/low-cost-ipad-thinner-design/\">look similar to the iPad Air 3</a>, but it's no longer clear if that's accurate.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini 5</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macotakara-jp/\">macotakara.jp</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/27/mac-otakara-ipad-air-5-design/\">Mac Otakara: iPad Air 5 to Feature iPad Pro-Like Design, No Design Changes Coming to iPad Mini 6 or iPad 9</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-otakara-ipad-air-5-to-feature-ipad-pro-like-design-no-design-changes-coming-to-ipad-mini-6-or-ipad-9.2305683/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=vwEa_gxNgjQ:EY--QNCQ_vQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=vwEa_gxNgjQ:EY--QNCQ_vQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/vwEa_gxNgjQ\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"27609af2514448a8a21a2f1eb09036bc75a3d3d8c2179db5851065e73013acb4","category":"Apple"}
