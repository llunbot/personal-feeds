Those are two areas where a user would want the least amount of lag possible â€” something that can't be guaranteed by a fully wireless system.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is unclear when Apple plans to release either of these headsets. The current Vision Pro was released in February 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman added that one of Apple CEO Tim Cook's top priorities remains true augmented reality glasses, but such a product likely remains \"many years\" away.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/13/vision-pro-2-two-rumored-upgrades/\">Vision Pro 2 Rumored to Have Two Key Advantages Over Current Model</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/vision-pro-2-rumored-to-have-two-key-advantages-over-current-model.2455238/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b8a1cd7008f4debce21632c5ec0fb3180ea6731d61dc5265e2b6a1014a0d53f6","category":"Apple"}
