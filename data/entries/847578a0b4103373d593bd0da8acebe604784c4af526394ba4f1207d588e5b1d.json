Nope, they are manufactured and distributed by a company by the name of <a href=\"https://nplusbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">N Plus North America</a>. As I checked out the N+ website, I saw that this is something they do, make bicycles for automobile brands. New to me. None of the pictures on the Ford site or the N+ site, for that matter, looked like real photos. They look to be renderings to me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, I’ll tell you what I found out about them. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Bronco-control-panel.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"558\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Bronco-control-panel.jpeg\" alt=\"Ford Bronco and Mustang eBikes Bronco control panel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Bronco-control-panel.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Bronco-control-panel-297x207.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Bronco-control-panel-120x84.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Bronco-control-panel-768x536.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Bronco control panel</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-mustang-control-pannel.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"583\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-mustang-control-pannel.jpeg\" alt=\"Ford Bronco and Mustang eBikes mustang control pannel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-mustang-control-pannel.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-mustang-control-pannel-297x216.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-mustang-control-pannel-120x87.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-mustang-control-pannel-768x560.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Mustang control panel</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ford Mustang eBike</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $4000</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start with the angles on the Mustang eBike. To me, they seem harsh and sharp. But Ford says they are “bold and chiseled”. Ok. They also say that “every line, curve, and angle has been inspired to evoke the sixty years of power and performance excellence you’ve come to expect from a Ford Mustang.” Yeah…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-with-mustang.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-with-mustang.jpeg\" alt=\"Ford Bronco and Mustang eBikes with mustang\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-with-mustang.jpeg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-with-mustang-297x167.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-with-mustang-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-with-mustang-120x68.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-with-mustang-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-with-mustang-1200x675.jpeg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mustang eBike generates 750W of electric boost that can easily accelerate to 28mph (in pedal assist, Class 3 mode with rider pedaling). It also sports the “iconic sequential Mustang taillights.” It has an integrated, one-piece cockpit with a full-color display to display the various ride metrics.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Pony-on-the-Mustang.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Pony-on-the-Mustang.jpeg\" alt=\"Ford Bronco and Mustang eBikes Pony on the Mustang\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Pony-on-the-Mustang.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Pony-on-the-Mustang-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Pony-on-the-Mustang-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Pony-on-the-Mustang-768x576.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s mainly geared to ride on the streets with a pair of semi-slick Pirelli Angle tires and dual suspension. It carries a 48V, 15Ah / 720Wh battery and boasts a claimed range of 60 miles. There are four power modes: Eco, Normal, Sport, and Track. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Mustang-from-the-top-e1723155451132.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"326\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Mustang-from-the-top-e1723155451132.jpeg\" alt=\"Ford Bronco and Mustang eBikes Mustang from the top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Mustang-from-the-top-e1723155451132.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Mustang-from-the-top-e1723155451132-297x121.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Mustang-from-the-top-e1723155451132-120x49.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Mustang-from-the-top-e1723155451132-768x313.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes in Carbonized Gray Metallic, but for a $390 upcharge you can get it in one of 11 different “Ford-Inspired Paintwork” colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comes in sizes: Small, Medium, and Large</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mustang Tech Specs</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Power: 750W* Motor with four modes: Eco, Normal, Sport, and Track</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Class 2: 20MPH** with throttle</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Class 3: 28MPH** without throttle</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weight: 68LBS, Size Medium</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Battery: 48V, 15Ah | 720Wh </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Drivetrain: Shimano Cues U4000, 9-speed, mechanical shifting </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Frame: Aluminium alloy 6061</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Suspension: High-performance air-sprung front suspension fork with 120mm travel and 190x50mm air-sprung rear shock​</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Brakes: Tektro HD E-740 4-piston hydraulic caliper, 203mm front and rear rotors</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wheels &amp; Tires: 27.5” 36H alloy E-MTB wheelset and 2.25″ Pirelli Angel Urban GT tires </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cockpit: Aluminium alloy 6061 integrated handlebar and stem with  full-color display and front light (2000 Lm output, 180 Lux)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lights: Headlight: 2000 Lm Output, 180Lux</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rear Light: Integrated Rear Light</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bronco eBike</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $4500</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The headtube/downtube lines and angles of the Bronco are pretty much identical to the Mustang. The looks of the bike get a little different at the seat and seat tube area, with the Bronco looking a little more equipped for rougher terrain. Ford does say that the Bronco eBike has “got the trail-ready performance to match its off-road heritage”. Also saying that the Bronco is “fully capable and ready for adventure”. Maybe?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-with-Bronco.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1013\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-with-Bronco.jpeg\" alt=\"Ford Bronco and Mustang eBikes with Bronco\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-with-Bronco.jpeg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-with-Bronco-297x167.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-with-Bronco-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-with-Bronco-120x68.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-with-Bronco-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-with-Bronco-1200x675.jpeg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bronco eBike puts out the same 750W of electric boost but also boasts 85Nm of torque. This would be great for those steeper climbs. Ford says that it has “G.O.A.T. (Goes Over Any Type of Terrain) inspired suspension.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-pony-on-the-Bronco.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"558\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-pony-on-the-Bronco.jpeg\" alt=\"Ford Bronco and Mustang eBikes pony on the Bronco\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-pony-on-the-Bronco.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-pony-on-the-Bronco-297x207.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-pony-on-the-Bronco-120x84.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-pony-on-the-Bronco-768x536.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Anywho, the “GOAT-inspired suspension” or “marketing jargon” says it “lets riders maximize the bike’s power by keeping the wheels on the ground over small rocks, while the air-sprung fork and coil rear shock are ready to tackle more challenging terrain” So, basically like every full suspension bike on the market. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing to see here, move along. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Bronco-from-the-rear.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"559\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Bronco-from-the-rear.jpeg\" alt=\"Ford Bronco and Mustang eBikes Bronco from the rear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Bronco-from-the-rear.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Bronco-from-the-rear-297x208.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Bronco-from-the-rear-120x84.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ford-Bronco-and-Mustang-eBikes-Bronco-from-the-rear-768x537.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bronco eBike also has a moto-inspired saddle, which doesn’t appear to be adjustable? Maybe you’ll just be going so fast on the Bronco that you won’t want to sit down as you blast through the whoops with G.O.A.T. suspension. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also comes spec’d with Pirelli Scorpion Enduro M Hardwall tires, helping you to get over the rough stuff. Braking is done by Tektro 4-piston hydraulic disc brakes for good stopping power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, It comes in Area 51 (pictured), but for a $390 upcharge, you can get it in one of 11 different “Ford-Inspired Paintwork” colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comes in one “universal” size. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bronco Tech Specs</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Power: 750W* Motor with four modes: Eco, Trail, Sport, and Baja</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Class 2: 20MPH** with throttle</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Class 3: 28MPH** without throttle</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weight: 67.75LBS</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Battery: 48V, 15Ah | 720Wh </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Drivetrain: Shimano Cues U4000, 9-speed, mechanical shifting </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Frame: Aluminium alloy 6061</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Suspension: High-performance air-sprung front suspension fork with 120mm travel and 190x50mm air-sprung rear shock​</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Brakes: Tektro HD E-740 4-piston hydraulic caliper, 203mm front and rear rotors</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wheels &amp; Tires: 27.5” 36H alloy E-MTB wheelset and 27.5×2.6″ Pirelli Scorpion Enduro M Hardwall tires </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cockpit: Aluminium alloy 6061 integrated handlebar and stem with  full-color display and front light (2000 Lm output, 180 Lux)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lights: Headlight: 2000 Lm Output, 180Lux</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rear Light: Integrated Rear Light</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Both of these bikes are backed by a 2-year warranty. You can buy them online or in person at your local Ford Dealership. Ford says they are easy to assemble and comply with US eBike laws (seems vague). And also, that they are “made to order”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://ford-bikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ford-Bikes.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ford-motors-bronco-mustang-ebikes/\">Ford Motors Releases Bronco and Mustang; Two Odd-Looking eBikes w/Classic Names</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"847578a0b4103373d593bd0da8acebe604784c4af526394ba4f1207d588e5b1d","category":"Cycling"}
