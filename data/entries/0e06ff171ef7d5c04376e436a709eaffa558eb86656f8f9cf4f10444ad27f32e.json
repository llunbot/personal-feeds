Just a few hundred of these killer lightweight road bikes will be built, topped off with a hand-painted finish that Specialized is for some reason labeling ‘Satin Birch with Black Pearl. But there’s no denying that it’s really faux Italian marble!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>S-Works Aethos LTD road bike gets Campagnolo’s best!</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_frameset.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_frameset.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Aethos LTD with Campagnolo Super Record Wireless in faux Italian marble, frame\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_frameset.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_frameset-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_frameset-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_frameset-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_frameset-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_frameset-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_frameset-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Specialized)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With carbon frames as light as 585g, Specialized’s S-Works Aethos ignores aero optimization and overly integrated designs to create a bike too light to race according to the UCI. They call it the ‘<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/585g-specialized-aethos-is-the-newest-worlds-lightest-road-bike-good-luck-catching-it/\" target=\"_blank\">lightest production road bike in the world</a>‘. So, why not give it some ultralight 1240g carbon Campy wheels and the most advanced road bike groupset that Campagnolo has ever produced? As much as this is a ludicrously over-the-top bike build, the S-Works Aethos LTD is a bike begging to be ridden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In 1973 it was a love of riding and Italian craftsmanship that inspired Mike Sinyard to sell his VW bus, pack up his bike, and go ride in Italy. He made it his mission to bring the same Italian craftsmanship to riders in the US, and Specialized Bicycle Components was born.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_Mike-Sinyard-in-the-1970s-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"1858\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_Mike-Sinyard-in-the-1970s-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Aethos LTD with Campagnolo Super Record Wireless in faux Italian marble, Mike Sinyard in the 1970s\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_Mike-Sinyard-in-the-1970s-scaled.jpg 1858w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_Mike-Sinyard-in-the-1970s-218x300.jpg 218w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_Mike-Sinyard-in-the-1970s-800x1102.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_Mike-Sinyard-in-the-1970s-87x120.jpg 87w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_Mike-Sinyard-in-the-1970s-768x1058.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_Mike-Sinyard-in-the-1970s-1115x1536.jpg 1115w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_Mike-Sinyard-in-the-1970s-1487x2048.jpg 1487w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Italy’s the place where people really care about bikes. At the time, that was the best product out there. If you could afford Campy, you’d just get it. There was no question. I look at some of my old Campy bikes, and the stuff is still really good! It was really beautiful, and it still is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sold my Volkswagen before I left for Italy and said, ‘Let me see what I can do!’ The craziest thing was I didn’t really know how to do it. I was staying at this youth hostel. I asked the woman there to help me get a hold of all these companies. She called them up for me and said this American businessman wants to come over. I looked like a bum! So I went to downtown Milan and bought a suit so it would look like I knew what I was doing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then a Swiss woman staying there who spoke Italian said she would go with me. I kind of just made it up! ‘I said I have a company in the US,’ I didn’t have a company! I said I really admired their components. They could tell I was really sincere, and they sold me the products. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was crazy about the Italian components. I read everything about everything. We still have the same fondness for products today.</p>\n<cite><em>– Mike Sinyard, Specialized founder</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Limited edition bike build</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A build kit fit for a king, a pope, or anyone else with deep pockets.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_conventional-lightweight-cockpit.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_conventional-lightweight-cockpit.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Aethos LTD with Campagnolo Super Record Wireless in faux Italian marble, cockpit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_conventional-lightweight-cockpit.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_conventional-lightweight-cockpit-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_conventional-lightweight-cockpit-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_conventional-lightweight-cockpit-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_conventional-lightweight-cockpit-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-S-Works-Aethos-LTD-with-Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-in-faux-Italian-marble_conventional-lightweight-cockpit-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized adorns the featherweight <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/585g-specialized-aethos-is-the-newest-worlds-lightest-road-bike-good-luck-catching-it/\" target=\"_blank\">S-Works Aethos</a> FACT 12r Carbon frameset with a lightweight S-Works Short &amp; Shallow carbon bar.
