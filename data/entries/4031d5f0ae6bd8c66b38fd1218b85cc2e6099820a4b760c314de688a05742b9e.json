Apple said it was told to remove certain apps because of \nnational security concerns, without specifying which. </p>\n\n<p>“We are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we \noperate, even when we disagree,” an Apple spokesperson said. </p>\n\n<p>These messaging apps, which allow users to exchange messages and \nshare files individually and in large groups, combined have around \nthree billion users globally. They can only be accessed in China \nthrough virtual private networks that take users outside China’s \nGreat Firewall, but are still commonly used. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m surprised any of these apps had been available in China until now. Two questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Are these apps still on the iPhones of Chinese people who already had them installed? I don’t recall Apple ever using the kill switch that revokes the developer signing for already-installed copies of apps pulled from the App Store. E.g., iGBA, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/apple-removes-igba-from-app-store/\">the rip-off Nintendo emulator</a> that briefly rocketed to the top of the charts last weekend — pulled from the App Store early this week, but if you installed it while it was available, you can still use it.</p></li>\n<li><p>Do Android phones in China offer sideloading?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> The answer re: sideloading <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193639/huawei-mate-30-google-apps-services-appgallery-p40-preview\">is yes</a>, and both <a href=\"https://signal.org/android/apk/\">Signal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/android\">WhatsApp</a> offer direct downloads of their latest Android builds.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/19/china-app-store-messaging-apps\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4031d5f0ae6bd8c66b38fd1218b85cc2e6099820a4b760c314de688a05742b9e","category":"Tech"}
