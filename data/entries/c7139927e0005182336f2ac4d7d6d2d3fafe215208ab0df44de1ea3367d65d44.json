When you turn around, there’s nobody there. But it’s even worse when you turn around and there is someone there. This can happen with your online life when you have an account hijacked, potentially silently, and parties known or unknown to you are rifling through your data or monitoring you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An Apple ID is no exception. But you can track both principal threats (other devices and logins) and secondary ones (apps and other services) sharing access. You should check which devices and phone numbers are associated with your Apple ID and then do a general audit with Safety Check, introduced in September 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Check for unwanted devices</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To view a list of devices that Apple considers logged in and trusted for your Apple ID account, do one of the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>At the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://appleid.apple.com/&amp;xcust=1-1-2085819-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple ID website</a>, log in and click <em>Devices</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In iOS/iPadOS, go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Account Name</em> and swipe down.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In macOS 13 Ventura or later, go to   &gt; <em>System Settings </em>&gt; <em>Account Name</em> and scroll down.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you see a device you don’t recognize:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Take a screen capture or photo of it in the list, then click or tap on it, and take a screen capture or photo of its information, including its serial number. This may help you if you need to consult a lawyer or law enforcement.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click or tap <em>Remove from Account</em> and confirm its removal.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This device is no longer considered a trusted device for the purposes of logging in to your Apple ID account and can no longer access new information synced via iCloud services. However, it may retain any information that was downloaded or cached locally.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mac911-trusted-devices-icloud-bordered.png?w=1200\" alt=\"iCloud Trusted Devices list\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mac911-trusted-devices-icloud-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1682w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mac911-trusted-devices-icloud-bordered.png?resize=300%2C218&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mac911-trusted-devices-icloud-bordered.png?resize=768%2C558&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mac911-trusted-devices-icloud-bordered.png?resize=1200%2C872&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mac911-trusted-devices-icloud-bordered.png?resize=1536%2C1116&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"872\" /><figcaption><p>Check that you recognize every device logged into your Apple ID account.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Check for unwanted phone numbers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple relies on phone numbers you add during setup or change later to give you additional ways to verify account access if you can’t get to a trusted device or have other account issues. You can check on these trusted numbers; if you don’t recognize a phone number, make screen captures or take photos and make a note. In each of the above places, you can remove an unwanted number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how to find the numbers and remove them:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>At the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://appleid.apple.com/&amp;xcust=1-1-2085819-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple ID website</a>, log in and click <em>Sign-In and Security</em>, and then click <em>Account Security</em>. Trusted phone numbers appear at the top of the list. Click the minus sign to remove a number and click <em>Remove</em> to confirm.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In iOS 17/iPadOS 17, go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Account Name</em> &gt; <em>Sign-In &amp; Security</em> &gt; <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em>. (It appears one level higher in earlier versions of iOS/iPadOS.) Tap <em>Edit</em>, then tap the delete icon, and confirm.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In macOS 13 Ventura, go to <em>System Settings </em>&gt; <em>Account Name</em> &gt; <em>Password/Sign-In &amp; Security</em>; in macOS 14 Sonoma, also click <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em>. Select the number and tap the minus sign at the bottom of the Trusted Phone Numbers section.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mac911-trusted-numbers-mac-bordered.png\" alt=\"Apple trusted numbers\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mac911-trusted-numbers-mac-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 944w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mac911-trusted-numbers-mac-bordered.png?resize=300%2C242&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mac911-trusted-numbers-mac-bordered.png?resize=768%2C618&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"944\" height=\"760\" /><figcaption><p>Trusted phone numbers can verify a log in to your account—dangerous when you don’t recognize the number.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Perform a Safety Check</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting in iOS 16, you can use a new privacy and safety feature called Safety Check. It’s designed to help people who are victims of stalking, intimate partner violence, and similar situations determine whether they are being monitored by or connected to anyone they don’t want to be, and remedy that situation. It also has additional safety pathways built in, as well as advice on contacting real-world resources for help.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mac911-safety-check-ios17-bordered.png?w=769\" alt=\"iOS Safety Check\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mac911-safety-check-ios17-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1183w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mac911-safety-check-ios17-bordered.png?resize=192%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 192w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mac911-safety-check-ios17-bordered.png?resize=768%2C1198&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mac911-safety-check-ios17-bordered.png?resize=769%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 769w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mac911-safety-check-ios17-bordered.png?resize=985%2C1536&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 985w\" width=\"769\" height=\"1199\" /><figcaption><p>Safety Check provides a quick and safety-preserving way to see with whom you’re sharing information or who has access to your location.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Find the feature at <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Privacy &amp; Security</em> &gt; <em>Safety Check</em>.
