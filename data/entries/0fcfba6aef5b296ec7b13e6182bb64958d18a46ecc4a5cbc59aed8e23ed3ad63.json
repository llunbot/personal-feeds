This Ugreen NExode 20,000mAh power bank is not only ready to charge your phone or laptop, but it’s also <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4F34SB4\">$110 right now at Amazon</a> when you apply the $40 coupon on the listing, a serious discount from its $170 MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This power bank can simultaneously charge multiple devices, from smartphones to laptops, tablets, drones, action cameras, and so on. The 20,000mAh capacity is enough to recharge your phone about four times, although it does depend on your phone’s battery capacity. It should also be enough to recharge your laptop at least once. In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2576308/ugreen-nexode-qi2-power-bank-20000-mah-145w-review.html\">4.5-star review</a>, the only thing we didn’t like about the NExode was its high price, which is all but wiped out by this sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the coolest things about this Ugreen model is that it even has a magnetic wireless charger pad at the very top that delivers 15W power, which is perfect for iPhones. The pad tilts so you can still access your phone while charging. There are two charging ports on the front of the power bank—one type-C and one type-A— placed just below the display showing each port’s charging speed. There’s another type-C port on the back, which you can also use to recharge the power bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Place your order for the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4F34SB4\">20,000mAh Ugreen Nexode power bank and get it for $110 at Amazon</a>.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4F34SB4\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0fcfba6aef5b296ec7b13e6182bb64958d18a46ecc4a5cbc59aed8e23ed3ad63","category":"Apple"}
