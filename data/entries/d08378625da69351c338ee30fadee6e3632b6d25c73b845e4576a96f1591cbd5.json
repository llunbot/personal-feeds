Now picture him showing off his athletic footballing brilliance all while balancing on a bike as if the floor is lava. Welcome to the world of Cycle-Ball.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cycle-Ball, also known as <em>radball</em> due to its German origins, was introduced to the world by German-American Nicholas Edward Kaufmann in 1888 and combines both cycling and football. The team with the most goals wins the game. The premise may be simple, but the execution is less so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It takes place indoors on specially designed bikes,’ says Patrick Schnetzer, eight-time World Cycle-Ball champion. ‘People don’t really know that we’re essentially playing while standing on the bike and not sitting. We play 2 vs 2 and the goals are only two metres high and two metres wide. The field is is 14m x 11m and the game lasts seven minutes each way with a two-minute break for half-time.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"592\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/France-play-Germany-in-the-1933-Cycle-Ball-World-Championships-970x592.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/France-play-Germany-in-the-1933-Cycle-Ball-World-Championships-970x592.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/France-play-Germany-in-the-1933-Cycle-Ball-World-Championships-300x183.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/France-play-Germany-in-the-1933-Cycle-Ball-World-Championships-768x469.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/France-play-Germany-in-the-1933-Cycle-Ball-World-Championships-1536x937.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/France-play-Germany-in-the-1933-Cycle-Ball-World-Championships-2048x1250.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/France-play-Germany-in-the-1933-Cycle-Ball-World-Championships-750x458.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/France-play-Germany-in-the-1933-Cycle-Ball-World-Championships-1140x696.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>France play Germany in the 1933 Cycle-Ball World Championships (albeit outside)</figcaption><figcaption>AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cycle-Ball players must constantly balance on fixed-gear bikes. Shooting is allowed with both the front and back wheels, and Schnetzer notes one of the most challenging aspects is the balance. Players cannot step foot on the ground. Should they do so, the player must head behind their own goal line and restart from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Shooting the ball or defending the goal are some of the hardest things to learn. But at some point, when you’ve invested a lot of time and been training so hard, you don’t really think about the bike anymore. It might be demotivating as you don’t see much achievement right from the beginning. It’s not like playing football where you can just kick the ball and go.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"649\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Cycle-Ball-via-UCI-Cycling-2-970x649.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Cycle-Ball-via-UCI-Cycling-2-970x649.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Cycle-Ball-via-UCI-Cycling-2-300x201.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Cycle-Ball-via-UCI-Cycling-2-768x514.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Cycle-Ball-via-UCI-Cycling-2-1536x1028.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Cycle-Ball-via-UCI-Cycling-2-750x502.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Cycle-Ball-via-UCI-Cycling-2-1140x763.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Cycle-Ball-via-UCI-Cycling-2-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Cycle-Ball-via-UCI-Cycling-2-350x233.jpeg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Cycle-Ball-via-UCI-Cycling-2.jpeg 1701w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite only being 29 years old, Schnetzer is one of the most accomplished riders in the niche sport. Introduced to Cycle-Ball by a family friend as a child, his career has flourished from training sessions to gold medals, winning eight of the last 11 World Championships. It’s no surprise that he couldn’t wait to head to Glasgow to participate in the ongoing UCI Cycling World Championships. The first ‘super worlds’ has brought almost every cycling discipline together to host their world championship events over this 11-day period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s very hard to come into the sport if you don’t know anyone who already participates, as it’s not that well known,’ he says. ‘I was really hyped to try it when I was seven and since then, I just couldn’t imagine not playing Cycle-Ball. I would say I was a little bit lucky as when I played my first World Championships in 2010, I was only 16 or 17 years of age. Dietmar Schneider, my teammate at that time, was around 36 years old and had so much experience. I was the lucky guy who got the chance to play with him and then got the chance to play against world class teams when I was young.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A stand-out moment in Schnetzer’s career was his first World Championship title in Japan, 2011. Just weeks before his 18<sup>th</sup> birthday, he was part of the first Austrian team with Schneider to win a championship title and became the youngest world champion in Cycle-Ball history. The sport has developed throughout the years, pace of play higher and equipment being tweaked, but also when it comes to his competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘They are quite a few new countries competing at the World Championships which is great to see. I was part of the project to visit Great Britain last year and held some training sessions with the team to help them develop the sport a little bit. While places like Great Britain are currently still at the beginning of their journeys, hopefully they are really motivated to make it over the upcoming years. It’s always nice to see different countries involved in World Championships as most of the competitions take place in central Europe like Austria, Germany and Switzerland.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"668\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Cycle-Ball-via-UCI-Cycling-970x668.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Cycle-Ball-via-UCI-Cycling-970x668.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Cycle-Ball-via-UCI-Cycling-300x207.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Cycle-Ball-via-UCI-Cycling-768x529.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Cycle-Ball-via-UCI-Cycling-1536x1059.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Cycle-Ball-via-UCI-Cycling-2048x1411.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Cycle-Ball-via-UCI-Cycling-750x517.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Cycle-Ball-via-UCI-Cycling-1140x786.jpeg 1140w\" /><figcaption>UCI Cycling</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Especially as a non-Olympic discipline, it’s fascinating,’  says Schnetzer, ‘as we usually have our championships alongside artistic cycling. You always see the same people and don’t get the chance to meet others from different disciplines. It’s such a big opportunity at Glasgow as a niche sport and I’m really looking forward to experiencing everything. But as soon as you’ve been on the top step of the podium once, you don’t really want to be on one of the runner-up places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s interesting this year as we have the Cycle-Ball ‘A’ group, usually with six teams competing for the world title, and four of those teams have never competed at a World Championship before. They’re motivated as hell, but so are we. I guess it’s also kind of an advantage for them as they don’t have anything to lose and anything can happen.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we head into the closing day of the UCI World Championships, Cycle-Ball medal matches are underway. Austria has just won their bronze medal match against the Czech Republic and Germany will play Switzerland for gold. Schnetzer hopes that more people have been exposed to Cycle-Ball and will give it a try – not just newcomers to cycling, but athletes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I would love more people to give Cycle-Ball a try, even cyclists from other disciplines. The sport is amazing and full of action as the games are quite short. The sport definitely deserves more attention and we’re doing everything to achieve this.’</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycle-ball\">Where cycling meets football: Inside the world of Cycle-Ball</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"d08378625da69351c338ee30fadee6e3632b6d25c73b845e4576a96f1591cbd5","category":"Cycling"}
