This absurdist masterpiece sending up Arthurian legend turns 50 (!) this year.</p>\n<p>It was partly Python member Terry Jones' passion for the Middle Ages and Arthurian legend that inspired <em>Holy Grail</em> and its approach to comedy. (Jones even went on to direct a 2004 documentary, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Jones%27_Medieval_Lives\"><em>Medieval Lives</em></a>.) The troupe members wrote several drafts beginning in 1973, and Jones and Terry Gilliam were co-directors—the first full-length feature for each, so filming was one long learning process. Reviews were mixed when <em>Holy Grail</em> was first released—much like they were for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Frankenstein\"><em>Young Frankenstein</em></a> (1974), another comedic masterpiece—but audiences begged to differ. It was the top-grossing British film screened in the US in 1975. And its reputation has only grown over the ensuing decades.</p>\n<p>The film's broad cultural influence extends beyond the entertainment industry. <span><em>Holy Grail</em> has been the subject of <a href=\"https://www.medievalists.net/2025/04/ten-articles-about-monty-python-and-the-holy-grail/\" target=\"_blank\">multiple scholarly papers</a> examining such topics as its <a href=\"https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/flor/article/view/12509/13435\" target=\"_blank\">effectiveness</a> at teaching Arthurian literature or <a href=\"https://ohiomathjournal.org/index.php/OJSM/article/view/6401\" target=\"_blank\">geometric thought and logic,</a> the <a href=\"https://faculty.winthrop.edu/kosterj/engl510/Readings/dayHolyGrail.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">comedic techniques</a> employed, and why <a href=\"https://usurj.journals.usask.ca/article/view/491\" target=\"_blank\">the depiction</a> of a killer rabbit is so fitting (killer rabbits frequently appear drawn in the margins of Gothic manuscripts).</span> My personal favorite was a <a href=\"https://scispace.com/pdf/could-the-black-knight-have-survived-to-bite-king-arthur-s-3erffwsqaw.pdf\">2018 tongue-in-cheek paper</a> on whether the Black Knight could have survived long enough to make good on his threat to bite King Arthur's legs off (tl;dr: no).</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/monty-python-and-the-holy-grail-turns-50/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/monty-python-and-the-holy-grail-turns-50/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"207d436b175c5cf3bd56d45e61fd705bc47e47d3c5470d2c047e22106b39b765","category":"Tech"}
