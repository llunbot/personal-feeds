{"title":"Apple’s ‘Glowtime’ event is coming on Sept. 9 to introduce iPhone 16 and more","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2438841/apple-glowtime-event-iphone-16-monday-september-9.html","date":1724691356000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s yearly iPhone event always lands in September (that COVID year notwithstanding) and brings us the latest new iPhones, new Apple Watches, and sometimes a surprise or two.  This year, the event comes on September 9 at 10 am Pacific Time. That’s right in line with the usual timing (the second week of September) but Monday is a little unusual; Tuesday and Wednesday are the common days for the iPhone event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tagline pun for this event is “It’s Glowtime,” a seemingly clear reference to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369986/apple-intelligence-siri-features-coming-after-ios-18-launch.html\">new Siri interface</a> that surrounds the entire iPhone screen in a colorful glow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to introduce the iPhone 16 line: iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max. These phones are expected to have two variants of a new A18 processor (A18 and A18 Pro), new colors, ever-so-slightly larger displays on the Pro models, and a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2435899/latest-leak-details-the-iphone-16-lineups-camera-improvements.html\">host of camera improvements</a> including a new Capture button on all models. The big push will be for Apple Intelligence, which will be available for all iPhone 16 models. Of the current iPhones, only the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max will get Apple Intelligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the new iPhones, Apple will introduce the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157474/new-apple-watch-2024-release-date.html\">Apple Watch Series 10 and Ultra 3</a>, and possibly a third-gen version of the Apple Watch SE. The third-gen Ultra isn’t expected to change much, and the third-gen SE is expected to be similar to an Apple Watch Series 8. But the Apple Watch Series 10, sometimes called Apple Watch X, may deliver more substantial changes with a larger display and slimmer, flatter design. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest rumors suggest Apple will <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2430673/airpods-4-with-two-new-models-still-in-apples-2024-plans.html\">introduce new AirPods</a> at this event as well. There are two models expected: A new low-cost AirPods to replace the 2nd-gen AirPods Apple still sells, and a new mid-tier AirPods to replace the 3rd-gen AirPods. The new low-cost model will feature a new design compared to the 2nd-gen AirPods, and the mid-tier model will feature active noise canceling for the first time. Both will have USB-C charging cases. Updated AirPods Max headphones are said to be coming this year as well, but the most recent rumors don’t include them as part of Apple’s September 9 event.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to watch Apple’s Glowtime event</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to watch the Glowtime event, tune in to the usual channels on September 9 at 10 am. You can watch the stream on the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/\">Apple site</a>, in the TV app on every platform that has it, or on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@Apple\">Apple YouTube channel</a>. The invitations are for an in-person event, but the keynote will likely be prerecorded rather than a live on-stage performance</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will embed the YouTube in relevant articles here as well, once it becomes available.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e6e9e813672d81d777eb4a8604c019376e4566ed6b616fa23debe47a1592e912","category":"Apple"}
