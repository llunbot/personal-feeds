New passwords created in Firefox are also saved to ‌iCloud‌ Keychain, which makes them available across Apple devices, plus there is an option to generate verification codes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlongside <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a> 15, Apple introduced a dedicated Passwords app that houses all passwords and logins, making them easier to access and manage. The extension works with the Passwords app in ‌macOS Sequoia‌, but it is also compatible with macOS Sonoma. In macOS Sonoma, passwords and login information are stored in the Passwords section of the Settings app.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/firefox/\">Firefox</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mozilla/\">Mozilla</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/apple-icloud-passwords-firefox-add-on/\">Apple Releases iCloud Passwords Add-On for Firefox</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-icloud-passwords-add-on-for-firefox.2444614/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a4de6bebbda411681924a76502b51d4a2467111d95cb5b5840b3806f2bc60166","category":"Apple"}
