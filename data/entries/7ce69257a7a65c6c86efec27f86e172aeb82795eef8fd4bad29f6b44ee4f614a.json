The account <a href=\"https://apply.applecard.apple/?utm_content=savings\">currently offers a 4.15% APY</a>, a rate Apple said was \"more than 10 times the national average\" as of late March. The account can be set up and completely managed in the Wallet app on the iPhone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Forbes</em> this week reported that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/01/apple-card-savings-account-deposits/\">around 240,000 Apple Card savings accounts</a> were opened in the first week, citing sources familiar with the matter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points on Wednesday, but the Apple Card savings account's APY remains unchanged for now. It's unclear if or when Goldman Sachs will increase the account's APY in response to the rate hike, as many other banks offering high-yield savings accounts commonly do.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's credit card and the savings account are available in the U.S. only.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/05/tim-cook-touts-apple-card-savings/\">Tim Cook Touts 'Incredible' Response to Apple Card Savings Account on iPhone</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tim-cook-touts-incredible-response-to-apple-card-savings-account-on-iphone.2388797/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7ce69257a7a65c6c86efec27f86e172aeb82795eef8fd4bad29f6b44ee4f614a","category":"Apple"}
