While “traditions” usually conjure up thoughts of centuries-old practices, some are a bit more modern, like the watching of holiday Peanuts specials on TV. The first of several holiday-themed episodes, <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/its-the-great-pumpkin-charlie-brown/umc.cmc.1c5nvp802hos5t3u0umlukkwh\"><em>It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown</em></a>, is a Halloween classic that’s exclusively on Apple TV+.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Apple has allowed PBS to air the special in previous years, that’s not the case anymore. Hold on though, there’s no need to get mad and start smashing pumpkins<em>–yes, I’m talking about you, Uncle Fred</em>. If you don’t subscribe to Apple TV+, you’ll still be able to partake in this great tradition, because Apple is making <em>Great Pumpkin</em> available for free to watch for a weekend. And those who currently subscribe to Apple TV+ can watch <em>Great Pumpkin</em> at any time, even in February if that suits you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to watch <em>Great Pumpkin</em> for free on Apple TV+</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From October 19 to 20, anyone with an Apple ID (free to sign up) can watch <em>It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown</em>.
