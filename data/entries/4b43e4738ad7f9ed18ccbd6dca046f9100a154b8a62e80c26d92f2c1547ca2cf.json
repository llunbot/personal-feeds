While many shoes use a traditional ‘U-throat’ (a U-shaped cutout in the upper that cinches together over a tongue), PerformFit Wrap shoes instead pull material from one side of the shoe to the other. This method of pulling back and down instead of trying to minimize volume with a U-throat is claimed to result in a more secure fit without as much pressure, resulting in a more comfortable, higher-performance fit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to BOA, this is the first PerformFit Wrap on a DH flat pedal shoe. It’s also available in a clipless model, allowing it to take advantage of the increased pedaling efficiency. Using a single BOA Li2 dial and a low-friction TX4 lace, the PeformFit Wrap is split into three main sections that allow it to conform over the top of the foot. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-01.png\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-01-1536x1536.png\" alt=\"Tallac Mid mountain bike shoe with BOA PerformFit Wrap\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-01-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-01-297x297.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-01-120x120.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-01-768x768.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-01.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-03.png\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-03-1536x1536.png\" alt=\"Tallac Mid mountain bike shoe with BOA PerformFit Wrap\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-03-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-03-297x297.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-03-120x120.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-03-768x768.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-03.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-06.png\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-06-1536x1536.png\" alt=\"Tallac Mid mountain bike shoe with BOA PerformFit Wrap\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-06-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-06-297x297.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-06-120x120.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-06-768x768.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-06.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-05.png\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-05-1536x1536.png\" alt=\"Tallac Mid mountain bike shoe with BOA PerformFit Wrap\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-05-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-05-297x297.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-05-120x120.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-05-768x768.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tallac-MID_Black-05.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That performance fit is then combined with a mid-height collar and plenty of D3O to make this a very protective shoe for both riders and trail builders. In addition to the D3O shock-absorbing material on the ankle collar, you’ll also find it in the PerformFit Wrap itself to provide impact protection to the top of the foot. It’s also used in the insole to mute harsh impacts on landing. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-22-at-10.32.11 AM.png\"><img width=\"969\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-22-at-10.32.11 AM.png\" alt=\"Ride Concepts Tallac Mid outsole flat clip\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-22-at-10.32.11 AM.png 969w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-22-at-10.32.11 AM-297x215.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-22-at-10.32.11 AM-120x87.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-22-at-10.32.11 AM-768x555.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Underneath, you’ll find a Hexagon outsole with reverse hex traction on the toe and heel for hike-a-bikes and trail-building sessions. The Clip Grip sole is a bit stiffer than the Max Grip sole for flat pedals, and both models are considered a medium volume shoe. In our experience, the samples we tried were really more of a medium to high volume shoe, which also seemed to fit at least a half-size larger than previous Ride Concepts shoes. The difference in fit was great enough that we didn’t get to try out the Tallac Mid, but we have a smaller sample on the way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Features (Flat)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>PerformFit™ Wrap from the BOA® Fit System delivers dialed-in performance with micro-adjustable precision fit</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Integrated D3O® pads for top-of-foot protection</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3D-molded D3O® collar protects ankles from side impacts</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MaxGrip rubber outsole </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hexagon outsole featuring reverse hex traction pattern on toe and heel for hike-able climbs and descents</li>\n\n\n\n<li>EVA midsole provides support and shock absorption</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fully gusseted tongue prohibits the intake of dirt and debris</li>\n\n\n\n<li>D3O® High Impact Zone Technology insole absorbs impact and reduces fatigue</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lightweight bonded upper featuring Cordura® mesh for durability and breathability</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Anti-bacterial mesh lining controls odor</li>\n\n\n\n<li>TPU mudguard to protect against dirt, debris, and rubbing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>TPU toe and heel protection with reinforced anti-abrasion film</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Heel pull tab for easy entry</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weights: 440g (per shoe – size US9/EU42)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Features (Clip)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>PerformFit™ Wrap from the BOA® Fit System delivers dialed-in performance with micro-adjustable precision fit</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Integrated D3O® pads for top-of-foot protection</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3D-molded D3O® collar protects ankles from side impacts</li>\n\n\n\n<li>ClipGrip rubber outsole </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hexagon outsole featuring reverse hex traction pattern on toe and heel for hike-able climbs and descents</li>\n\n\n\n<li>EVA midsole provides support and shock absorption</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fully gusseted tongue prohibits the intake of dirt and debris</li>\n\n\n\n<li>D3O® High Impact Zone Technology insole absorbs impact and reduces fatigue</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lightweight bonded upper featuring Cordura® mesh for durability and breathability</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Anti-bacterial mesh lining controls odor</li>\n\n\n\n<li>TPU mudguard to protect against dirt, debris, and rubbing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>TPU toe and heel protection with reinforced anti-abrasion film</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Heel pull tab for easy entry</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weights: 530g (per shoe – size US9/EU42)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tallac Mid is available now for $220 for the Flat version and $230 for the Clip version.
