{"title":"Keyboard Maestro 11","link":"https://wiki.keyboardmaestro.com/manual/Whats_New","date":1710957821000,"content":"\n<p>Another recent-ish update to one of my essential Mac utilities:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Keyboard Maestro 11 expands on the powerful base of previous \nversions, improving the editor, adding many new actions and \ntriggers, New Macro Wizard, a new Security preference pane, a \n<code>keyboardmaestro</code> command line tool, support for Apple Text \nRecognition, and more. Keyboard Maestro 11 requires macOS 10.13 \nHigh Sierra or later. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My number one tip for anyone looking to up their Mac power-user game is to get Keyboard Maestro. It’s like having super powers. $36 for a new license, $25 to upgrade. And of course there’s a free trial.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/20/keyboard-maestro-11\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a2ee99a0626861f7f8a5e7ee996c7e7ed5824196475ae4bf9abf3559e7d25792","category":"Tech"}
