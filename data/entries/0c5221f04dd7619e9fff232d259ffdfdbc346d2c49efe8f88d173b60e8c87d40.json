title=\"Rondo Ruut V2 at Eurobike\" />                                            <p>Rondo has revealed its updated Ruut V2, featuring a compliance zone in the seat tube and updated geometry.</p>\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bike</a> has been designed around a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-650b/\">650b wheel</a> size and uses the brand’s Twin Tip fork that enables the head angle to be changed between slack and steep settings.</p>\n<p>Rondo has yet to set a release date for the new Ruut, though more models are expected to be announced later in the year.</p>\n<h2>Compliance zone</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\"

compliance.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The release of the new Ruut doesn’t come as a shock, after images were teased of the new frame <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/rondo-ruut-v2/\">back in February</a>.</p>\n<p>A key difference compared to the old frame is the polygon area situated around the bottom of the seat tube, which is said to aid vertical compliance by enabling the rear triangle to flex similarly to a leaf spring.</p>\n<p>While not identical, the new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/specialized-sirrus-future-of-bike-design/\">Specialized Sirrus</a> features a similar compliance zone.</p>\n<p>Rondo has yet to divulge details on how the compliance zone functions, though more information is expected in the coming days.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rondo Ruut V2 at Eurobike\" title=\"Rondo Ruut V2 at Eurobike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Rondo has followed the trend of headset internal cable routing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The new Ruut features full internal cable routing that enters the frame through the Acros headset, with Rondo’s own stem required to feed the cables into.</p>\n<p>Rondo says it has designed the front and bottom part of the frame to be solid and tight in order to keep a racy nature to the Ruut, and to maintain the bike’s handling dynamic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/sram-udh/\">SRAM’s Universal Derailleur Hanger</a> is also specced, opening up possible mullet drivetrain options in the future.</p>\n<div>\n    <img

bracket</a> is now an asymmetric T47 standard, which the brand says solves the problem some riders had when fitting <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-power-meters/\">power meters</a>.</p>\n<p>Rondo has slackened the head angle of the Ruut by 0.5 degrees, down from 71.5 degrees to 71 degrees on bikes sized medium and above in the low setting of the Twin Tip fork.</p>\n<p>The Small remains at 70.5 degrees in the low setting.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rondo Ruut V2 at Eurobike\" title=\"Rondo Ruut V2 at Eurobike\"

the CF0, which gets Force Etap AXS.</p>\n<p>The top-end Ruut CF0 also features Hunt Limitless Gravel CF wheels wrapped in Pirelli Cinturato Gravel H tyres.</p>","author":"Nick
