A lot is going on this weekâ€”of course it seems like there's always a lot going on in space these days. However, it's notable that Virgin Galactic is resuming ticket sales at a much higher price point. And then there's that exclusive story I had on Blue Origin's BE-4 engine delays. I'm excited for Astra's next launch attempt, too.</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site).
