The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1948425/mac-studio-m2-max-review.html\">Mac Studio</a> is alarmingly good for much cheaper. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, too, bought into the critique of the Mac Pro being a bad buy. But the Mac Pro does have value–a lot of it. As a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2173604/2019-intel-mac-pro-apple-silicon-storage-speed-graphics.html\">fan of the 2019 Intel Mac Pro</a>, I tried the M2 Max MacBook Pro and Mac Studio but found that the Mac Pro has advantages that can’t be overlooked.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hidden costs of other Macs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When I tried to switch over to a MacBook Pro as my primary Mac, the problems started almost immediately as I attempted to mimic the hefty storage and port options that I had on my 2019 Mac Pro. I need more than the three Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports on the MacBook Pro so I required a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668894/best-thunderbolt-3-4-and-usb-c-docking-stations-for-macbook-pro-and-air.html\">Thunderbolt dock</a>. The Mac Studio has more ports, so I fared better with it, but I still needed a Sonnet Thunderbolt 4 Dock to support all the external devices I use. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cost savings of the Mac Studio quickly start to dwindle when accounting for the expense of the external devices needed. There’s the hub, all the cables needed to connect to the hub, and the enclosures I had to buy to house the items that were internally installed in my Mac Pro. If no enclosure was available, I had to buy external replacements. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-studio-external-drives.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Mac Studio external drives\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-studio-external-drives.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-studio-external-drives.jpg?resize=300%2C146&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-studio-external-drives.jpg?resize=768%2C374&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-studio-external-drives.jpg?resize=1200%2C585&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-studio-external-drives.jpg?resize=1536%2C749&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-studio-external-drives.jpg?resize=2048%2C998&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"585\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The Mac Studio may be as fast as the Mac Pro, but it comes with a few extra friends on your desk.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Thiago Trevisan/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Those external replacements are where it really hits your wallet and the cost benefit of the Mac Studio shrinks substantially. More affordable USB-C external drives do not play nicely with Macs–USB performance is capped at lower speeds due to Macs not supporting USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 speeds. You’ll be limited to USB 3.1 Gen 2 speeds of about 10Gbps, roughly half the theoretical speed on a PC with the same drive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means that if you want faster performance, you must opt for more expensive Thunderbolt 4 external drives that can offer up to 40Gbps. (I cover the performance issues later in this article.)</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-studio-sonnet-dock.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Mac Studio Sonnet Dock\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-studio-sonnet-dock.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-studio-sonnet-dock.jpg?resize=300%2C130&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-studio-sonnet-dock.jpg?resize=768%2C333&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-studio-sonnet-dock.jpg?resize=1200%2C520&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-studio-sonnet-dock.jpg?resize=1536%2C666&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-studio-sonnet-dock.jpg?resize=2048%2C887&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"520\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>You’ll likely need a Thunderbolt Dock to support more devices without a Mac Pro.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Thiago Trevisan/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, if you’re not a previous Mac Pro user and you’re upgrading from an older MacBook Pro or a desktop Mac and already have an external device setup, your expense for setting up may be limited.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Clutter- and noise-free (mostly)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mac Studio and MacBook Pro may not occupy a lot of space, but they need a symphony of devices to replicate the capabilities of the Mac Pro on a desk.

You can daisy chain Thunderbolt devices to each other, but you will always have a large cacophony of cables–most external devices need at least a power cable and their own Thunderbolt connection. Think of the Mac Pro like a large skyscraper, fitting most of these devices internally and vertically–no cable mess. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mac Studio and MacBook Pro are silent machines, but the accompanying external devices can remove that magic because of their noisy fans for cooling. Most external Thunderbolt enclosures come packed with fans–I have chased down <a href=\"https://noctua.at/\">Noctua</a> fans to replace the stock fans in some external enclosures, adding to both cost and wasted time in trying to make a less-noisy workstation setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Mac Pro, the large fans keep PCIe cards cool, and you rarely hear even a whimper from this elegant cheese-grater masterpiece.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-studio-clutter.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Mac Pro clutter\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-studio-clutter.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-studio-clutter.jpg?resize=300%2C163&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-studio-clutter.jpg?resize=768%2C417&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-studio-clutter.jpg?resize=1200%2C652&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-studio-clutter.jpg?resize=1536%2C835&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-studio-clutter.jpg?resize=2048%2C1113&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"652\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Cables quickly add up across needed devices.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p>Thiago Trevisan/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Appreciating PCIe</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t have to be an audio engineer or YouTuber to benefit from the Mac Pro’s PCIe slots. You can skip many external Thunderbolt devices and use an internal PCIe-compatible option, instead. The Mac Pro has six PCIe gen 4 slots–it’s enough to free up the Mac Pro’s external ports, and suddenly the need for a pricey Thunderbolt 4 dock goes away. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pcie-cards.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"PCIe cards\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pcie-cards.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pcie-cards.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pcie-cards.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pcie-cards.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pcie-cards.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pcie-cards.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pcie-cards.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pcie-cards.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Beefy heatsinks on PCIe cards equates to silence, with only the Mac Pro fans needed.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Thiago Trevisan/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A minor win for the Mac Pro is that its internal Apple SSDs are upgradable, whereas the Mac Studio’s are not. If you bought 1TB and later want 8TB, you can have it. You may want to add PCIe cards for a better price-to-performance ratio, but the option is there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do need to connect external devices, the Mac Pro has eight Thunderbolt 4 ports and two USB-A ports. It also has two HDMI ports, two gigabit-ethernet ports, and a 3.5mm audio jack. You won’t need to buy a dock.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-pro-internals.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Mac Pro internal\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-pro-internals.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-pro-internals.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-pro-internals.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-pro-internals.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-pro-internals.jpg?resize=1200%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-pro-internals.jpg?resize=1536%2C1536&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-pro-internals.jpg?resize=2048%2C2048&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac-pro-internals.jpg?resize=1240%2C1240&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The Mac Pro has six PCIe slots.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Thiago Trevisan/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you only need a few terabytes of storage that can be accomplished with a simple external SSD and no PCIe cards, then the Mac Pro has no real benefit to you.

All of this comes in a silent package that relies on the fans of the Mac Pro to quietly keep it cool.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sonnet-raid-0-disk-speed-test.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1154\" alt=\"Mac Pro Sonnet raid 0 disk speed test\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sonnet-raid-0-disk-speed-test.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sonnet-raid-0-disk-speed-test.jpg?resize=289%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 289w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sonnet-raid-0-disk-speed-test.jpg?resize=768%2C798&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sonnet-raid-0-disk-speed-test.jpg?resize=1154%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1154w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sonnet-raid-0-disk-speed-test.jpg?resize=1478%2C1536&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1478w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sonnet-raid-0-disk-speed-test.jpg?resize=1970%2C2048&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1970w\" width=\"1154\" height=\"1200\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Blackmagicdesign’s Disk Speed Test benchmark of four Samsung 970 EVO Plus NVMe SSDs in a Raid 0 array on a Sonnet PCIe card. </p></figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Even a more mundane PCIe Gen 3 raid 0 of four Samsung 970 EVO NVMe SSDs results in an impressive 12,632MBps write and 9,634MBps read. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.owc.com/solutions/accelsior-4m2\">OWC Accelsior 4M2</a> NVMe RAID 0 array with four Samsung 980 Pros installed in an 8x lane on the Mac Pro still reached 6,622MBps write and 5,558MBps read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want SSD and hard drive raid arrays for backup?

Everything below works and is visible in macOS when installed. I simply moved it over from my new Mac Pro and it all worked–that’s a big bonus. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Sonnet 4×4 NVME PCIe card in the bottom 16x lane</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sonnet 8×4 NVME PCIe card in the top 16x lane </li>\n\n\n\n<li>OWC Accelsior 4M2 NVME PCIe card in an 8x lane</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sonnet Fusion SSD PCIe card in 8x lane number 6 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple supplied I/O Card in the top slot </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The PCIe lanes are shared and limited so you cannot use them all at once and expect uncompromised performance. I use multiple large arrays for sequential backups (such as with Time Machine), so drops in theoretical speed are acceptable. They’re still faster than any external Thunderbolt drive.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/macos-expansion-slot-utility.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"macOS expansion slot utility\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/macos-expansion-slot-utility.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/macos-expansion-slot-utility.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/macos-expansion-slot-utility.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/macos-expansion-slot-utility.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/macos-expansion-slot-utility.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/macos-expansion-slot-utility.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/macos-expansion-slot-utility.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/macos-expansion-slot-utility.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>It looks scary, but it still works and automatically adjusts bandwidth.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The built-in Expansion Slot Utility in macOS shows my Pool A Allocation at a whopping 181 percent, and Pool B at 59 percent. It dynamically adjusts bandwidth between each pool for the best performance. You can also manually assign different PCIe cards to different Pools, but I found that keeping it the “Automatic Bandwidth Configuration” worked best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may look scary, but it all functions fine, just with reduced speeds if you attempt to use more than one lane at a time. The 2019 Intel Mac Pro had a more generous allotment of bandwidth, but it also had to accommodate lane-hungry GPUs in its 16x slots, such as the Radeon W6800X Duo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2019 Mac Pro also only supported PCIe Gen 3; the 2023 Mac Pro supports Gen 4 speeds. This helps to balance some of the bandwidth differences, but the limits remain on Apple silicon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thunderbolt connectivity is independent now with this Apple silicon Mac Pro, whereas in the 2019 Mac Pro Thunderbolt also shared available bandwidth. That is why I keep at least a single Thunderbolt SanDisk Pro-Blade Station with four NVMe drives, to balance the internal PCIe slots bandwidth out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even 2.5-inch SSD drives can be added to a Mac Pro. With the <a href=\"https://www.sonnettech.com/product/fusion-flex-j3i/overview.html\">Sonnet J3i</a> or <a href=\"https://www.promise.com/us/Products/Pegasus/R4i-J2i\">Promise Pegasus J2i</a>, it is a simple drop-in upgrade. Hard drives with massive amounts of storage are likewise easy to add. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sonnet-fusion.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Sonnet Fusion card\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sonnet-fusion.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sonnet-fusion.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sonnet-fusion.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sonnet-fusion.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sonnet-fusion.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sonnet-fusion.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sonnet-fusion.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sonnet-fusion.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Some PCIe cards, such as this Sonnet Fusion card with two WD Blue SSDs, must be used in specific PCIe slots.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Thiago Trevisan/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.sonnettech.com/product/fusion-dual-ssd-raid/overview.html\">Sonnet Fusion Dual 2.5-inch SSD RAID card</a> works but only in the number 6 8x PCIe in the 2023 Mac Pro. (This is noted by Sonnet, who guides users to install it in this specific slot only for this Fusion card.) It played nicely with the other installed NVMe PCIe cards in both the 16x and 8x slots.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don’t overlook the Mac Pro</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On paper, the Mac Pro seems like a bad deal. But for users who need tons of storage, it’s a sleeper pick. Adding PCIe cards is still cheaper per terabyte than adding external Thunderbolt solutions. You’ll appreciate the noise reduction, the practicality, and the fast performance that fits neatly inside a Mac Pro. The Mac Pro is an excellent combination of power and beautiful design.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e001c5b22a8376bc429f5678f9bc6e262e68e013cf092b6930ee1827f956ed7f","category":"Apple"}
