But the new concept, revealed this morning at IAA Mobility, explores idea which the company says will inform that electric vehicle, due in 2025.</p>\n<p>Not so much in the way it looks, which is a shame since this compact one-box shape—described by a fellow journalist as a Cyber Twingo—is a refreshing break from oversized SUVs. Instead, it's the car's approach to sustainability that BMW is running with—\"Circular\" refers to the car's lifecycle, which aims to use entirely recycled materials resulting in a vehicle that is entirely recyclable too. Currently, BMW says that across its brands (which include Mini and Rolls-Royce), it's already at 30 percent recycled and reused materials.</p>\n<p>\"The BMW i Vision Circular illustrates our all-encompassing, meticulous way of thinking when it comes to sustainable mobility. It symbolises our ambition to be a pioneering force in the development of a circular economy,\" said BMW Chairman Oliver Zipse. \"We lead the way for resource efficiency in production and we are seeking to extend this status to all stages of the vehicle life cycle. This is a question of economic sustainability too, as the current trend in commodity prices clearly shows the financial consequences in store for any industry that is reliant on finite resources.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792295#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792295&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
