The boosted values are good until April 2 in the U.S., U.K., and Canada.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the boosted Mac credit values and the previous ones (U.S./U.K./Canada):</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>MacBook Pro</strong>: Up to $925/£715/CA$1,125 (previously $915/£705/CA$935)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>MacBook Air</strong>: Up to $435/£325/CA$450 (previously $425/£325/$440)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>MacBook</strong>: Up to $140/£100/CA$160 (previously $90/£70/CA$90)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iMac</strong>: Up to $315/£250/CA$380 (previously $305/£240/CA$370)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iMac Pro</strong>: Up to $455/£330/CA$545 (previously $405/£300/CA$500)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mac mini</strong>: Up to $375/£260/CA$215 (previously $365/£250/CA$225)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mac Studio</strong>: Up to $1,150/£820/CA$920 (previously $1,140/£835/CA$995)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mac Pro</strong>: Up to $720/£535/CA$640 ($670/ £530/CA$585)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The credit value is determined by the condition and age of the Mac. The most recent Mac models in the best condition will get the highest payouts, and Macs that are too old or damaged may not be eligible (though Apple will happily recycle it for free). Apple’s Trade In website has a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/trade-in\">short form</a> to get an estimation of credit, though you’ll need your Mac’s serial number. To take advantage of the limited-time offer, here’s what you need to do to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/545062/mac-sell-trade-apple-store-online.html\">get your Mac ready for a trade-in</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676245/how-apple-trade-in-works-and-saves-you-money.html\">Trade In program</a> is an easy way to get rid of your old Mac, but you can often get more if you sell privately or use a different program. Here are the details on <a href=\"http://How%20to%20sell%20a%20Mac%20or%20MacBook\">how to sell a Mac or MacBook</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to announce a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">M4 MacBook Air</a> in the next few weeks, so this limited offer could be a signal that it’s coming in March.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3542de091b852f6d4097eee4d7078b65fd80154dc557ad98ba910950b77a06fb","category":"Apple"}
