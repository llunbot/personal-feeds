Plus mudguards not only protect your fellow riders from road spray but also protect parts of your bike from grit and dirt, extending component lifespan, and that is cool!</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sks-speedrocker-mudguards-review\" target=\"_blank\">SKS Speedrocker mudguards review</a> (as shown above)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Alternatively, read our complete guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-bicycle-mudguards\" target=\"_blank\">best mudguards for road bikes</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A full-length set of mudguards will work best, saving you and your kit from excess wear.

There are plenty of options out there in regards to winter tyres but one set that have consistently impressed the team here at <em>Cyclist</em> are these Schwalbe One TLE models. They’re not cheap, but they’re likely to be long-lasting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus you can <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-fit-tubeless-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">set them up tubeless</a>: rolling with a generous squirt of sealant inside, they’ll be able to seal most punctures before you even know they’re there.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/schwalbe-one-tle-raceguard-tyres-review\" target=\"_blank\">Schwalbe One TLE tyres review here</a> </strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Head over to our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-winter-road-bike-tyres-stay-puncture-free\" target=\"_blank\">complete guide to winter tyres here</a> </strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>They aren’t too heavy, so there’s still some joy to be had from them. Get them in a wide size – frame permitting – and you’ll be ready to roll through the worst winter conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://fave.co/3tO7Q7p\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Buy the Continental GP5000 AS TR tubeless tyre from Merlin Cycles for £59.99</strong></a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Get some lights</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/10/02115724/red-bull-timelaps-riders-night-970x712.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you don’t plan on staying out after dark, the clocks changing make it increasingly likely you’ll find yourself caught out at some point. All you need is a heavy rain cloud to roll over and it will quickly feel as if you’re riding at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as not having lights after sunset is both dangerous and illegal, it makes sense to leave a set permanently attached to your bike over the winter and, at the very least, a solitary rear light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s near endless choice when it comes to lights, but we’re big fans of the Lezyne Hecto Drive 500XL/Strip Drive Light Set.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/10/02115727/lezyne_hecto_drive_500xlstrip_drive_light_set-970x968.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Its front light pumps out a claimed 500 lumens from a very neat package and will last up to 20 hours on the lowest setting.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-winter-bike-lights\" target=\"_blank\">buyers guide to the best winter bike lights</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Equally quick to attach and compatible with aero-seat posts, the Strip Drive’s five LEDs sit in an IPX7 waterproof case. Offering up to 270° of visibility and a 150-lumen output, it will ensure you get seen by any cars approaching from behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s even bright enough to use as a daytime running light – perfect for gloomy mornings or when riding into low winter sunshine.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong> <a href=\"https://tidd.ly/40mtWdr\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the Lezyne Hecto Drive 500XL from Tredz for £38</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Stay on top of cleaning</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, grim weather will make your bike accumulate dirt quicker. This means it’s important to clean it regularly. Salt from the road can be a particular killer, so after each wet ride, try to at least give it a quick hose down, followed by treatment with some water-dispersant spray and a quick re-lube of the chain.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-wash-a-bike-the-pro-way\" target=\"_blank\">full guide to cleaning and detailing your bike here</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>You can <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/watch-how-to-clean-a-road-bike-in-the-time-it-takes-to-make-a-cup-of-tea\" target=\"_blank\">clean a bike quicker than you can make a cup of tea</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This will help everything last longer and avoid rust. A nicely polished bike will also be more inclined to shed dirt the next time it’s ridden too. Clean bikes are also fast bikes, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/10/02115734/gifts_budget_9_muc_off_8_in_1-970x661.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A set like Muc-Off’s 8-in-1 bicycle cleaning kit includes all the brushes you might need, plus bike-specific cleaning fluid and finishing spray. The only other bits you’ll need is a few extra some sponges, a rag and maybe a set of Marigolds to prevent bike grease getting on your hands – it can be a nightmare to get off.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy the Muc-Off 8-in-1 cleaning kit from </strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/49HjzFi\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Amazon (£34.99</strong>)</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Tredz version for <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6821&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;clickref=prepare+your+bike+for+winter+cycling+tredz+cleaning+kit&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tredz.co.uk%2F.Tredz-8-Piece-Cleaning-Bucket-Set_262286.htm%3Fsku%3D944410\" target=\"_blank\">£23.30 (RRP £34.99)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Bag yourself some bags</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap4-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Restrap Canister handlebar bag\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap4-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap4-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap4-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap4-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap4-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap4.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Matt Buckley / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you do go tubeless, punctures are more likely in winter as the rain washes all kinds of things onto the side of the road, where they’re primed to bring misery. You need to make sure you can carry the spares you need comfortably, without overloading your pockets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While saddle bags remain popular, we’re big fans of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/an-introduction-to-bikepacking\" target=\"_blank\">bikepacking</a>-style luggage too. Originally designed for bikepackers and ultracyclists to carry around kit on their adventures, the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-bikepacking-bags\" target=\"_blank\">best bikepacking bags</a> can be a great option for regular cyclists on single-day rides too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most popular option currently is the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-handlebar-bag\" target=\"_blank\">bar bag</a> which can be seen on every single bike rolling out of south London on a Saturday and Sunday morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For short to medium length winter rides, something like the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/restrap-canister-handlebar-bag-review\" target=\"_blank\">Restrap Canister bar bag</a> is ideal. </p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Keep an eye on your cables…</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/10/02115741/cable-970x602.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s amazing how far water and dirt can penetrate your bike during a wet, muddy ride. Even sealed-in components such as brake and gear cables can suffer after a good soaking, affecting your ability to stop or shift in a timely fashion.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Learn <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/the-importance-of-cables-and-how-to-fit-them\" target=\"_blank\">how to fit new brake and gear cables</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://fave.co/3FGAeer\" target=\"_blank\">Buy gear cables from Wiggle from £2.49</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>7. And your drivetrain…</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/10/02115744/chain_cleaners-970x711.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Your bike’s drivetrain will suffer more in the winter. Whether from rain or salt on the road, it’ll both get muckier and dry out quicker. One solution is to change to a thicker ‘wet’ condition chain lube such as <a href=\"https://fave.co/46TzjU1\" target=\"_blank\">Muc-Off Wet Lube</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this can work if you’re lazy, doing so will soon see your drivetrain get black and gunky. A better solution is to clean regularly with a dedicated chain cleaning device and simply apply your regular lube a bit more frequently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the bunch we group tested, the Pedro’s Chain Pig Machine II won our vote, largely by dint of looking like a little pink pig.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://fave.co/46TzjU1\" target=\"_blank\">Buy Muc-Off Wet Lube from Wiggle for £7.19</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/how-to-prepare-your-bike-for-winter-cycling\">How to prepare your bike for winter cycling</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"jgibbons","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"a30fd1fd2c517e271c34bfb66ec9d9f3f177f5101daa576ca04e652ed8eec3bd","category":"Cycling"}
