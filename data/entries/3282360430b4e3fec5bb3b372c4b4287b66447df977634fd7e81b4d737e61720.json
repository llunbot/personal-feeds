A <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/13/mozilla-downsizes-as-it-refocuses-on-firefox-and-ai-read-the-memo/\">TechCrunch</a> report has a company memo that followed these layoffs, detailing one product shutdown and a \"scaling back\" of a few others.</p>\n<p>Mozilla started as the open source browser/email company that rose from the ashes of Netscape. Firefox and Thunderbird have kept on trucking since then, but the <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/\">mozilla.org/products</a> page is a great example of what the strategy has been lately: \"Firefox is just the beginning!\" reads the very top of the page; it then goes on to detail a lot of projects that aren't in line with Mozilla's core work of making a browser. There's Mozilla Monitor (a data breach checker), Mozilla VPN, Pocket (a news reader app), Firefox Relay (for making burner email accounts), and Firefox Focus, a fork of Firefox with a privacy focus.</p>\n<p>That's not even a comprehensive list of recent Mozilla products. From 2017–2020, there was \"Firefox Send,\" an encrypted file transfer service, and a VR-focused \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/02/mozilla-apparently-makes-and-is-discontinuing-a-vr-version-of-firefox/\">Firefox Reality</a>\" browser that lasted from 2018 to 2022. In 2022, Mozilla launched a $35 million venture capital fund called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/02/mozilla-launches-35m-venture-capital-fund-for-early-stage-responsible-startups/\">Mozilla Ventures</a>. Not all Mozilla side-projects are losers—the memory-safe Rust programming language was spun out of Mozilla in 2020 and has seen rapid adoption in the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/linus-torvalds-weighs-in-on-rust-language-in-the-linux-kernel/\">Linux kernel</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/google-is-now-writing-low-level-android-code-in-rust/\">Android</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003285#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003285&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3282360430b4e3fec5bb3b372c4b4287b66447df977634fd7e81b4d737e61720","category":"Tech"}
