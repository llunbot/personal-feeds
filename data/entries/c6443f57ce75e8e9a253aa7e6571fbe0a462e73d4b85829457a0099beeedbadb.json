Netflix Games, included with a Netflix subscription, allows users to play a handful of games on their mobile devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/netflix-games-launch.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAvailable gaming titles include \"Stranger Things: 1984,\" \"Stranger Things 3: The Game,\" \"Shooting Hoops,\" \"Card Blast,\" and \"Teeter Up.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccessing games on Netflix requires a Netflix subscription, and there are no ads, additional fees, or in-app purchases, which is how Apple's gaming service, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/\">Apple Arcade</a>, operates. Netflix is releasing each game as an individual app on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> while allowing users to see the full catalog of games in the Netflix app, which is well within Apple's ‌App Store‌ rules for gaming subscription services.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Netflix Games is coming to iOS!
