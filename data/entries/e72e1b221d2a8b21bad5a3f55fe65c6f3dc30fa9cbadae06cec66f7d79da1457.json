He left behind decades of innovation, piles of tires, and other remnants from his lifelong pursuit of making.</p>\n<p>Gordon was an OG. I think he’d appreciate that term. He was an Original Gangster of the North American framebuilding world, learning the art form from the great Albert Eisentraut. Bruce picked up the torch in the very first framebuilding class Eisentraut taught after relocating his operations to Oakland, California from Chicago. Some time after, Bruce invested in Eisentraut’s brand and helped run the show, managing the frames that were being cranked out of the Oakland shop.</p>\n<p>Later, after a short stint in Oregon, Bruce moved to Petaluma where he began making his own bikes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1924\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/GordonMerzDinucci-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/GordonMerzDinucci-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/GordonMerzDinucci-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,770&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/GordonMerzDinucci-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1503&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/GordonMerzDinucci-scaled.jpg?resize=768,577&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/GordonMerzDinucci-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1353&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/GordonMerzDinucci-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,1003&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/GordonMerzDinucci-scaled.jpg?resize=700,526&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/GordonMerzDinucci-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1155&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/GordonMerzDinucci-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1539&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>He started making frames in 1974 but found his voice in the early 1980s. Along with Jim Merz and Mark Dinucci (pictured above), Bruce would go on long road rides throughout the Western United States. Later, in the mid-1980s, Bruce began making fat-tire road bikes. In August of 1988, he debuted a beautiful Rock ‘n’ Road.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"976\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/XA7I5062.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/XA7I5062.jpg?w=1600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/XA7I5062.jpg?resize=1024,625&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/XA7I5062.jpg?resize=768,468&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/XA7I5062.jpg?resize=1335,814&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/XA7I5062.jpg?resize=700,427&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/XA7I5062.jpg?resize=1536,937&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Lugged, with generous tire clearances, MTB drivetrain, wild paint job by Sean Walling of Soulcraft/White Industries, and touring accouterments made the Rock ‘n’ Road distinct amongst its peers.  This very bike inspired me to build <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/beautiful-bicycle-my-geekhouse-woodville-touring-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">my Geekhouse Woodville back in 2012</a>, which was made to clear the exact same Rock ‘n’ Road tires.

Here’s that <em>Schnozola from 2016 that I shot at NAHBS.</em></p>\n<p>Bruce and others in SOPWAMTOS were opposed to the big companies running the bike industry. Initially, it had a grouchy edge but, eventually, it evolved into a celebration of framebuilders. SOPWAMTOS went from the industry-wide venue of Interbike to the more appropriate framebuilder and maker celebratory venue of the North American Handmade Bicycle Show (NAHBS).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><span>﻿</span><span><span>﻿</span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Over the decades, Bruce continued to crank out models like the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/an-eroica-california-bruce-gordon-chinook-road/\" target=\"_blank\">Chinook road bike</a>, the tig-welded, overseas-made BLT, or <a href=\"https://www.adventurecycling.org/sites/default/assets/resources/bruce_gordon_bltx.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Basic Loaded Tourer</a>, as well as his own custom bikes for clients.</p>\n<p>In 2018, Bruce held a retirement sale, where he offloaded almost all of his bikes.

Here’s Nick’s flier for the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/bruce-gordon-retirement-sale/\" target=\"_blank\">Bruce Gordon Retirement Sale</a>.</em></p>\n<p>When Bruce passed, he left it all–the estate–with longtime shopmate <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/difalcofab/\" target=\"_blank\">David di Falco</a>, an automotive fabricator who shared space with Bruce for decades. In March of 2023, David reached out, asking if I’d like to buy one of Bruce’s personal bikes. At that time, what David wanted and what I could afford weren’t aligned, so I passed on the frame.</p>\n<p>Then at the MADE showcase, David pulled me aside in the middle of this year’s hustle with Josh to document as many bikes as we could from as many builders as we could and said he wanted me to have the frame. He told me “Let’s connect once you’re back home…” and we did. David made me a very reasonable offer and I immediately scrambled to secure the funds.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1972\" height=\"1315\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0285.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0285.jpg?w=1972&amp;quality=75 1972w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0285.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0285.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0285.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0285.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0285.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0285.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>About the Frame</h3>\n<p>Now, I’ve written about the notion of “ceremony” as it <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/riding-as-ceremony-a-vintage-road-bike-is-all-you-need/\" target=\"_blank\">relates to a vintage road bike</a> but I’ll argue the same pursuits apply to any vintage bike (technically this is from 2012 but is vintage in spirit), including a rim brake, 1″ headset, indexed barcon, “gravel” bike like this beaut. I looked at my long-owned and loved Sklar with its disc brakes, electronic shifting, and stout headtube and said goodbye, letting it go.</p>\n<p>I moved to Santa Fe for its ease of access to mountain biking. Riding roads, including dirt roads, is a completely different experience here from any of the other places I’ve lived. It’s not great but we have one gem. <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/no-22-bicycle-co-drifter-adventure-gravel-bike-review/\" target=\"_blank\">I’ve waxed poetic about my favorite gravel climb in town</a> that’s only accessible from the late spring until late fall and I began to ask myself “Am I doing this ride to break records, or to disconnect from the world and reconnect with myself?”</p>\n<p>Modern gravel bikes are practically mountain bikes with smaller tires. I wanted a <em>road bike</em> with bigger tires and a 43mm tire is pretty near perfect for my local terrain. If I need something bigger, I’ll just ride <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/black-cat-bicycles-swami-rigid-29er-mtb-review/\" target=\"_blank\">my rigid 29er Black Cat</a>. Ultimately, what I wanted was a bike that offered a classic experience like my old Geekhouse Woodville, in a lightweight and light-footed package.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-71.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-71.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-71.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-71.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-71.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-71.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-71.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-71.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Bruce built this bike in 2012 as a showpiece for his newly landed Rock ‘n’ Road 43mm gravel tires, which are featured on this build.

My reason for saying this is due to the tubing he elected to use: .8/.5/.8 butting Chromoly tubes. The numbers refer to the thickness of the butting profiles. On double-butted tubes the thickness of the tubes at both ends is thicker than in the center, so a typical double-butted tube (0.8/0.5/0.8) would have a thickness of 0.8mm at the end (1), a taper portion, then a center section of 0.5mm, a taper portion, and a thickness of 0.8mm at the end (2). This tubing profile is typically used on road bikes. Not off-road bikes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-47.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-47.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-47.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-47.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-47.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-47.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-47.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-47.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Bruce used straight gauge tubing on the seat stays, allowing him to bend them in an elegant form, and he crimped the chainstays to clear a triple crank and a 43mm Rock ‘n’ Road.</p>\n<p>This profile suggests a frame that will be very flexy–in the right ways–but not as strong as a bike with beefier tubing wall thicknesses (i.e. a road bike with bigger tires, not a mountain bike with smaller tires). Bruce built stout bikes, under the Rock ‘n’ Road banner, engineered to carry everything you’d need for an off-road tour and withstand the terrain you’d encounter on one. The Monster Cross bikes were not that. As such, I have to tell myself “If you want to keep a frame like this from folding, ride it with kid gloves, John!”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1334\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-5.jpg?w=1334&amp;quality=75 1334w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-5.jpg?resize=1024,1535&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-5.jpg?resize=768,1151&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-5.jpg?resize=700,1049&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-5.jpg?resize=1025,1536&amp;quality=75 1025w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-21.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-21.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-21.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-21.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-21.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-21.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-21.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-21.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Note the flaring of the head tube at each end, offering a bit more strength to a crucial juncture. </em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://brucegordoncycles.blogspot.com/2012/05/perfect-bike-comes-back-from-cyclocross.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bruce made a red Monster Cross</a> in 2012 (you can see that frame and others in <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2012-nahbs-bruce-gordon-ahearne-and-dinucci-cycles/\" target=\"_blank\">my 2012 NAHBS coverage</a>) and people wanted more frames, so he began making a small batch of bikes, including this one in 2012 with the serial number <em>G010912</em>, denoting it was G for Bruce Gordon’s personal bike, 01 for the first personal bike of 2012.

Rightfully so…</em></p>\n<p>I ride this bike in Vans and plain clothes, so these pedals and clips are great for that sort of ceremonial effort.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-82.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-82.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-82.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-82.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-82.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-82.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-82.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-82.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-37.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-37.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-37.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-37.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-37.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-37.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-37.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-37.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Speaking of White Industries, Bruce loved the Mi5 hubs, so I had Bailey at Sincere Cycles lace them up to Crust Bikes 700c rims, and Travis T from Paul Components sent over Paul quick releases.

All of the current Rock n Road tires, available at the <a href=\"https://brucegordoncycles.bigcartel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bruce Gordon Brand Store</a>, are now tubeless compatible! With gravel bikes going in the extreme tire spectrum these days, a 43mm tire is plenty for how I’ll be riding this bike. Bruce also made 48mm Rock n Roads which I rode for years on my Geekhouse, my Firefly, and <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/cotics-steel-escapade-is-a-do-it-all-drop-bar-bike-with-dirty-intentions/\" target=\"_blank\">that nice Cotic</a> I reviewed!

As I laid out before, modern gravel bikes feel like a mountain bike with smaller tires, rather than a road bike with bigger tires. The tubing profiles Bruce chose for these bikes put them firmly in the latter category. Imagine your favorite steel road bike, made from Columbus SLX tubing or the like. Now imagine that bike with a fat, 43mm tire and a geometry tuned for dirt road riding with a long, flexy stem and wide bars.</p>\n<p>That’s what the Monster Cross rides like. It planes, flexes, and careens. Road corrugations send the fork dancing fore and aft, in a harmonic resonance. Out of the saddle, it dances while being sure-footed. It’s nimble, responsive, and secure. Just lifting this massive bike causes people to exclaim “wow” as it barely tips the scale at <strong>22lbs</strong>. I spend the majority of my riding time in the drops, while using the tops for resting on long climbs.</p>\n<p>Overall, it’s exactly what I wanted in a bike for riding these stunning Rocky Mountain roads here in Santa Fe.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-65.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-65.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-65.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-65.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-65.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-65.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-65.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-65.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Ride in Peace, Bruce</h3>\n<p>Bruce Gordon was always nice to me but he certainly did have an edge about him, as one who touched as many lives and steered the dirt road bike industry from a small shop in Petaluma would.
