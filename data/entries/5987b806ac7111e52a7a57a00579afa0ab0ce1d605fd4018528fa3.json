The Tor Bikes studio is a clean, and spacious sanctuary for Shane to braze his frames. The name Tor means the rocky pinnacle of a hill, exposed and showing riders the way.

By trade, Shane is a metal fabricator and also studied mechanical engineering which is an asset for local businesses who use him to problem solve.</p>\n<p>Tor frames speak to Shane’s riding passion. The workshop wall is littered with race plates from past events predominantly in downhill, with a youth spent bombing Canberra hills before getting a taste for the intensity of cross-country. The Beechworth environs are great for road and gravel and you’ll find Shane on the bike more days than not.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1704\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-8-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-8-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-8-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-8-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-8-scaled.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-8-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1198&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-8-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,889&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-8-scaled.jpg?resize=700,466&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-8-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-8-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1363&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>In between brazing bidon bosses, Shane talked about his future build, with more pinion-based MTBs in the pipeline.

It is easy to see why the sealed belt-driven setup has merit, with weight centrally located.

The Zenith is TIG construction with a pairing of Reynolds and Columbus tubes and is available in both 27.5″ and 29″ (pictured), though for a few more beans you can opt for fillet brazed.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1704\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-26-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-26-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-26-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-26-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-26-scaled.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-26-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1198&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-26-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,889&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-26-scaled.jpg?resize=700,466&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-26-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-26-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1363&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>Throw the Zenith in the car, and you can be pedaling up Mystic Mountain, and more importantly bombing down the technical jank of ‘Elevation’ and the bermed jump lines of ‘Shred Kelly’ in under an hour. Another great reason to live in Beechworth. The lattice brace caught some criticism from those who frequently ride in sloppy terrain who saw it as a ‘mud catcher’, but in a climate as dry and arid as Australia it’s less of an issue but definitely had Shane taking notes for future iterations.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1704\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-35-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-35-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-35-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-35-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-35-scaled.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-35-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1198&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-35-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,889&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-35-scaled.jpg?resize=700,466&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-35-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/radshopvisit-fyxo-tor-35-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1363&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>While Shane can build road frames, too—as demonstrated by his own blue Cerakoted bike—his brand focus and passion is for the trails.</p>\n<p>The intersection between the road and proper trails, of course, are gravel/bikepacking-oriented frames, which Shane builds for<a href=\"https://www.mondaycycles.com/\"> Monday Cycles</a>, another Beechworth label that takes its name from the local “Monday night” gravel mob ride. This partnership involves design input by Joe Arblaster (of Monday) leaving Shane more focused on the construction side, as gravel isn’t his chosen way to recreate on two wheels.</p>\n<p>Monday launched earlier this year at the Handmade Bicycle Show Australia, and has two models in the line up: the Pilot and Pilot+ to accommodate up to a 29 x 3.0. These are explorateur-style gravel bikes, designed with multiple fixing points to carry gear, and with a focus on durability and comfort for long rides.</p>\n<p>All Tor Bike frames are painted by Mitch at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/seven4works/?hl=en\">Seven4Works</a> in Tawonga, with powder coat or Cerakote as the main preference for finishes. In the short period, I’ve come to know of Tor there has been a strong progression with each frame and I can’t wait to see what he reveals in the future.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tor-bikes-australia-shop-visit/\">Striking a Different Kind of Gold in Beechworth: Tor Bikes Shop Visit</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Josh Weinberg","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"84f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"5987b806ac7111e52a7a57a00579afa0ab0ce1d605fd4018528fa3","category":"Cycling"}
