The Slovenian headed into the World Championships road race as favourite and lived up to the billing, initially kicking away at the 100km to go mark to get to the breakaway that included countryman Jan Tratnik.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tratnik dropped back to help his teammate and a few kilometres later they joined the front group. Pogačar attacked once more on the Bergstrasse climb and had France’s Pavel Sivakov for company. The Slovenian then rode away from his breakaway companion (and trade teammate) with 52km to go and that was that. While his gap was never massive, it began to creep towards the finish line in Zürich, before stabilising at around 50 seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pogačar crossed the line after six and a half hours in the saddle to win the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/rainbow-stripes-the-history-of-the-world-championships-jersey\" target=\"_blank\">rainbow jersey</a>. Behind, Australia’s Ben O’Connor broke away from the chasing group to claim second, while <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mathieu-van-der-poel\" target=\"_blank\">Mathieu van der Poel</a> won the sprint for third.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With his latest victory, Pogačar becomes only the third man in history to complete the Triple Crown of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\"

The 28-year-old Belgian had spent the past year in the rainbow jersey and in that time won Strade Bianche, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-gallery-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Paris-Roubaix</a>, doubled up at the Belgian Championships, and raced to second place at the Giro d’Italia to name just a few achievements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kopecky had been dropped on the final climb but was able to work her way back into the lead selection. The group eventually came to the line together and Kopecky proved to be strongest in the sprint. The USA’s Chloé Dygert secured second with Elisa Longo Borghini coming home third.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was also the last year that the women’s U23 race was incorporated in the elite race.

She was taken to the Zürich University Hospital but suffered a serious head injury and passed away the next day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UCI released a statement saying, ‘The international cycling community loses a rider with a bright future ahead of her.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not much is known about the incident at the time of writing.

It is another tragic loss for Swiss cycling, coming just over a year after the death of Gino Mäder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the same day it was also announced Dutch cyclist Bas van Belle had died unexpectedly at the age of 24. The cause of death is uncertain at present. KNWU, the national governing body of cycle racing in the Netherlands, released a statement saying they would ‘remember him as a warm-hearted and friendly person, as well as a talented cyclist’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bas was the older brother of Loe van Belle, who rides for Visma-Lease a Bike, and Lisa van Belle, who is with Proximus-Cyclis CT.
