{"title":"Your Source for Scoops Half a Day Before They’re Announced Publicly","link":"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1896972159731556579","date":1741193035000,"content":"\n<p>Mark Gurman, yesterday at noon ET:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It’s not an “Air” — but the new Mac Studio, codenamed J575,\nappears to be imminent. It could be announced as early as this\nweek along with the new MacBook Airs. There are signs these will\ncome with an M4 Max but that its new Ultra chip will actually be\nan M3 Ultra.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Quite the scoop breaking this news after Apple started briefing media about it under NDA yesterday.</p>\n\n<p>He’s not fooling anyone by dropping the J575 codename (which Apple would never include in a media briefing). That’s a bit of ham-fisted misdirection to make it seem like his source for this came from a product-aware source inside Apple, when in fact he almost certainly got it from someone in the media yesterday. (Codenames in and of themselves aren’t much of a secret inside Apple. That’s one reason they keep them so boring: <em>letter-digit-digit-digit</em>, usually.)</p>\n\n<p>Apple conducted virtual media briefings yesterday for the iPad (M3 iPad Airs and A16 regular iPads) and Mac (M4 MacBook Airs and M4 Max/M3 Ultra Mac Studios). Apple announced the new iPads on Apple Newsroom yesterday morning at 9:00am ET, <em>before</em> those media briefings took place — the briefings were a recap of the announced news. Apple announced the new Macs today at 9:00am ET, <em>after</em> yesterday’s media briefings, which were under embargo until this morning. If you think it’s a coincidence that Gurman dropped zero last-minute tidbits about the new iPads (which were not briefed to the press ahead of time), but did drop the surprise M3 Ultra Mac Studio news (which was briefed, under embargo, ahead of time), I have a bridge to sell you.</p>\n\n<p>He did the same thing with the VisionOS 2.4 news (Apple Intelligence, the new Spatial Gallery app, guest mode improvements). Apple held media briefings to share this news on Friday 14 February, under the condition that it was embargoed until the VisionOS 2.4 beta <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-intelligence-comes-to-apple-vision-pro-in-april/\">dropped the next week</a>. But Gurman ran a report at Bloomberg with the embargoed info <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-15/apple-vision-pro-visionos-2-4-adds-apple-intelligence-spatial-content\">on Saturday 15 February</a>. The only stuff he’s right about lately is what he gets from someone (or someones?) in the media leaking him embargoed info. It’s not going to take Sherlock Holmes for Apple to figure this out, especially when most of the Mac briefings yesterday were later in the day, after Gurman’s tweets. I’d put even money on him burning his source yesterday.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/your-source-for-scoops\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"996a139a08cc770384e1c084964ad55ca3446bdb447f14543ee27da69c60a411","category":"Tech"}
