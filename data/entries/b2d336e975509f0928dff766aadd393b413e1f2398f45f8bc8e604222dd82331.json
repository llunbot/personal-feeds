According to a <a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0015/7771/3763/files/2024_Swiss_Side_White_Paper_Aero_Socks_9ca858c2-8837-4df5-b2cc-8b99dac204f6.pdf?v=1707981761\" target=\"_blank\">white paper</a> published by SwissSide, these make the airflow around the sock turbulent. This in turn increases the depth of the boundary layer of air between the rider’s leg and the laminar incident airflow and delays the flow separation of the air from the leg and so reduces aero drag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiss Side points out that for a cylinder, which a rider’s lower leg approximates to in shape, a reduction in aero drag of over 50% can be achieved by small changes in airflow or cylinder diameter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How much of an aero gain is achieved depends chiefly on the rider’s speed and the girth of their lower legs, but aero cycling sock designers try to maximise gains for all riders regardless of conditions. This is achieved by tripping the boundary layer so that it becomes turbulent and Swiss Side’s wind tunnel tests showed that the most aero fabric it tested could reduce the Coefficient of Aerodynamic Drag (CdA) of a 100mm diameter cylinder by 60 percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiss Side didn’t just test its sock fabrics on cylinders either. It also tested on real life lower leg shapes, fixed leg mannequins, athletes in its wind tunnel and athletes riding on the road. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other brands have also aero tested their socks, either on static or moving mannequins and some have also performed rider-plus-bike wind tunnel or outdoor testing. Although some brands have published detailed results, others haven’t shown any data to support their aero claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>UCI legal?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The UCI’s sock rule states, ‘Socks and overshoes used in competition may not rise above the height defined by half the distance between the middle of the lateral malleolus and the middle of the fibula head” (Article 1.3.003 BIS). The UCI sock police can disqualify a rider from competition whose socks don’t comply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In practice, most riders wearing aero socks aren’t likely to be competing in UCI sanctioned races, but most aero cycling socks nevertheless comply with the rule. You may get some added aero benefits from choosing longer non-UCI compliant socks though. It’s different in triathlon, where riders can choose to wear leg sleeves which extend to the knee and are, in general, even more aero. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Temperature</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All the aero cycling socks above are designed for riding in warm to hot weather. For wet or cooler weather, aero cycling overshoes are available which offer similar claimed aero benefits. They too are subject to the UCI’s sock rule.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Washing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, aero cycling socks are made of synthetic fabrics with lycra/spandex content to keep them close to your skin, so they have a maximum wash temperature of 30deg C to preserve their stretch. Dark colours are likely to be easier to keep looking pristine than whites when washed in technical wash products at low temperatures.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-aero-socks\">Best aero socks 2025 for easy gains</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"b2d336e975509f0928dff766aadd393b413e1f2398f45f8bc8e604222dd82331","category":"Cycling"}
