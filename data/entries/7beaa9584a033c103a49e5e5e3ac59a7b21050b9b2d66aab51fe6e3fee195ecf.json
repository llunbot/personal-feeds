In this article we're providing a quick summary of all the best sales we've seen so far this season, and the highlights to keep your eye on come Friday. For more on the best sales happening this week, visit our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/black-friday/\"><strong>Black Friday Roundup</strong></a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/General-black-friday-20-sale-feature-2.jpg\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>A Note On Availability</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nMore so than in years past, in 2021 we've had bigger and steeper sales in the lead-up to Black Friday, making it easier to finish up your shopping before the holiday even begins. Because we're still a few days out from Black Friday, and because many solid sales began days ago, be sure to shop now if you see something you want. Availability on particularly great deals can - and will - dwindle fast, as we saw on Walmart's $90 discount on the Apple Watch Series 3.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Where To Shop</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nOver the past few weeks we've been spotlighting the best deals coming to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/10/black-friday-spotlight-walmart-2/\"><strong>Walmart</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/18/black-friday-spotlight-target-apple-gift-card/\"><strong>Target</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/22/black-friday-spotlight-best-buy-2/\"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a>. If you like shopping at one retailer or another, we recommend browsing our spotlight posts this week to see what's available now, and what's still to come.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAdditionally, Apple this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/22/apple-black-friday-shopping-event/\">detailed its annual Black Friday sale event</a>, and as usual it's offering Apple Gift Cards alongside the purchase of regularly priced Apple products on <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/\">Apple.com</a>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough there may be instances in which this is beneficial for certain people, overall the best deals and bargains on Apple products won't be found on Apple.com during the week of Black Friday, but on Amazon, Target, Walmart, Best Buy, B&amp;H Photo, and other similar retailers. For this reason, you'll see a focus on these third-party retailers in this article.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>AirPods Pro</h2>\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/airpods-pro-blue-holiday-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><strong>What's the deal?</strong> AirPods Pro with MagSafe for $159.00</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>Where can I get it?</strong> <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JQMJHXY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26geniuslink%3Dtrue\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/153062/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-Pro%2F975690481\">Walmart</a></li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>When can I get it?</strong> Right now</li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAmazon's $90 markdown on the new <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JQMJHXY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26geniuslink%3Dtrue\">AirPods Pro with MagSafe Charging Case</a> remains one of the highlights of Black Friday 2021. It's available for $159.00, down from $249.00, and stock has been fluctuating since yesterday.

This is beating the price we were tracking earlier this week and is now an all-time low price, and while availability has been good so far this week, we don't know how well stock will continue to hold up.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>AirPods 2</h2>\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/airpods-2-blue-holiday-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><strong>What's the deal?</strong> AirPods 2 for $99.99</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>Where can I get it?</strong> <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\">Amazon</a></li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>When can I get it?</strong> Right now</li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough they're now an older model, big savings can be found on Apple's AirPods 2 this Black Friday.

You'll see this sale after an automatic coupon is applied to your order, and this is the second-best price we've ever seen on the AirPods 2.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>AirPods Max</h2>\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/airpods-max-blue-holiday.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><strong>What's the deal?</strong> AirPods Max in select colors for $429.00</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>Where can I get it?</strong> <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08PZJN7BD%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\">Amazon</a></li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>When can I get it?</strong> Right now</li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAmazon currently has <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08PZJN7BD%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\">Apple's AirPods Max</a> on sale for $429.00, down from $549.00.

The best sales you'll find as of today are <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09HF1DC1J%2Fref%3Dfs_a_wt2_us1\">$19 off Series 7 models on Amazon</a>. This is only for select models, and some discounts only reach up to $9 off.
