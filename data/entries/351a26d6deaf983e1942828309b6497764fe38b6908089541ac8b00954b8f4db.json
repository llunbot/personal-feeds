The change will take effect in early 2022, Apple said in an <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/japan-fair-trade-commission-closes-app-store-investigation/\">announcement yesterday</a>.</p>\n<p>\"The update will allow developers of 'reader' apps to include an in-app link to their website for users to set up or manage an account,\" Apple said. \"While the agreement was made with the JFTC, Apple will apply this change globally to all reader apps on the store. Reader apps provide previously purchased content or content subscriptions for digital magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, and video.\"</p>\n<p>The JFTC issued a <a href=\"https://www.jftc.go.jp/en/pressreleases/yearly-2021/September/210902.html\">statement</a> saying that the planned change \"would eliminate\" Apple's suspected violations of Japan's Antimonopoly Act. The regulator said it \"decided to close the investigation on this case after the JFTC confirms the measure has been taken.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1791704#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1791704&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"351a26d6deaf983e1942828309b6497764fe38b6908089541ac8b00954b8f4db","category":"Tech"}
