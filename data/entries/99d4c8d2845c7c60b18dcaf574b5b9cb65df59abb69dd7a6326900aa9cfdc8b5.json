For example, this enables your apps to change focus distance and aperture in movies, creating a bokeh effect, even after recording.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple offers Cinematic mode in the Camera app on iPhone 13 models and newer. Inspired by professional Hollywood films, the feature allows users to record video with a shallow depth of field and automatic focus changes between subjects.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCinematic mode uses a technique called \"rack focus\" to seamlessly shift the focus from one subject to another. It does this by locking the focus on the subject in a scene and blurring the background to achieve depth of field.
