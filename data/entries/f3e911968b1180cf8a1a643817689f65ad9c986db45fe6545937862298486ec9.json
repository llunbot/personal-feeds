Jackery also makes a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Jackery\">range of larger and smaller batteries</a> to meet various needs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Explorer 500 features a pure sine wave AC outlet, a 12V/10A carport, and three 5V 2.4A USB-A ports. It can provide power to all of your Apple products from Macs to iPhones, and it can also run TVs, fans, humidifiers, projectors, and other appliances that draw under 500 watts of power.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/09/jackery2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe built-in carport and USB-A ports can be used to power car appliances like coolers, air pumps, and vacuums, along with smartphones, tablets, and other small electronic devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA single charge can last for weeks on standby, so the Jackery Explorer 500 is ideal to have on hand for power outages and other emergencies. It can run a router or a cable modem to keep you connected while working from home, or run lights and other accessories when you're camping.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA handle at the top makes the Explorer 500 easy to carry, and a set of built-in fans keep it cool even when it's running at full power. There's an LCD screen on the front that displays the current charge level and the watts being drawn, which lets you track power usage.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/09/jackery3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWe have a Jackery Explorer 500 Portable Battery Station to give away to one lucky <em>MacRumors</em> reader, and Jackery is also offering 10 percent off all products <a href=\"https://www.jackery.com/\">on the Jackery website</a> for those who do not win.
