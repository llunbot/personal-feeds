The Slovenian once again delivers the goods at the Vuelta a Espana</p>\n<div>\n      <p> Which is the more common sight recently – Magnus Cort in the breakaway or <a href=\"/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\">Primož Roglič</a> riding past all his rivals for victory?</p>\n<p>While both occurred during Stage 11 of the <a href=\"/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta a España</a>, the <a href=\"/tags/ef-education-nippo\" target=\"_blank\">EF Education-Nippo</a> rider probably wished the latter didn’t as he was overtaken by a swarm of bodies just before the line in Valdepeñas De Jaén.</p>\n<p>The day began with a five-man breakaway out of Antequera and ended with the break of a heart. It was almost déjà-vu after Cort held Roglič at bay to see off his late charge for the win during Stage 6, but this time the feat wasn’t to be repeated.</p>\n<p>Roglič led the charge – naturally – alongside <a href=\"/tags/movistar\" target=\"_blank\">Movistar</a>’s Enric Mas, the duo side-eyeing each other as the gradient ramped up towards pre-rollercoaster drop territory with the cruel 25% incline drawing comparisons to the Mur de Huy.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/913/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2021: Route, teams and all you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/1621/12-amazing-tour-of-britain-rides\">12 amazing Tour of Britain rides</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/mark-cavendish/53/mark-cavendish-interview\">Mark Cavendish interview</a></div>    </div></div><p>\n<a href=\"/tags/jumbo-visma\" target=\"_blank\">Jumbo-Visma</a>’s leader took off like a rocket in the final 150 metres, leaving all his competitors in his wake and crucially staying upright for his second win in this year’s Spanish Grand Tour.</p>\n<p>Behind finished Mas, and a seven-second gap appeared back to riders like <a href=\"/tags/bahrain-victorious\" target=\"_blank\">Bahrain Victorious</a>’ Jack Haig, <a href=\"/tags/team-ineos\" target=\"_blank\">Ineos Grenadiers</a>’ Adam Yates and Team DSM’s Romain Bardet.</p>\n<p>Cort was left weaving and wheezing, pedalling squares and swerving across the tough road to finish in 25th place. <a href=\"/tags/egan-bernal\" target=\"_blank\">Egan Bernal</a> crossed the line 11 seconds behind Roglič alongside Odd Christian Eiking who retains the red jersey for another day.</p>\n<p>Roglič said, ‘It’s always nice to win. You never know when it’s the last one. It was a nice finish with a steep uphill where I can normally do well. It was a nice challenge and the team did an amazing job pushing really hard for the whole day and keeping the breakaway at a distance, so big thanks to them.’</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly given the drama, the pain and the spectacle, today's gallery from Chris Auld features some absolute corkers and a wheelie or two:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/10023/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-11-gallery#55\"><p><span>Image 56 of</span> 56</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/cauldphoto-vuelta-stage11-4708.jpg?itok=IGTYVGQD\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 56 of </span>56</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/10023/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-11-gallery\">Vuelta a Espana 2021 Stage 11 gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>26 Aug 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10023%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-11-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%2011%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10023%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-11-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%2011%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10023%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-11-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%2011%20gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10023%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-11-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/10023/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-11-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 56</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/cauldphoto-vuelta-stage11-3636.jpg?itok=Et29kCiX\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"d6a5a1de09da96a19d77f8752ef471fb153c049fc031cc4b35bec3981bb790f0","category":"Cycling"}
