{"title":"MG Siegler, Predicting Epic’s Win in the Fight to Get Fortnite Back in the App Store","link":"https://spyglass.org/epics-feigning-floundering-to-keep-apple-under-pressure/","date":1747953911000,"content":"\n<p>MG Siegler, back on Sunday, <em>before</em> Judge Gonzales Rogers’s “<em>settle this between yourselves or I’ll see you in court next week</em>” <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/19/the-first-rule-of-legal-fight-club\">order on Monday</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Again, Sweeney is not a moron, he has to know all of this. But why\nsimply sit quietly when you have an excuse to poke the bear again\nand raise hell for your cause? So that’s what he’s doing. He\nwasn’t going to win the legal fight, but he could win the\npolitical one. And now he’s not going to win <em>this</em> legal fight,\nbut he can win the pressure campaign. Especially important in the\nweeks leading up to WWDC...</p>\n\n<p>If I’m him, here’s the general game plan:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Re-submit Fortnite to the US App Store even though you have no\nlegal grounds to do so. No one will care about that. They will\nhave just read about your legal win and assume you won\neverything and so Fortnite can return — even though this\nparticular aspect of the case had nothing to do with that.</li>\n<li>When Apple rejects (or refuses to rule) on the new submission,\npull your app around the world under the notion that the\nunified apps all have to be updated in unison, including an\nelement bringing the US back to the App Store. So yeah, blame\nApple for this. It may even technically be true, but it doesn’t\nmatter. Again, it’s a perception thing.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-16/apple-denies-blocking-fortnite-from-eu-stores-in-epic-dispute?ref=spyglass.org\">File a new legal claim against Apple</a> for blocking your\nsubmission in light of the recent ruling. Again, this has no\nlegal grounds, but perhaps the Judge who issued that ruling is,\nin fact, <a href=\"https://spyglass.org/tear-down-the-app-store-walls/\">pissed off enough</a> to entertain this in some way — even if just in weighing in on it to dismiss it\nsympathetically, thus generating more press, instead of\nimmediately dismissing it, legally.</li>\n<li>Give more interviews about all of the above in the coming\nweeks. Again, leading up to WWDC. Keep the pressure on.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/21/fortnite-returns\">I called it a double bank shot</a> when Fortnite appeared back in the App Store, but MG described it before it happened.
