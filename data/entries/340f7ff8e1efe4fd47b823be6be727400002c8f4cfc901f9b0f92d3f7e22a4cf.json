[credit:\n                        <a href=\"https://www.htc.com/us/\">HTC</a>\n                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n  \n<p>After <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/htcs-newest-headsets-signal-end-of-vives-5-year-vr-for-the-home-mission/\">a few ho-hum announcements earlier this year</a>, HTC's virtual reality division has returned with arguably its boldest (and most mysterious) product launch yet: the <a href=\"https://www.vive.com/vive-flow\">HTC Vive Flow</a>.</p>\n<p>The new headset, whose basic concept leaked on Tuesday via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1448050993158033412\">a massive Twitter image dump</a>, will be available for preorder at some point today (perhaps right now, as this story goes live) for $499. Unlike HTC's Vive Pro line, this new VR headset does not appear to prioritize gaming or other higher-fidelity use cases.</p>\n<p>Instead, this all-in-one headset—whose massive, outward-facing lenses resemble something from a <em>Venture Bros.</em> henchman's outfit—appears to have casual users in mind. Today's announcement highlights apps that focus on \"meditation,\" \"brain training,\" and \"collaborating and socializing,\" and the latter example requires using HTC's own Vive Sync virtual conferencing software. Additionally, promotional materials provided to Ars ahead of today's reveal mention simple VR games for the platform, like <a href=\"https://www.starcadearcadellc.com/spaceslurpies\"><em>Space Slurpies</em></a>. (No, I never thought I'd type the words \"space slurpies\" in an Ars article, either.) The headset does not currently include any way to connect to gaming-grade computers, either wired or wireless, to run higher-fidelity VR experiences.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804020#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804020&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"340f7ff8e1efe4fd47b823be6be727400002c8f4cfc901f9b0f92d3f7e22a4cf","category":"Tech"}
