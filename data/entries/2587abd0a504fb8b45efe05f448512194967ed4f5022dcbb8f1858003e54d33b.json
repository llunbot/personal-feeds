Note that an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOnce beta updates have been activated, ‌watchOS 10‌ can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌watchOS 10‌ adds a whole new widget-focused interface. You can access a widget stack from any watch face using the Digital Crown, swiping through them to get to relevant information. Control Center can be activated from any app by pressing the side button, and these new quick access controls are meant to let you use watch faces that support less information while still putting everything you need at your fingertips.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are new Palette and Snoopy watch faces, updates to Cycling and Hiking workouts, and mental health integrations. Users can log their state of mind and mood using the Apple Watch, with the device providing insights into mental health over time.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/\">watchOS 10</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-9/\">watchOS 9</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135\">Apple Programming</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/apple-seeds-watchos-10-beta-4-to-developers/\">Apple Seeds Fourth Beta of watchOS 10 to Developers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-fourth-beta-of-watchos-10-to-developers.2396867/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2587abd0a504fb8b45efe05f448512194967ed4f5022dcbb8f1858003e54d33b","category":"Apple"}
