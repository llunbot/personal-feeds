When you’re indoors getting ready for a ride, it can be difficult to gauge the conditions outside and it’s all too easy to end up underdressed or overdressed, both of which can be uncomfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll probably warm up once you get moving, so unless you’re seriously underdressed on a chilly day, after a few minutes of riding you may find that you need to shed layers. People vary in how hot they get too, so what is comfortable for one rider may not be for another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, if you get the basics right, you can usually adjust your temperature during a ride. That may be by unzipping or zipping up a jersey or jacket, but items like a buff, arm warmers or a cap are easy to remove during a ride and stash away in a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-pack-your-cycling-jersey-pockets-like-a-pro\">jersey pock</a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-pack-your-cycling-jersey-pockets-like-a-pro\" target=\"_blank\">e</a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-pack-your-cycling-jersey-pockets-like-a-pro\">t</a> if you don’t need them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a guide to our recommended clothing for different seasons, from the heat of summer right through to the depths of winter. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-much-fluid-should-you-drink-when-cycling\">How much fluid should you drink when cycling?</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-much-food-should-i-take-on-a-ride\">How much food should I take on a ride?</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/road-cycling-for-beginners-everything-you-need-to-know\">Road cycling for beginners: Everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cyclist-guide-to-wet-weather-riding\">How to ride in the rain: Wet weather cycling guide</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Do I need special cycling clothing?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/04170857/rapha_commuter_jacket_h218_location_commuter_berlin_01_01_dsc4369-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"rapha_commuter_jacket_h218_location_commuter_berlin_01_01_dsc4369\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Why wear clothing specifically designed for cycling? It’s often expensive and fussy to wash and, with synthetic fabrics dominating, inclined to get smelly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But cycling clothing is designed to fit closely. That has a few advantages. First, it’s made of highly technical fabrics. The inner layers help wick sweat away from your body and, in summer, promote evaporative cooling to keep you more comfortable. In winter, the wicking effect stops that clammy wet feeling and helps prevent you from getting a potentially dangerous chill. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The close fit also helps to prevent wind flap and chafing. This can be irritating as a minimum, plus loose clothing adds <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-win-against-the-wind\" target=\"_blank\">drag</a> and therefore costs you speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/04125523/albionbibshortschammy-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"albionbibshortschammy\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cycling shorts and tights usually come with a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/elastic-interface-factory-visit\" target=\"_blank\">seat pad</a>, otherwise known as a chammy or chamois, from the days when it really was made of a single layer of chamois leather. Modern seat pads are much more complex, with multiple layers of different density foam and a soft upper layer, which can make a hard saddle a lot more comfortable for a longer ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outer layers for wet or cold weather have their own set of physical properties to help keep you more comfortable. Often, they’re insulated and have a fleece ‘Roubaix’ inner surface to keep you warmer. They may be windproof, which can help prevent windchill when the temperature drops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wet weather gear will be waterproof too. The most basic damp protection is a durable water repellent (DWR) coating on the outer surface of a garment. This tends to wet out if there’s persistent rain and also to wear off and become less effective with washing and use. It’s a good option for light protection though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heavier duty wind and/or rain protection usually comes from a membrane sandwiched between two layers of fabric. Some garments have a membrane designed to stop wind ingress, while others are also waterproof. Wind and waterproof garments may be ‘hard shell’, where there’s little stretch to the fabric and no insulation but good water resistance, or ‘softshell’, where the fabric is insulated and stretchy but may be less waterproof.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A fully waterproof garment will usually have taped seams to stop water from getting in through the stitching. This can make riding more comfortable in the rain, but a fully waterproof jacket will usually be less breathable than a softshell or unproofed jacket, and you may get sweaty.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What to wear cycling in summer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re lucky enough to be heading out on a hot <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/top-tips-for-summer-cycling\">summer day</a>, your main aim is to stay cool. That means lightweight clothing that can promote airflow over your body and wick sweat away to keep you cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth noting that, like summer cycling, indoor cycling can get very hot, so your clothing needs will be similar. You can buy <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/indoor-cycling-kit-what-to-wear-on-the-turbo\" target=\"_blank\">indoor cycling kit</a> that’s often even lighter weight than summer cycle clothing and specifically designed to be comfortable on an indoor trainer. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Top half clothing</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07123206/maap-jersey-1-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"maap-jersey-1\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07123206/maap-jersey-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07123206/maap-jersey-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07123206/maap-jersey-1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07123206/maap-jersey-1-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07123206/maap-jersey-1-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07123206/maap-jersey-1-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07123206/maap-jersey-1-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07123206/maap-jersey-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07123206/maap-jersey-1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The main component of top half clothing will be a lightweight, short sleeve <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/clothing/jerseys-and-tops\">summer jersey</a>. These will almost always have three rear pockets for food and other ride essentials. It’s important to stay protected from the sun, so many jerseys will have a UPF rating, often around 30, although some like the Le Col Pro II jersey raise this to UPF 50. Road cyclists rarely wear sleeveless tops, more out of tradition than anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lighter-weight mesh jerseys like the Castelli Superleggera may be cooler, but they will offer little sun protection, so you may need to apply sunscreen underneath to avoid sunburn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s hot debate as to whether you should <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/should-you-still-wear-a-base-layer-in-the-summer\" target=\"_blank\">wear a base layer</a> in the summer. The consensus is ‘maybe’. As discussed above, it may help with moisture transfer, but a technical jersey is made from fabrics that should achieve this in any case. With a really lightweight summer jersey, a base layer may help preserve your modesty. Women usually wear a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-sports-bras-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">sports bra</a> under their jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A base layer may also help if you’re setting off early or arriving home later and it’s cooler at the start or end of your ride. A pair of lightweight <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-arm-warmer-and-cycling-knee-warmers\" target=\"_blank\">arm warmers</a> is also useful for cool starts. These can be rolled down or removed if it warms up later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Editor’s picks</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://lecol.cc/products/pro-jersey-ii-1?variant=39962065797183\" target=\"_blank\">Le Col Pro Jersey II (£145)</a>  / <a href=\"https://lecol.cc/products/womens-pro-jersey-ii-1?variant=39962074251327\" target=\"_blank\">Le Col Womens Pro Jersey II (£145)</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.castelli-cycling.com/GB/en/Men/Cycling/Top/Men%27s-Cycling-Jerseys/Short-sleeve/CLIMBER%27S-3-0-SL2-JERSEY/p/4523012_034_52_3XL\" target=\"_blank\">Castelli Climber’s 3.0 SL2 Jersey (£100)</a> / <a href=\"https://www.castelli-cycling.com/GB/en/Woman/Cycling/Top/Jerseys/Short-Sleeve/CLIMBER%27S-2-0-W-JERSEY/p/4523037_065_52_L\" target=\"_blank\">Castelli Climber’s 2.0 Women’s Jersey (£100)</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.endurasport.com/pro-sl-s-s-jersey-yellow/14268178.html\" target=\"_blank\">Endura Pro SL Jersey (£95) </a>/ <a href=\"https://www.endurasport.com/womens-pro-sl-s-s-jersey/14267282.html\" target=\"_blank\">Endura Women’s Pro SL Jersey (£95)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bottom half clothing</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/11/05221949/assos_dyora_rs_summer_bibshorts_1_-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"assos_dyora_rs_summer_bibshorts_1_\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Summer cycling shorts, like summer jerseys, are made from lightweight fabrics to help <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-in-hot-weather-advice\" target=\"_blank\">keep you cooler</a>. Black is the traditional colour, although there are alternatives. White shorts can quickly look dirty and can be revealing, particularly if it rains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some summer shorts have a ‘coldblack’ surface treatment that reflects infrared radiation and helps to keep you cooler. Others have mesh panels on the legs for extra cooling; as with mesh jerseys, you may need sunscreen. Other shorts have cargo pockets in the legs, which can be useful if you want to stash more food or a phone, or if you’re planning a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/an-introduction-to-bikepacking\">bikepacking</a> trip. Although initially designed for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-gravel-bike\" target=\"_blank\">gravel riding</a>, they’re gaining acceptance on the road as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most cyclists usually prefer <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-cycling-bibshorts\" target=\"_blank\">bib shorts</a> to waist shorts. The bib straps help keep the shorts in place better than a waistband when you’re standing then sitting repeatedly and there’s no elastic to dig into your stomach while riding. The bibs also help to hold your seat pad in position better than a waistband. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"900\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/05001013/rapha_womens_souplesse_detachable_bibshorts_11.jpg\" alt=\"rapha_womens_souplesse_detachable_bibshorts_11\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/05001013/rapha_womens_souplesse_detachable_bibshorts_11.jpg 900w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/05001013/rapha_womens_souplesse_detachable_bibshorts_11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/05001013/rapha_womens_souplesse_detachable_bibshorts_11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/05001013/rapha_womens_souplesse_detachable_bibshorts_11-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/05001013/rapha_womens_souplesse_detachable_bibshorts_11-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/05001013/rapha_womens_souplesse_detachable_bibshorts_11-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The choice is a bit more nuanced for women riders, as a comfort break when wearing standard bib shorts may require stripping off almost completely. For this reason, some women may prefer waist shorts, although quality <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-womens-bibshorts-buyers-guide\" target=\"_blank\">women’s bib shorts</a> often come with features such as a halter neck or a release mechanism for the straps to make them easier to remove.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cycling shorts are designed to be <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/things-we-wish-we-knew-when-we-started-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">worn without underwear</a>. The seat pad will have a top layer that’s smooth against the skin and helps to absorb sweat and avoid the dreaded saddle sores. Chamois cream can help here too. Underwear adds another layer that could chafe and retain moisture next to your skin, particularly if it’s made of cotton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some brands label their seat pad for the length of ride in hours for which they’re designed. Pads for longer rides may have more dense and thicker foam padding and include other features like gel inserts.

These are specifically designed to work with your pedals, holding your feet in place more securely and improving pedalling efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cycling shoes can get complex and expensive, although <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-budget-cycling-shoes-under-120\" target=\"_blank\">budget cycling shoes</a> will probably be fine for many riders.

Two bolt cleats are small, metal and recessed into the sole, making walking easier. Three bolt cleats are large, plastic and protrude from the bottom of the shoe, resulting in the characteristic cyclist’s waddle when off the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two bolt cleats are favoured by gravel riders and some mountain bikers (who often ride flat pedals), while three bolt cleats are the preserve of road cyclists, who don’t expect to walk far off the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All cycling shoes will have stiffer soles than a regular trainer, helping to keep your feet supported and comfortable and transfer your leg power more efficiently to the pedals. Often, road cycling shoes will have very stiff carbon soles, although these may make walking even more difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most cycling shoes are built to promote airflow and keep your feet cool. They’ll usually have punched venting or mesh panels in the uppers and vent holes in the sole. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the summer, they can be paired with lightweight cycling socks. A short ankle cuff is preferred, as it helps to protect your ankles from the cranks and chain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Editor’s picks</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.fizik.com/eu_en/tempo-overcurve-r4-iridescent.html\" target=\"_blank\">Fizik Tempo Overcurve R4 Road Cycling Shoes (€219)</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/gb/en/torch-1-0-road-shoes/p/172702?color=272400-172702\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized Torch 1.0 Road Cycling Shoes (£100)</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.giro.co.uk/cycling-c45/shoes-c48/giro-cadet-road-cycling-shoes-p1532\" target=\"_blank\">Giro Cadet Shoes Road Cycling Shoes (£150)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Spring and autumn riding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the cooler temperatures typical (at least in the UK) in the spring and autumn, you’re likely to need some extra warmth and the ability to regulate your temperature, so that you stay comfortable, becomes more important than on a hot summer ride.

But <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/in-praise-of-winter-riding\" target=\"_blank\">riding in winter</a> can be just as enjoyable as at any other time of year, if you get your clothing choices right. Winter cycling is a great antidote to the winter blues and will help keep your fitness level up, so you’re better prepared for warmer summer rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key to comfort in winter is <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/layer-up-keep-riding-and-commuting-as-winter-arrives\" target=\"_blank\">layering</a>, so that you’re adequately protected and can add or remove clothing as the conditions dictate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Top half clothing</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/05181523/cross_riding_3-970x648.jpg\" alt=\"cross_riding_3\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting from the inside and working out, a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-winter-cycling-base-layers\" target=\"_blank\">long-sleeved base layer</a> is essential. It will be a lot thicker than a summer base layer to add insulation, but will still wick sweat away from your skin to avoid windchill. Winter base layers may be synthetic, but Merino wool or part-Merino is a great option that stays warm even if it gets wet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may want to wear a summer jersey over the base layer to add extra warmth if it’s really cold out, or even add a dedicated thermal midlayer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the mainstay of a winter top half outfit is an insulated, windproof <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-thermal-cycling-jackets-for-winter\" target=\"_blank\">thermal cycling jacket</a>. Softshells work well here, as they offer some waterproofing as well. Make sure that the collar, cuffs and hem fit well to keep out draughts and look for a windproof zip or a storm flap behind the zip to keep out the wind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are fully <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-waterproof-cycling-jackets\" target=\"_blank\">waterproof cycling jackets</a> too, but these are often too warm for all but the chilliest conditions and not sufficiently breathable to avoid condensation forming on their inner surface. A more versatile option is to stick with the windproof option and carry a lightweight <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-packable-cycling-jackets\" target=\"_blank\">packable waterproof jacket</a> in your pocket in case it rains. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basic boil-in-the-bag rain shells are useful, but more sophisticated (and much more expensive) jackets such as those using Gore-Tex fabrics are the gold standard, as these combine waterproofing with some breathability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Editor’s picks</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.endurasport.com/pro-sl-primaloft-jacket-ii-deep-teal/13952671.html\" target=\"_blank\">Endura Men’s Pro SL Primaloft Jacket II (£165)</a> / <a href=\"https://www.endurasport.com/women%E2%80%99s-pro-sl-primaloft-jacket-aubergine/13952485.html\" target=\"_blank\">Endura Women’s Pro SL Primaloft Jacket (£165)</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/shop/mens-pro-team-insulated-jacket/product/PIS01XXBSO\" target=\"_blank\">Rapha Men’s Pro Team Insulated Jacket (£230)</a> / <a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/shop/womens-pro-team-winter-jacket/product/WJW02XXBLW\" target=\"_blank\">Rapha Women’s Pro Team Winter Jacket (£220)</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.assos.com/gb/equipe-r-habu-winter-jacket-s9-11-30-383-18.html\" target=\"_blank\">Assos Equipe Habu Men’s Winter Jacket S9 (£310)</a> / <a href=\"https://www.assos.com/gb/uma-gt-ultraz-winter-jacket-evo-12-30-368-32.html\" target=\"_blank\">Assos Uma GT Ultraz Winter Jacket Evo (£300)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bottom half clothing</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03083020/sportful-fiandre-bib-tights-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"sportful-fiandre-bib-tights-1\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the winter, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bib-tights\" target=\"_blank\">cycling bib tights</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-womens-bib-tights-reviewed\" target=\"_blank\">women’s bib tights</a> are the go-to choice.
