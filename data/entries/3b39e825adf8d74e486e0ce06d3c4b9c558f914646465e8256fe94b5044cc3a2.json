Joseph Morelle (D-NY) <a href=\"https://morelle.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-joe-morelle-takes-action-end-ai-generated-deepfake-pornography\">announced</a> that he has re-introduced the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3106?s=1&amp;r=68\">“Preventing Deepfakes of Intimate Images Act,”</a> which seeks to \"prohibit the non-consensual disclosure of digitally altered intimate images.\" Under the proposed law, anyone sharing deepfake pornography without an individual's consent risks damages that could go as high as $150,000 and imprisonment of up to 10 years if sharing the images facilitates violence or impacts the proceedings of a government agency.</p>\n<p>The hope is that steep penalties will deter companies and individuals from allowing the disturbing images to be spread. It creates a criminal offense for sharing deepfake pornography \"with the intent to harass, annoy, threaten, alarm, or cause substantial harm to the finances or reputation of the depicted individual\" or with \"reckless disregard\" or \"actual knowledge\" that images will harm the individual depicted. It also provides a path for victims to sue offenders in civil court.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996611#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996611&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3b39e825adf8d74e486e0ce06d3c4b9c558f914646465e8256fe94b5044cc3a2","category":"Tech"}
