The \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/\">iPhone 17 Air</a>\" reportedly features a \"horizontal, bar-shaped\" design on the rear, likely referring to an elongated camera bump. On the other hand, the Pro models purportedly adopt a \"large horizontal matrix design.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast week, leaker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a> a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/iphone-17-pro-camera-design-leak/\">shared render</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a>. The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌'s three rear cameras will apparently be arranged in a familiar triangular layout, but housed in an all-new rectangular bar that extends all the way across the back of the device. The ultra-thin \"‌iPhone 17 Air‌\" is also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/alleged-iphone-17-air-shell/\">rumored to feature a horizontal rear camera bar</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe first major rumor about the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> lineup's design changes came from <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma, who <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/first-iphone-17-pro-design-leak/\">said in November</a> last year that the rear of the ‌‌iPhone 17 Pro‌‌ models will feature a new part-aluminum, part-glass design. The top half of the back will be made of aluminum and feature a \"rectangular camera bump made of aluminum rather than traditional 3D glass,\" while the bottom half will continue to be made of glass to support wireless charging. This new aluminum camera bump will also be larger than that of previous models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new Weibo post also referred to an impending \"large foldable model,\" which should increase competition in the market. The account has previously posted accurate information about the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/27/5-4-inch-iphone-12-display-images/\">iPhone 12 mini's display</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/27/iphone-15-still-to-have-smaller-sensor-than-pros/\">iPhone 15's upgraded sensor</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/28/iphone-16-pro-size-increase-camera-upgrades/\">iPhone 16 Pro size increases</a>.
