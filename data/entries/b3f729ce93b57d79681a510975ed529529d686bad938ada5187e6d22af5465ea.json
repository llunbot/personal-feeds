The update only applies to the newer charger that provides faster wireless charging up to 25W when using a 30W power adapter. This is the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2577032/apple-releases-first-magsafe-charger-firmware-in-nearly-two-years.html\">second MagSafe charger update issued this year</a> that didn’t include the older 15W charger, so it appears that Apple will no longer support that charger with new firmware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with most firmware updates, Apple isn’t divulging what it does. In an alternate universe, Apple might have issued a MagSafe update to support the new iPhone 16e, but Apple instead decided that the phone <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2623265/how-to-add-magsafe-to-the-iphone-16e.html\">wouldn’t ship with MagSafe support</a>. At any rate, we don’t know what the firmware does and likely never will.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Apple MagSafe Charger</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$39\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ4QQ5W?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">$36 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1852455-REG/apple_mx6x3ll_a_magsafe_charger_1m.html/BI/21318/KBID/22251/DFF/d10-v21-t1-x1564326/SID/pocketlint-squirrel\" target=\"_blank\">$36 at  B&amp;H</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-MagSafe-Charger-1-nbsp-m/11396405423\" target=\"_blank\">$36 at  Walmart Electronics</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>Apple’s latest 25W MagSafe charger arrived alongside the iPhone 16 in September. It is compatible with all iPhones that support MagSafe, but iPhone 12 to 15 models will only get 15W charging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To update your charger, plug it in and attach it to your iPhone. The update should arrive within a half hour. To check your firmware version, go to the Settings app, then tap <em>General</em> &gt; <em>About</em> and select the <em>Apple MagSafe Charger</em> option. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wondering what MagSafe is all about?
