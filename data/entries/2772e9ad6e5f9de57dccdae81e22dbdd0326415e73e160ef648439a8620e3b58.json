{"title":"AWS Weekly Roundup – re:Post Selections, SNS and SQS FIFO improvements, multi-VPC ENI attachments, and more – October 30, 2023","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-weekly-roundup-repost-selections-sns-and-sqs-fifo-improvements-multi-vpc-eni-attachments-and-more-october-30-2023/","date":1698682272000,"content":"<p>It’s less than a month to <a href=\"https://reinvent.awsevents.com/\">AWS re:Invent,</a> but interesting news doesn’t slow down in the meantime. This week is my turn to help keep you up to date!</p> \n<p><span><strong>Last week’s launches</strong></span><br /> Here are some of the launches that caught my attention last week:</p> \n<p><strong>AWS re:Post</strong> – With re:Post, you have access to a community of experts that helps you become even more successful on AWS. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/aws-repost-selections/\">With Selections, community members can organize knowledge in an aggregated view</a> to create learning paths or curated content sets.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon SNS</strong> – First-in-First-out (FIFO) topics now <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-sns-in-place-message-archiving-replay-fifo-topics/\">support the option to store and replay messages</a> without needing to provision a separate archival resource. This improves the durability of your event-driven applications and can help you recover from downstream failure scenarios. Find out more in this AWS Comput Blog post – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/archiving-and-replaying-messages-with-amazon-sns-fifo/\">Archiving and replaying messages with Amazon SNS FIFO</a>. Also, you can now use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-sns-message-data-protection-data-identifiers/\">custom data identifiers</a> to protect not only common sensitive data (such as names, addresses, and credit card numbers) but also domain-specific sensitive data, such as your company’s employee IDs. You can find additional info on this feature in this AWS Security blog post – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/mask-and-redact-sensitive-data-published-to-amazon-sns-using-managed-and-custom-data-identifiers/\">Mask and redact sensitive data published to Amazon SNS using managed and custom data identifiers</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon SQS</strong> – With the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-sqs-increased-throughput-quota-fifo-high-throughput-mode/\">increased throughput quota for FIFO high throughput mode</a>, you can process up to 18,000 transactions per second, per API action. Note the throughput quota depends on the AWS Region.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon OpenSearch Service</strong> – OpenSearch Serverless now supports <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-opensearch-serverless-automated-time-based-data-deletion/\">automated time-based data deletion</a> with new index lifecycle policies. To <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-opensearch-service-vector-query-filters-faiss/\">determine the best strategy to deliver accurate and low latency vector search queries</a>, OpenSearch can now <a href=\"https://opensearch.org/blog/efficient-filters-in-knn/\">intelligently evaluate optimal filtering strategies</a>, like pre-filtering with <em>approximate nearest neighbor</em> (ANN) or filtering with exact <em>k-nearest neighbor</em> (k-NN). Also, OpenSearch Service <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-opensearch-service-ipv6/\">now supports Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon EC2</strong> – With <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/multi-vpc-eni-attachments/\">multi-VPC ENI attachments</a>, you can launch an instance with a primary elastic network interface (ENI) in one virtual private cloud (VPC) and attach a secondary ENI from another VPC. This helps maintain network-level segregation, but still allows specific workloads (like centralized appliances and databases) to communicate between them.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS CodePipeline</strong> – With <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/aws-codepipeline-parameterized-pipelines/\">parameterized pipelines</a>, you can dynamically pass input parameters to a pipeline execution. You can now <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/aws-codepipeline-triggering-git-tags/\">start a pipeline execution when a specific git tag is applied to a commit</a> in the source repository.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon MemoryDB</strong> – Now <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-memorydb-graviton3-based-r7g-nodes/\">supports Graviton3-based R7g nodes</a> that deliver up to 28 percent increased throughput compared to R6g. These nodes also deliver higher networking bandwidth.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Other AWS news<br /> </strong></span>Here are a few posts from some of the other AWS and cloud blogs that I follow:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/\">Networking &amp; Content Delivery Blog</a> – Some of the technical management and hardware decisions we make when building AWS network infrastructure: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/a-continuous-improvement-model-for-interconnects-within-aws-data-centers/\">A Continuous Improvement Model for Interconnects within AWS Data Centers</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/30/interconnect-monitoring-service-infrastructure-diagram.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/30/interconnect-monitoring-service-infrastructure-diagram-1024x351.png\" alt=\"Interconnect monitoring service infrastructure diagram\" width=\"1024\" height=\"351\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/\">DevOps Blog</a> – To help enterprise customers understand how many of developers use CodeWhisperer, how often they use it, and how often they accept suggestions: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/introducing-amazon-codewhisperer-dashboard-and-cloudwatch-metrics/\">Introducing Amazon CodeWhisperer Dashboard and CloudWatch Metrics</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/\">Front-End Web &amp; Mobile Blog</a> – How to restrict access to your GraphQL APIs to consumers within a private network: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/architecture-patterns-for-aws-appsync-private-apis/\">Architecture Patterns for AWS AppSync Private APIs</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/\">Architecture Blog</a> – Another post in this super interesting series: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/lets-architect-designing-systems-for-stream-data-processing/\">Let’s Architect!
