The parties’ filings with the appeals court were \nheavily redacted where they discussed the enforcement dispute over \nApple’s workaround. Now it’s a bit clearer what technical changes \nApple made and why they managed to get their workaround Watches \ncleared. There is some hardware “designation” in the newer Watches \nthat tells the software in those Watches not to perform pulse \noximetry although all of the necessary components are present. \nMasimo managed to reenable pulse oximetry, but only after \njailbreaking older iPhones and using them to manipulate the Watch, \nwhich constitutes a “significant alteration” of the product. </p>\n\n<p>The fact that Masimo could reenable the feature by running some \ncustom software on jailbroken older iPhones absolutely positively \nmeans that Apple itself <em>can</em> reactivate that feature for its \ncustomers <em>in the event it prevails on appeal or, in the \nalternative, in late August 2028 at the latest</em> (because the \npatents-in-suit expire then). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s been <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/16/apple-workaround-itc-import-ban\">pretty clear since January</a> that the sensors in dispute are still present in newly-sold Apple Watches, and they’re simply disabled in software, but this seemingly confirms it.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/14/masimo-series-9-watch-hardware\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"364869f7bba5939bc8afbd7ce83cf908a822c1c893ab6d6652d343bb3ff7a39f","category":"Tech"}
