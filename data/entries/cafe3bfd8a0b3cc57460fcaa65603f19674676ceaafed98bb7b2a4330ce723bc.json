Object tracking analysis is up to 5x faster on the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, and takes advantage of the Neural Engine's machine learning capabilities to accelerate the detection of faces and objects in video.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFinal Cut Pro companion apps Motion and Compressor also received updates today. With Motion on the new MacBook Pro, a complex project renders up to twice as fast and can play two streams of 8K video at five times the frame rate. Meanwhile, graphic artists can now combine object tracking with masks, shapes, 3D objects, behaviors, and filters. And a new Neon filter adds an eye-catching glow to images, shapes, text, and more. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/Apple_Final-Cut-Pro-Logic-Pro_Motion_10182021.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the new MacBook Pro, Compressor can transcode HEVC video up to twice as fast and transcode ProRes video up to 10 times faster.
