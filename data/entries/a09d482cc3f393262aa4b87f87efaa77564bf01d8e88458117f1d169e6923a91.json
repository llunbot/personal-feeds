The decision reflects concerns over the reliability of articles found on the tech news outlet after it began publishing AI-generated stories in 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Around <a href=\"https://futurism.com/the-byte/cnet-publishing-articles-by-ai\">November 2022</a>, CNET began publishing articles written by an AI model under the byline \"CNET Money Staff.\" In January 2023, Futurism <a href=\"https://futurism.com/the-byte/cnet-publishing-articles-by-ai\">brought widespread attention</a> to the issue and discovered that the articles were full of <a href=\"https://futurism.com/cnet-ai-plagiarism\">plagiarism</a> and <a href=\"https://futurism.com/cnet-ai-errors\">mistakes</a>. (Around that time, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/pivot-to-chatgpt-buzzfeed-preps-for-ai-written-content-while-cnet-fumbles/\">we covered</a> plans to do similar automated publishing at BuzzFeed.) After the revelation, CNET management <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/20/23564311/cnet-pausing-ai-articles-bot-red-ventures\">paused the experiment</a>, but the reputational damage had already been done.</p>\n<p>Wikipedia maintains a page called \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Perennial_sources\">Reliable sources/Perennial sources</a>\" that includes a chart featuring news publications and their reliability ratings as viewed from Wikipedia's perspective. Shortly after the CNET news broke in January 2023, Wikipedia editors began a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_398#Beware:_CNet_running_AI-generated_articles,_byline_%22CNet_Money%22\">discussion thread</a> on the Reliable Sources project page about the publication.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007059#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007059&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a09d482cc3f393262aa4b87f87efaa77564bf01d8e88458117f1d169e6923a91","category":"Tech"}
