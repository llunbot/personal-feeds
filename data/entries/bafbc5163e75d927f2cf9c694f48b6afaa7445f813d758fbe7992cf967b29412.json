Even, if you fit a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-suspension-forks/\">dual crown suspension fork</a> (as approved by Canyon), massive desert hucks – assuming you’ve got as much nerve as Tommy G at this year’s Red Bull Rampage.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Whack a dual crown fork on the Torque and you can emulate Tommy G at Rampage – perhaps!</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ale Di Lullo / Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p><span>That’s because Canyon gives the Torque frame a ‘Category 5’ rating on strength and durability – the same as its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-canyon-sender-cfr/\">Sender DH bike</a>.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Canyon Torque frames</span></h2>\n<p><span>As we saw when we reviewed the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/canyon-spectral-cf8-cllctv-review/\">Spectral CF 8 CLLCTV</a>, Canyon puts equal emphasis on its alloy and carbon frames, with both materials getting their own engineers to fully design their respective frames.</span></p>\n<p><span>The carbon frames’ construction allows, Canyon says, for a little more fine-tuning of the feel of the bike, with strength versus weight versus stiffness differing across various parts of the frames.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The mullet bikes are built to be stable yet super-agile.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Boris Beyer / Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p><span>The carbon frames weigh around 200g less than the previous version of the bike, at around 2.6kg, but Canyon was still able to beef up various areas of the frame. These include the seatstay bridge, chainstays and around bearings and axles. At the same time, the alloy rear end of the previous version was swapped to carbon, and the front triangle also lost some weight.</span></p>\n<p><span>When it comes to the alloy frames, strength to weight is the focus, rather than stiffness, as aluminium apparently has more fixed properties and carries wider tolerances for manufacturing. Frames come in at just over 3kg.</span></p>\n<p><span>There has also been a saving of 200g on the alloy frame. Canyon says it optimised tube cross-sections, used straighter tube profiles, and worked on tube junctions and forged parts. Despite improving strength-to-weight ratios, it also managed to reduce wall thicknesses, thus saving weight.</span></p>\n<p><span>As we’ve seen with many recent Canyons, there are a lot of neat touches when it comes to frame design. </span></p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Linkage bolts are all accessed via the non-drive side of the frame.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Boris Beyer / Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p><span>For example, linkage bearings are all accessed from the non-drive side for easier maintenance, and use just 5 and 6mm Allen keys to strip down. Pivot threads are mounted on replaceable inserts on the carbon bikes, so that if you damage them they can be replaced. </span></p>\n<p><span>Alloy bikes receive stronger steel-threaded inserts. Parts are also shared between the Torque and Spectral in places, which should make getting spares easier. </span></p>\n<p><span>While ISCG05 mounts aren’t included on the carbon frame, Canyon will supply a plate to attach to the frame, should you wish to use a bash guard (a chainguide is integrated into the frame). The alloy bike comes with the mounts forged into the BB shell.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Torque will take a side-loading bottle cage, with space for a 600ml bottle. There are also rivets under the top tube for attaching tool straps and caddies. Frames feature numerous rubber protection strips too.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Canyon Torque suspension</span></h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 4-bar linkage delivers Canyon’s Triple Phase Suspension characteristics.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Heather Young / Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Canyon has long used <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">4-bar suspension linkages</a> on its bikes, with its version sporting characteristics the brand has dubbed ‘Triple Phase’.</span></p>\n<p><span>This has all the hallmarks of a sorted suspension system – soft in the early stroke to ensure plenty of traction and comfort, and a supportive middle of the stroke for good pedalling characteristics and an ability to better pump through corners and rollers. F</span><span>inally, progression late in the stroke to resist harsh bottom-outs on big hits.</span></p>\n<p><span>Canyon uses this philosophy on all its bikes, but tweaks it for intended usage.</span></p>\n<p><span>On the Torque, the manufacturer says it has taken lessons from the Strive, and upped the anti-squat (the force that helps resist pedalling-related suspension bob) by 30 per cent at the sag point. </span></p>\n<p><span>Beyond the sag point, the anti-squat drops away quickly, so that when you bottom out the suspension, pedal kickback (the amount the chain pulls backward on the chainring as the suspension compresses) is reduced.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> How good are your whips?</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Nogales / Canyon</i></span></div>\n<h2><span>Canyon Torque wheelsizes and geometry</span></h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Carbon bikes get a geometry flip chip.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Heather Young / Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Following all the usual trends, the new Torque is longer, lower and slacker than the previous generation, with a steeper seat angle too. This helps the bike’s stability at speed, while a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pushing-the-limits-of-fork-offset-an-experiment/\">short offset fork</a> and compact chainstays are there, Canyon claims, to help keep the bike playful and improve traction in tight turns.</span></p>\n<p><span>The carbon Torques receive a geometry-adjusting flip chip, altering the angles by 0.5 degrees. Alloy bikes have a fixed geometry, which is the same as the carbon’s ‘Hi’ setting.</span></p>\n<p><span>Canyon says the 29in Torque gives better rollover, improved traction and more confidence thanks to a larger tyre contact patch, longer overall bike and increased centrifugal stability.</span></p>\n<p><span>The 27.5in bike is a touch more agile, though, as well as being more precise and playful.</span></p>\n<p><span>Those who want the stable rollover and grip at the front end, along with a manoeuvrable rear end are directed by Canyon to the mullet option.</span></p>\n<p><span>29in and 27.5in bikes will be available in S, M, L and XL sizes, while the mullet bikes will be M, L and XL only.</span></p>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>﻿FRAME SlZE</th><th>S</th><th>M</th><th>L</th><th>XL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td>        </tr><tr><td>Seat tube length (mm)</td><td>395</td><td>430</td><td>445</td><td>46Θ</td>        </tr><tr><td>Τop tube length (mm)</td><td>577</td><td>604</td><td>631</td><td>658</td>        </tr><tr><td>Head tube length 27.5 (mm)</td><td>120</td><td>130</td><td>140</td><td>-</td>        </tr><tr><td>Head tube length 29er (mm)</td><td>Ι00</td><td>105</td><td>115</td><td>125</td>        </tr><tr><td>Head tube angle</td><td>63.5/64</td><td>63.5/64</td><td>63.5/64</td><td>63.5/64</td>        </tr><tr><td>Seat tube angle effective</td><td>77.5/78</td><td>77.5/78</td><td>77.5/78</td><td>77.5/78</td>        </tr><tr><td>Effective seat tube angle @ max</td><td>76,89</td><td>76,91</td><td>76,95</td><td>77,17</td>        </tr><tr><td>Effective seat tube angle @ min</td><td>78,34</td><td>78,07</td><td>77,97</td><td>78,15</td>        </tr><tr><td>Effective seat tube angle @ stack</td><td>78,44</td><td>78,79</td><td>79,04</td><td>79,23</td>        </tr><tr><td>Reference seat height</td><td>720</td><td>760</td><td>800</td><td>840</td>        </tr><tr><td>Chainstay length 27.51 mullet (mm)</td><td>435</td><td>435</td><td>435</td><td>435</td>        </tr><tr><td>Chainstay length 29er (mm)</td><td>440</td><td>440</td><td>440</td><td>440</td>        </tr><tr><td>ΒΒ offset 27.5 (mm)</td><td>14</td><td>14</td><td>14</td><td>14</td>        </tr><tr><td>ΒΒ offset 29er (mm)</td><td>30</td><td>30</td><td>30</td><td>30</td>        </tr><tr><td>Wheelbase (mm)</td><td>1225</td><td>1252</td><td>1282</td><td>1311</td>        </tr><tr><td>Stack 27.5 (mm)</td><td>618</td><td>627</td><td>636</td><td>-</td>        </tr><tr><td>Stack 29er (mm)</td><td>624</td><td>629</td><td>638</td><td>647</td>        </tr><tr><td>Reach (mm)</td><td>440</td><td>465</td><td>490</td><td>515</td>        </tr><tr><td>Spacers (mm)</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>20</td>        </tr><tr><td>Stem (mm)</td><td>40</td><td>40</td><td>40</td><td>40</td>        </tr><tr><td>Handlebar width (mm)</td><td>760</td><td>780</td><td>780</td><td>780</td>        </tr><tr><td>Crank arm length (mm)</td><td>165</td><td>170</td><td>170</td><td>170</td>        </tr><tr><td>Seatpost diameter (mm)</td><td>30,9</td><td>30,9</td><td>30,9</td><td>30,9</td>        </tr><tr><td>Dropper length (mm)</td><td>150</td><td>150</td><td>170</td><td>200</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<h2><span>Canyon Torque models</span></h2>\n<p><span>Canyon will offer six models of the Torque.
