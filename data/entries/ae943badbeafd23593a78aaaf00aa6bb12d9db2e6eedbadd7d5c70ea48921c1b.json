Not getting your launch fix? Buckle up. We're on the cusp of a boom in rocket launches as three new megaconstellations have either just begun or will soon begin deploying thousands of satellites to enable broadband connectivity from space. If the megaconstellations come to fruition, this will require more than a thousand launches in the next few years, on top of SpaceX's blistering Starlink launch cadence. We discuss the topic of megaconstellations in this week's Rocket Report.</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>.

This company enjoyed some success in raising money for its so-crazy-it-just-might-work idea of catapulting rockets and satellites into the sky, a concept SpinLaunch calls \"kinetic launch.\" But SpinLaunch is now making a hard pivot to small satellites, a move that, on its face, seems puzzling after going all-in on kinetic launch and even performing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEVD9k2GLXk\">several impressive hardware tests</a>, throwing a projectile to altitudes of up to 30,000 feet. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/spinlaunch-yes-the-centrifuge-rocket-company-is-making-a-hard-pivot-to-satellites/\">Ars got the scoop</a>, with the company's CEO detailing why and how it plans to build a low-Earth orbit telecommunications constellation with 280 satellites.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/rocket-report-no-mans-land-in-rocket-wars-isaacman-lukewarm-on-sls/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/rocket-report-no-mans-land-in-rocket-wars-isaacman-lukewarm-on-sls/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ae943badbeafd23593a78aaaf00aa6bb12d9db2e6eedbadd7d5c70ea48921c1b","category":"Tech"}
