Those patents were acquired in 2015 by Acceleration Bay, which accused Activision Blizzard of using infringing technology to develop <em>World of Warcraft</em> and at least two <em>Call of Duty</em> titles.</p>\n<p>Those accusations succeeded in court earlier this week, as a jury <a href=\"https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/movalxmnbpa/ACTIVISION%20PATENT%20TRIAL%20verdict.pdf\">found</a> a \"preponderance of evidence\" that the patents were infringed. The decision came following <a href=\"https://www.kramerlevin.com/en/perspectives-search/kramer-levin-secures-dollar234m-patent-infringement-verdict-on-behalf-of-acceleration-bay.html\">a one-week trial</a> in which Activision Blizzard argued that its networking technology works differently from what is described in the patents, as <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/activision-hit-with-234-mln-us-patent-verdict-multiplayer-gaming-case-2024-05-06/\">reported by Reuters</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022794#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022794&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"57d11ed15b6a206709b1f3d4421e38887ce8398be81451fc49416478f02384e6","category":"Tech"}
