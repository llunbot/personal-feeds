But if Kate is on the other side of the track broken down, say just before she has to report to the starting line, time wasted getting back to the pits could make or break the day. Presumably, Brad could jump on this wild ride and pedal right to the spot of the issue and fix it on the spot with the included spares and tools.</p><p>Starting with what appears to be a Scott Aspect eRide 940 frame, the bike has been given a wild paint job to resemble the ever popular oil-slick look.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17114350/Scott-World-Cup-support-bike-one-piece-carbon-bars-.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17114350/Scott-World-Cup-support-bike-one-piece-carbon-bars-.jpg\" alt=\"Brad Copeland's Scott &quot;Super Support Bike&quot;\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17114350/Scott-World-Cup-support-bike-one-piece-carbon-bars-.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17114350/Scott-World-Cup-support-bike-one-piece-carbon-bars--297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17114350/Scott-World-Cup-support-bike-one-piece-carbon-bars--800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17114350/Scott-World-Cup-support-bike-one-piece-carbon-bars--120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17114350/Scott-World-Cup-support-bike-one-piece-carbon-bars--768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>That theme continues throughout the bike including the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020/07/13/syncros-ic-fraser-hixon-integrate-lighter-one-piece-carbon-cockpits-for-xc-trail-enduro-dh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Syncros one-piece bar/stem combo</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17114401/Scott-World-Cup-support-bike-toepeak-booster-inflator-.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17114401/Scott-World-Cup-support-bike-toepeak-booster-inflator-.jpg\" alt=\"Brad Copeland's Scott &quot;Super Support Bike&quot;\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17114401/Scott-World-Cup-support-bike-toepeak-booster-inflator-.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17114401/Scott-World-Cup-support-bike-toepeak-booster-inflator--297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17114401/Scott-World-Cup-support-bike-toepeak-booster-inflator--800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17114401/Scott-World-Cup-support-bike-toepeak-booster-inflator--120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17114401/Scott-World-Cup-support-bike-toepeak-booster-inflator--768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>You’ll also find matching Topeak TubiBoosters—though from the looks of it, these aren’t your average air cans. The current <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2018/08/03/topeak-gets-modular-w-cubicubi-light-system-ninja-cages-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TubiBooster</a> X is simply an air canister that you pressurize with a floor pump. Then it stores that charge until you release it into a tire. One of Brad’s Tubiboosters has an electronic control unit on the end of it. So far details are scant, but could this be a mini compressor? A digital gauge that tops off tires to a desired pressure? We’re on the hunt for answers, and will update if we find them.</p><div id=\"attachment_271988\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17114333/Brad-Copeland-Scott-World-Cup-support-bike-rear.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-271988\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17114333/Brad-Copeland-Scott-World-Cup-support-bike-rear.jpg\" alt=\"Brad Copeland's Scott &quot;Super Support Bike&quot;\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17114333/Brad-Copeland-Scott-World-Cup-support-bike-rear.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17114333/Brad-Copeland-Scott-World-Cup-support-bike-rear-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17114333/Brad-Copeland-Scott-World-Cup-support-bike-rear-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17114333/Brad-Copeland-Scott-World-Cup-support-bike-rear-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17114333/Brad-Copeland-Scott-World-Cup-support-bike-rear-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-271988\">What tires are those?
