You make plans, and a particularly icy god laughs. (credit: 11 Bit Studios)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>I can't remember every interaction I had with the advisers in <em>Civilization </em>games, but I don't believe I ever had to send my guards to put down a protest one of them staged in a new settlement.</p>\n\n<p>Nor could I ask any of them for \"Favours\" to scrape a few more heat stamps necessary for a new food district, indebting me to them at some future point when they decide they've had enough of some other faction's people and ideas. In <em><a href=\"https://frostpunk2.com/\">Frostpunk 2</a> (</em>out today), the people who pop up to tell you how they're feeling aren't just helpful indicators, they're a vital part of the strategy. To keep these people going, you've got to make some of them mad, some of them happy, and balance a ledger of all you've gained and demanded from them.</p>\n<p>That's the biggest difference you'll notice in <em>Frostpunk 2</em> if you're coming from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/04/frostpunk-review-ice-burg/\">the original</a>. The original had you making choices that affected people, but you were the Captain, in full control of your people, at least until you angered them enough to revolt. In <em>Frostpunk 2</em>, you manage factions and communities rather than groups of survivors. You place districts, not hospitals. Time moves in days and weeks, not hours. You play multiple chapters across a landscape in a world that is 30 years removed from its initial peril.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051226#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051226&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"dd5c6a6b2dc1e5e169f94950ea6ed850f12de5b9193a34a09c29049eec05449f","category":"Tech"}
