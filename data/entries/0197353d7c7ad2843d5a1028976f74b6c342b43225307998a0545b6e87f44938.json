Tap to Pay on ‌‌iPhone‌‌ uses NFC technology to securely authenticate the contactless payments.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nChina Trust Bank and TapPay are the initial payment platforms supporting Tap to Pay for their business customers (including major customers Taiwan Mobile and Taiwan Taxi Co). Taipei Fubon Bank will add support to its payment platform later in the year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTap to Pay on ‌‌iPhone‌‌ requires ‌‌iPhone‌‌ XS or newer models, and works for customers as any normal ‌‌Apple Pay‌‌ transaction would. Sellers just need to open up the app, register the sale, and present their ‌‌iPhone‌‌ to the buyer, who can then use an appropriate contactless payment method.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTap to Pay on ‌iPhone‌ is available to over <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/wix-now-offers-tap-to-pay-on-iphone/\">700,000 additional businesses across the United States</a>, and Apple Stores in the U.S. have also rolled out the feature. Taiwan is the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/tap-to-pay/#regions\">second region</a> to support Tap to Pay.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks, Lance!)</em><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/taiwan/\">Taiwan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tap-to-pay-on-iphone/\">Tap to Pay on iPhone</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134\">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/20/apple-launches-tap-to-pay-iphone-taiwan/\">Apple Launches Tap to Pay on iPhone in Taiwan</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-tap-to-pay-on-iphone-in-taiwan.2387302/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0197353d7c7ad2843d5a1028976f74b6c342b43225307998a0545b6e87f44938","category":"Apple"}
