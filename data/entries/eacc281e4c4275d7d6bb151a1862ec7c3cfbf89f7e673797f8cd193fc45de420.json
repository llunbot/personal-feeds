Apple reportedly plans to integrate AI features across several built-in apps, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a>, Notes, Messages, and Mail. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> is also expected to undergo significant enhancements with the ability to handle complex tasks such as summarizing articles, moving files between folders, and creating multi-step workflows. ‌macOS 15‌ is also rumored to feature a redesigned Calculator app and enhanced Safari capabilities with an \"Intelligent Search\" option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nwatchOS 11 is similarly due to bring new AI-powered features to the Apple Watch, such as a more advanced version of ‌Siri‌ that is better at handling on-the-go tasks. New workout types and additional watch faces are also expected. The update will likely drop support for the Apple Watch Series 4.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌visionOS‌ 2 may address some of the gaps from the initial release of the Vision Pro, such as the introduction of native versions of several Apple apps, such as Books, Calendar, and Maps. ‌visionOS‌ 2 is also expected to feature systemwide Live Captions for improved accessibility, the ability to reorder apps on the Home screen, and respiration tracking in the Mindfulness app. \r<br />\n\r<br />\niPadOS 18 will be closely aligned with ‌iOS 18‌, bringing new AI features to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>. These likely include enhanced ‌Siri‌ capabilities, AI-assisted writing, and smart content summaries. The update will introduce a long-awaited native Calculator app to the ‌iPad‌ along with improvements to Notes, Voice Memos, and more. The Home screen is expected to be more customizable with the ability to place icons and widgets freely and change app icon colors. The Control Center may also benefit from design improvements and accessibility will be enhanced with eye tracking input.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2024</a> keynote begins at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on June 10. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/\">The MacRumors
