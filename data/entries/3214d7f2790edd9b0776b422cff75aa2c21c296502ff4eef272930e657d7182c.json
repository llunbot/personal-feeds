This was handily timed for the 2019 updates, as the 2nd-gen and then Pro versions of the AirPods launched to a newly receptive public and sold like the proverbial hotcakes. Then came the AirPods Max in late 2020, the 3rd-generation AirPods in 2021, and the 2nd-gen AirPods Pro in 2022. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where next, then, for the AirPods? In this article we will look at all the different AirPods, evaluating when Apple might next update them and the new features that could arrive with the next generation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/when-is-apples-next-event.html\">Apple Event</a> on September 9, Apple unveiled the new AirPods 4, replacing the 2nd and 3rd generation AirPods. There are two models, a cheaper AirPods 4 and a more expensive AirPods 4 with ANC. The cheaper version matches up to the expectation that Apple was planning to launch AirPods Lite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple also updated the AirPods Max with a USB-C plug, and refreshed the colors. Nothing else has changed about those models though. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, Apple revealed that new hearing-related features are coming to the AirPods Pro in 2024. On September 12, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-first-over-counter-hearing-aid-software\">announced that it authorized Apple’s “Hearing Aid Feature” for the AirPods Pro</a>. The technology then arrived in late October 2024.

The AirPods 4 replace the 2nd-gen AirPods and the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) replace the 3rd-gen AirPods. Read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2463401/airpods-4-with-anc-review.html\">AirPods 4 with ANC review</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2464323/airpods-4-vs-old-airpods-compared.html\">AirPods 4 vs old AirPods</a> to find out what’s new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AirPods Max: </strong>The AirPods Max also had an update in September 2024, nearly four years after they were introduced in December 2020, but Apple isn’t acknowledging it as a generational update. Instead, Apple introduced “New colors” and has updated the plug to USB-C (replacing lightning). </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AirPods Pro 2</strong>: While the 2nd-gen models were introduced in 2022, in September 2023 they were updated. Apple didn’t consider this update significant enough for a generational change, so they are still known as the 2nd generation AirPods Pro, but the ‘new’ model that was introduced in September 2023 comes with a USB-C charging case (replacing the lightning port) and slightly better dust proofing. Alongside the USB-C charging case, there is also a change to their IP rating, now IP54 (which indicates better dustproofing). They went on sale on September 22, 2023. In September 2024, Apple revealed that new hearing-related features are coming to AirPods Pro. These features arrived in October 2024 with the iOS 18.1 update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>EarPods</strong>: Apple last updated the wired EarPods with a USB-C cable at the September 2023 event, they previously had a Lightning cable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>AirPods 4 release date: When will the new AirPods come out? </h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>On sale from September 20</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Below you will see

suggested that Apple was going to introduce AirPods LIte at a lower price, possibly as little as $99. Ming-Chi Kuo referred to<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1445431/airpods-lite-earpods-budget.html\"> $99 as the price target for the AirPods Lite</a> in January 2023. Unfortunately, this isn’t the case and the entry-level AirPods 4 are $129/£129, while if you want Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) that will cost $50 more at $179/£179. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how much each AirPod model costs right now in the U.S. and U.K.:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apple Earbuds: $19/£19</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AirPods 4: $129/£129 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>AirPoids 4 with ANC: $179/£179 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>AirPods Pro 2nd-gen $249/£229 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>AirPods Max $549/£499 </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple used to sell versions of the AirPods with and without a MagSafe charging case, the MagSafe option cost $10/£10 more. This is no longer available. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to September 2024 pricing was as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apple Earbuds $19/£19</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AirPods 2nd-gen $129/£129 (was £139)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AirPoids 3rd-gen (Lightning) $169/£169 (was £179 at launch)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AirPoids 3rd-gen (MagSafe) $179/£179 (was £189 at launch)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AirPods Pro 2nd-gen $249/£229 (was £249 at launch)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AirPods Max $549/£499 (was £549 at launch)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668628/best-earbuds-for-iphone.html\">Best wireless earbuds for iPhones</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668694/best-wired-headphones-for-iphone-ipad.html\">best wired headphones</a> if you’d like to consider alternatives to AirPods.

This new feature arrived with the iOS 18.1 update on October 28. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloomberg’s Gurman had predicted that hearing health was going to be an area of AirPods innovation, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1656002/airpods-update-health-features-hearing-aid-fda.html\">writing in March 2023</a> that Apple’s looking at the “ability to get hearing data of some sort.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a report in July 2023, Gurman predicted, a “<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1978329/new-airpods-details-major-leak.html\">new hearing test feature</a> that will play different tones and sounds to allow the AirPods to determine how well a person can hear. The idea is to help users screen for hearing issues.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods Pro models already had Conversation Boost and Live Listen that go some way to turn them into semi-hearing aids. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>AirPods updated we are waiting for </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s where we are so far, but what new features are expected for the remaining AirPods?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>AirPods Pro (3rd-gen): Rumors and release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Current model: AirPods Pro 2nd-gen – launched September 2022, updated September 2023 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Next model: AirPods Pro 3rd gen – predicted launch 2025</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2nd generation AirPods Pro have been on sale since September 2022, although Apple did make some changes to them in September 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next update to the AirPods Pro probably won’t happen until 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the 3rd-generation AirPods Pro do arrive the indications are that they will get a new design and some new health-related features. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>AirPods Max (2nd-gen): Rumors and Release Date</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Current model: AirPods Max 1st-gen – launched December 2020, updated September 2024.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Next model: AirPods Max 2nd-gen – predicted launch 2025</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In the winter of 2024 the AirPods Max will be four years old and due an update–especially in the light of competition from other headphones, including Apple’s own Beats Studio Pro. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676921/airpods-max-homepod-dont-support-apple-musics-lossless-audio.html\">AirPods Max cannot even play Apple’s lossless audio</a> which is an omission that needs to be rectified. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September 2024 Apple made a few updates to the AirPods Max, including a new range of colors and the addition of USB-C, but there are still missing features, some of which we discuss here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2002360/apple-needs-to-totally-rethink-airpods-max.html\">Apple needs to scrap the AirPods Max and start over</a> these include: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lighter and foldable.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>USB-C to 3.5mm audio cable.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A proper case.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ability to use them as <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/201379/best-over-ear-headphones-airpods-max-vs-the-competition.html\">wired headphones</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Better sound quality, noise cancellation, and transparency.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman suggested in an October 2023 <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-25/apple-airpods-plans-4th-generation-low-end-3rd-generation-pro-and-usb-c-max\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> that the new AirPod Max will come in new colors and offer USB-C, but they “won’t see many other changes.” Gurman’s predictions were correct. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was thought that Apple would incorporate the H2 processor found in the newer AirPods Pro, but it seems that it hasn’t done so yet, so that can be expected for the 2nd generation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods Max may not be a big concern for Apple though. While Gurman notes in a December newsletter that “Apple also looks to breathe new life into the AirPods Max headphones,” he allows that: “The cans don’t sell well enough for the company to invest in entirely new hardware or software features”. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other new features coming to AirPods</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few limitations that Apple may be addressing with new AirPods. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lossless audio</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One area ripe for improvement is the ability to play <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/346837/apple-music-lossless-hi-res-lossless-spatial-dolby-atmos-iphone-airpods-android-homepod-dac.html\">Apple’s hi-res lossless audio</a>, which the company introduced in June 2021. Bluetooth headphones–including all of Apple’s AirPods–aren’t capable of playing audio at this resolution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will no doubt be looking for a way to bring this technology to the AirPods Max. The AirPods Max, despite their high price, aren’t currently capable of playing Apple’s hi-res lossless audio. An update in 2023 did bring some capacity to play high-res audio on these headphones if they are used in the wired format. Users can plug in the AirPods Max via the Lightning to 3.5mm audio cable and enjoy better quality sound, but Apple indicates that “Given the analog-to-digital conversion in the cable, the playback will not be completely lossless.” </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Crash Detection </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An Apple <a href=\"https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/20230277129\">patent</a> describes a way that motion sensors inside AirPods could aid Crash Detection. There have been reports of the iPhone and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2018801/stop-apple-watch-calling-911-999.html\">Apple Watch triggering emergency calls</a>, so it is likely Apple will have to mitigate against this happening with the AirPods. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Temperature sensor </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The big new features for the 3rd-gen AirPods Pro will apparently be health-related. Apple is said to be looking at body-temperature and health tracking. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch already incorporated a temperature sensor, used primarily for the ovulation tracking feature. Apple is said to be keen to build in body temperature measurement features to its earbuds, the ear canal is being a better and more accurate source of such data than a Watch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple is working on <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1978329/new-airpods-details-major-leak.html\">adding a temperature sensor to a future set of AirPods</a>. However, we may have to wait a little longer as Gurman isn’t convinced that this will be ready for the fourth generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re keen to hear the latest rumors about Apple’s 2025 plans, the best place to start is our roundup:  <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671090/new-apple-products.html\">New Apple products 2025</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those interested in the current range should take a look at our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673507/best-airpods-deals.html\">best AirPods deals</a> for the latest bargains.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3214d7f2790edd9b0776b422cff75aa2c21c296502ff4eef272930e657d7182c","category":"Apple"}
