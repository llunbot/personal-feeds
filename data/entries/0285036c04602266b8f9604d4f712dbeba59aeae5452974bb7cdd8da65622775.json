And today you can grab a pair for the lowest price we’ve ever seen: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDQKXDZF/\">Amazon is selling the Beats Studio Pro headphones for $160</a>, an insane $190 off the MSRP and the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We loved the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1999165/beats-studio-pro-review.html\">Beats Studio Pro</a> in our testing, giving these a 4.5-star rating and our Editor’s Choice award. We appreciated how lightweight they are and the excellent battery life. Along with Bluetooth, these headphones also allow you to experience audio via USB-C and 3.5mm (which can’t be done on the latest AirPods Max).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Even if they weren’t $200 cheaper, we’d recommend these over the AirPods Max. The lack of ear detection is a bummer, but Beats Studio Pro delivers better sound, battery life, controls, and compatibility, and they weigh a lot less, too,” our review reads, which is a big recommendation, especially considering how much we loved the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234986/airpods-max-review.html\">AirPods Max</a> (other than the price).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t want noise-canceling, Amazon also has the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZPLV566/\">Beats Solo 4 for $100</a>, half off the MSRP. When we reviewed the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2323315/beats-solo-4-review.html\">Beats Solo 4</a> and gave them a 4-star review, loving the fact that they work so well with both iOS and Android devices. They have a great battery life, and they don’t just work over Bluetooth, but also via USB-C or 3.5mm, both of which enable you to listen to lossless audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there you have it—if you want a pair of great headphones, you won’t find a better bargain than the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8PR4W22/\">Beats Studio Pro for $160</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZPLV566/\">Beats Solo 4 for $100</a>. But act fast, because we don’t know how long they’ll last after Cyber Monday.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZPLV566/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the Beats Solo 4 at Amazon</a></div>\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8PR4W22/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the Beats Studio Pro at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0285036c04602266b8f9604d4f712dbeba59aeae5452974bb7cdd8da65622775","category":"Apple"}
