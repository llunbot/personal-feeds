riding is different, which is why we’ve made sure that these gravel shoes have really been put through their paces across a range of off-road terrain and riding styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From speedy local loops to multi-day bikepacking trips with a healthy dose of hike-a-bike, each pair of clipless gravel cycling shoes has been tested in a variety of conditions so you can trust our conclusions will relate to the flavour of riding that you enjoy too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reviewer Katherine Moore is a gravel riding expert with vast experience riding gravel, writing about gravel, talking about gravel,

Here we answer a few of your most common questions to help you work out what style of shoe will work best.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why do I need gravel-specific shoes?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While you don’t necessarily need gravel-specific shoes and could potentially ride in flats, they do offer a whole host of benefits for riders heading onto the rough stuff. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, the two-bolt MTB-style metal SPD <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/components/pedals-and-cleats\" target=\"_blank\">cleat </a>offers a greater pedalling efficiency than flat shoes and pedals, but is more durable and clears mud and stones more effectively than plastic SPD-SL style road cleats. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recessed into the shoe, this also means that you can walk more easily in this style of shoe compared to<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-shoes\" target=\"_blank\"> road cycling shoes</a>, which comes in very handy for hike-a-bike sections, such as summiting a hill or mountain, linking trails or <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/an-introduction-to-bikepacking\" target=\"_blank\">setting up camp</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of hike-a-bike, some gravel shoes are designed to be flexible to allow for more comfortable hiking, while still remaining stiff when pedalling for greater efficiency. Grippy rubber soles are also used to make time spent off the bike easier. High, rubber or silicone-backed heel cups also help to keep the shoes in place while hiking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravel shoes tend to be a little lighter and less chunky than XC MTB shoes, with slightly less protective rubber elements – though they are often pretty similar. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s best, dials, velcro or laces for gravel shoes?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The best closure method comes down to personal preference, each having its own pros and cons. Boa dials (or similar) tend to give the most easily adjustable fit and are very popular, but can cause issues if you break one (despite often coming with good replacement options).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laces are preferred by some riders, but are less easily adjustable, take longer to put on, and can get easily clogged with mud or wear out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Velcro is often used in budget gravel shoes – or top end racing gravel shoes. Velcro is very hard to break, so it’s interesting to see that it’s made its way into the top-end racing options.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do I get the best fitting gravel shoes for me?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Different gravel shoe models tend to give different fits. For example, I find that Giro give a narrow fit, and am better suited to Fizik or Shimano shoes. The best way to find out which suit you best is to visit your local bike shop and try on a few different pairs from different brands and models. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you know that you have particularly wide feet, look out for the larger brands such as Shimano which offer their shoes in a wider fit option.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can you use road shoes for gravel riding?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You might have seen some of the gravel pros using road shoes for gravel racing, and this is for the optimum power transfer. These racers are unlikely to put a foot down during a race, let alone face any hike-a-bike, so road shoes aren’t a problem. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, for general use and everyday riders, road shoes aren’t recommended. Plastic three-bolt cleats don’t stand up for long to use on off-road trails.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can you use mountain biking shoes for gravel riding?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You certainly can use mountain biking shoes for gravel riding. Clipless shoes will offer greater pedalling efficiency than flats, but aren’t for everyone. There’s also an argument for running flats in the winter to combat muddier and more technical trails, as they are less likely to get clogged up with mud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefit of gravel shoes here is that they tend to be a little lighter and more streamlined. Some shoes will easily cover gravel, XC mountain biking and cyclocross, but it’s worth avoiding chunkier, more enduro and downhill-focussed models as they will be heavier and use more unnecessary reinforcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do I need toe studs in my gravel shoes?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless you plan on doing some very mucky winter riding, toe studs are generally reserved for cyclocross and some XC MTB use, so they shouldn’t be on the wish list for most gravel riders. You’ll sometimes find them incorporated into the soles of gravel shoes, perhaps to make them more versatile, or perhaps because the shoe uses the same sole as a cyclocross-oriented model.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What do the most expensive gravel shoes offer?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you spend more on premium gravel shoes, you can expect a stiffer sole for enhanced power transfer, higher quality closure methods (for example the use of premium dual-direction Boa Li2 dials), more adjustable fits such as interchangeable insole arch support, and the use of lightweight materials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Looking for more gravel cycling buying advice and news?
