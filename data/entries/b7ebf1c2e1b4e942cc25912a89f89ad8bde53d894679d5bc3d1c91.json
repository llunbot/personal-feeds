You gotta believe! (credit: Sam Machkovech)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Last April, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/04/review-playdate-earns-its-179-price-tag-with-cute-design-memorable-games/\">we enthused</a> that the tiny, yellow Playdate portable game console \"earns its $179 price tag\" with a unique design and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/04/all-24-of-playdates-included-games-reviewed/\">a lineup of free, inventive crank-powered games</a>. Unfortunately, those interested in joining the ranks of 25,000 current Playdate owners will soon have to shell out $20 more to get their hands on this adorable handheld.</p>\n<p>The increase to a $199 price is coming \"because our factory recently gave us the inevitable news that in 2023, the price of building a single Playdate is going up,\" Panic (<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/an-untitled-goose-reviews-untitled-goose-game-and-loves-it/\"><em>Untitled Goose Game</em></a>) CEO Cabel Sasser said in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr1_f-Q8Klw\">a Playdate update stream</a> Tuesday. \"Our margins are already surprisingly slim, so although we've absorbed a lot of weird price increases on this weird journey, this is the one we couldn't avoid, and we're truly sorry.\"</p>\n<p>For those who want to avoid the roughly 11 percent price hike, Panic is giving interested customers until April 7 to purchase a Playdate at the current $179 price. Customers still waiting on their preorders (which should all be fulfilled in \"early 2023,\" Panic now says) will not have to pay the higher price.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922369#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922369&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"23e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b7ebf1c2e1b4e942cc25912a89f89ad8bde53d894679d5bc3d1c91","category":"Tech"}
