The Animated category and the Illustrations utility section may be aimed at the image generation tools that are coming to ‌iOS 18‌ as part of the Apple Intelligence feature set.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also added a \"Pinned Collections\" section to ‌Photos‌, which houses things that you might want quick access to like Videos, Favorites, Screenshots, and Selfies. Collections are a repeat of content that can be found elsewhere in ‌Photos‌, but you can customize it to your liking so you see your preferred content at the top of the app. These changes to ‌Photos‌ are in iPadOS 18 and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a> as well as ‌iOS 18‌.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/ios-18-photos-app-utilities/\">iOS 18 Photos App Adds New Utilities Categories for Finding QR Codes, Receipts, Illustrations and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-photos-app-adds-new-utilities-categories-for-finding-qr-codes-receipts-illustrations-and-more.2428937/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"51f1e54605b05c5f7188a715a39c53ca495553e6119068c83d6ecb3637e00c52","category":"Apple"}
