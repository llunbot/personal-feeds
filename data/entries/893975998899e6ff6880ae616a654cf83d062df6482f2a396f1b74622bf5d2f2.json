With <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/milan-san-remo-2023-everything-you-need-to-know\">Milan-San Remo</a> – the season’s first Monument – looming in Italy, the Italian build-up race <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tirreno-adriatico\">Tirreno-Adriatico</a> garners much of the attention.</p>\n<p>But year in, year out, Paris-Nice continues to attract a stellar field of riders as well as provide great, and sometimes telling racing. This was a case in point with <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/tour-de-france\">Tour de France</a> champions Tadej Pogačar and Jonas Vingegaard lining up for a rare early-season rematch. But then in many ways, Paris-Nice is a mini Tour. </p>\n<p>Unlike the stage race Tirreno-Adriatico which cuts across the middle of Italy, Paris-Nice races through much of France, starting near Paris and finishing on the mythic French Côte d'Azur in Nice. Each stage is distinctly different, each with a unique landscape, different weather and types of racing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/pogacar-dominates-in-style-a-look-at-how-the-2023-paris-nice-unfolded\"><em><strong>Read more: Pogačar dominates in style - How Paris-Nice unfolded</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>They call Paris-Nice the Race to the Sun, and this year lived up to its reputation as the race left the winter-like weather in the north behind and basked in the sun on the final weekend around the back hills of Nice.<span> </span></p>\n<p><span>D</span>espite the constantly changing weather and terrain, Slovenian superstar Pogačar was a constant, frequently attacking and racing away from his opponents to win three stages and the yellow jersey.<span> </span>It was a commanding performance, and as he raced across the line in Nice, winning his third stage, Pogačar actually bowed, honoring not only the fans, but this historic race. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/01stg02_peloton_telegraphe_poste02_paris-nice_2023.jpg?v=1678703772\" alt=\"Riders racing past an old post office in France\" />The peloton races past an old telegraph and post office in a small village on their way to Fontainebleau during stage two.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/02stg02_pogacar02_paris-nice_2023.jpg?v=1678703825\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar in the white jersey leading the men's peloton\" />Already in the opening stages, Pogačar was constantly on the attack, attempting to translate the slightest hill or crosswind into an advantage.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/03stg02_sprint01_paris-nice_2023.jpg?v=1678703879\" alt=\"The men's peloton in a bunch sprint \" />Bunch sprints marked the opening stages, with Mads Pedersen grabbing stage two in a mad dash to the line.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/04stg03_EF_Education_paris-nice_2023.jpg?v=1678703908\" alt=\"The pink jerseys of EF Education-EasyPost during the team time trial\" /></div>\n<p>The EF Education-EasyPost team rode a masterful team time trial, finishing just one second behind the Jumbo-Visma squad, and catapulting Danish rider Magnus Cort into the yellow jersey.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/05stg03_pogacar_paris-nice_2023.jpg?v=1678703940\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar in the breakaway\" />With the help of his UAE Team Emirates team, Pogačar managed to finish just 12 seconds out of the lead.<span> </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/06stg04_breakaway03_paris-nice_2023.jpg?v=1678703988\" alt=\"The men's peloton racing through France\" />The breakaway races through a small village midway through stage four.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/07stg04_pogacar03_paris-nice_2023.jpg?v=1678704272\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar dominates during Paris-Nice \" />Meanwhile Pogačar could once again be seen driving the peloton behind.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/08stg04_pogacar_gaudu_paris-nice_2023.jpg?v=1678704377\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar celebrating his stage victory\" />Going on the attack in the final kilometers, Pogačar soloed to his first stage win on the summit of La Loge des Gardes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/09stg05_peloton01_paris-nice_2023.jpg?v=1678704420\" alt=\"Men's peloton racing through France\" />The peloton cruises past the town church in Saint-Maurice-sur-Dargoire in the opening kilometers of stage five.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/10stg05_fan04_paris-nice_2023.jpg?v=1678704512\" alt=\"Spectator watches as the peloton pass\" />This local resident takes a break as Paris-Nice rolls by his garage on stage five.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/11stg05_peloton02_paris-nice_2023.jpg?v=1678704570\" alt=\"Men's peloton crossing a bridge in France\" />The peloton crosses the Rhone River in La Voulte-sur-Rhône as they make their way towards Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/12stg07_peloton_negresco_paris-nice_2023.jpg?v=1678704660\" alt=\"Men's peloton racing through France\" />With stage six cancelled due to overpowering mistral winds, the peloton was only too happy to find the sun in Nice.
