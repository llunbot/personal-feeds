Locking an app can be done by long pressing on it and selecting the Require ‌Face ID‌ option (or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a>).\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNot all apps can be locked, with Apple not providing an option for innocuous apps like Maps, Clock, Calculator, and Stocks, but almost every other app can be locked, including third-party apps. When you lock an app, you have the option to hide it as well, which moves it into a locked, hidden apps folder that requires authentication to open.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLocked or hidden apps are not only unable to be opened, but also hidden from search, notifications, and other places across the operating system. Enabling a lock on an app also shows the apps that have access to it, such as apps that are able to write images to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> app. Hiding an app means that you will not receive incoming notifications or calls from it, and it will only be available from a \"Hidden\" folder in the App Library.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you want to turn off the locking feature, you can long press on an app icon and choose the \"Don't Require ‌Face ID‌\" option. Turning the lock on and off requires a ‌Face ID‌ scan, so it can't be turned off without your knowledge. Locking and hiding apps is also a feature that works on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-hide-lock-apps/\">iOS 18 Lets You Lock and Hide Your Apps for Added Privacy</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-lets-you-lock-and-hide-your-apps-for-added-privacy.2428745/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c4cefc6d20ad9e5ef7e93aa2cb22cfc735fc35650013e19c0dcbaf175d454214","category":"Apple"}
