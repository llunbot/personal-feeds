Well the price is pretty high and the looks aren’t our favourite, but if those things don’t bother you, this could be the last saddle you’ll ever buy.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/saddles/specialized-power-pro-elaston-saddle-review/?image=5&amp;type=gallery&amp;gallery=1&amp;embedded_slideshow=1\"> Read our full Specialized Power Pro Elaston review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Tioga Undercover Stratum</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s rare to find a saddle that stays comfortable for hours on end.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£170</li>\n<li>Lightweight</li>\n<li>Plush ride</li>\n</ul><p>The Tioga Undercover Stratum saddle uses a web-like shell covered in a thin X-Pad SL closed-cell EVA foam.</p>\n<p>The foam layer takes care of vibrations, while the shell’s role is to flex under pressure – something it does very well.</p>\n<p>Helped by a decent-sized central cut-out, comfort levels are fantastic, and at just 145g it’s also a very lightweight saddle.</p>\n<p>If the high price puts you off, there are cheaper versions available with CrMo or titanium rails.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/saddles/tioga-undercover-stratum-saddle-review/\">Read our full Tioga Undercover Stratum review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Cadex Boost</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Boost is a sensational short-nosed saddle.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£250 / $300 / AU$400 / €250</li>\n<li>Low weight</li>\n<li>Well padded</li>\n</ul><p>For a saddle weighing just 139g, the Cadex Boost is unusually comfortable owing to its padding and construction.</p>\n<p>A standard EVA foam is augmented with ETPU (expanded thermoplastic polyurethane), an elastic material borrowed from expensive running shoes that flexes under load.</p>\n<p>The all-in-one carbon saddle rail and saddle base design trim weight while adding compliance to dull road buzz.</p>\n<p>The only drawback with this superb saddle is the price you’ll have to pay for the privilege of riding it.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/saddles/cadex-boost-saddle-review/\">Read our full Cadex Boost review </a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Ere Genus CC-T Pro Road saddle</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A ‘comfort trigger’ gives three saddle-base stiffness settings.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Dave Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><span>£299 / €299</span></li>\n<li>Custom comfort</li>\n<li>Luxury at a price</li>\n</ul><p>Ere Research’s Genus CC-T Pro Road has the hallmarks of a deluxe saddle – full-length cut-out, carbon base and rails – along with a novel extra.</p>\n<p>A lever beneath the seat’s nose adjusts rigidity, so you could dial it down before cobbles and firm it up on the flat.

Long, curved shapes such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/saddles/selle-san-marco-concor-supercorsa-saddle-review/\">Selle San Marco Concor</a> were the hot item through the eighties and nineties, then we had long and flat like the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/saddles/fizik-arione-kium-saddle-in-brief-review/\">Fizik Arione</a> in the 2000s. More recently the trend has been for short and wide road bike saddles, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/saddles/specialized-s-works-power-saddle-review/\">Specialized Power</a>.</p>\n<p>Personal preference will always play a big role, so ideally you want to be able to try out bike seats of different shapes before you commit to anything. That said, it’s becoming more generally accepted that for optimum comfort and performance you want to put the pressure on your sit bones and off any surrounding soft tissue. Finding a saddle that enables you to do this is often crucial. Many of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-fix-5-of-the-most-common-causes-of-bike-pain/\">most common types of pain caused by cycling</a> are linked to ill-fitting saddles.</p>\n<p>A high-quality <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-much-difference-does-a-bike-fit-make/\">bike fit</a> from a reputable brand can be helpful here – all good fitters should have a sizeable range of bike seats for you to try. You can of course go it alone, but the trial and error process can get expensive very quickly unless you beg, borrow and steal from your riding buddies.</p>\n<p>If you’re taking part in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/10-steps-to-your-best-ever-time-trial/\">time trials</a> or triathlons, it’s also worth considering a saddle specifically designed for those disciplines, such as an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/saddles/ism-pn3-1-womens-saddle/\">ISM saddle</a>. These saddles tend to feature more radical shapes and designs, all with the intention of maximising soft-tissue pressure relief while in an aggressive riding position.</p>\n<h3>Width</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some bike fitters say narrower saddles make riders less prone to slipping around while pedalling.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Once you’ve found a shape that works for you, the next variable to look at is width.</p>\n<p>Some brands make a bigger deal about width than others, but no one’s anatomy is the same, so it intuitively makes sense that sit-bone width will vary between riders.</p>\n<p>Specialized, for example, offers an in-store method of measuring the distance between your sit bones and determining the ‘correct’-width saddle you require. A comprehensive bike fit would also take this variable into account.</p>\n<h3>Length</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Traditional, longer saddles still suit some behinds.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As already mentioned, the current trend is for shorter saddles that aim to fix you in a single position (i.e. with the pressure on your sit bones) while you ride.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t work for everyone though, and there are many who prefer the extra room to move around that a longer saddle provides. Longer saddles offer the opportunity to shift your weight around, rather than keep it concentrated in one place for the duration of your ride.</p>\n<p>This sounds great in principle. However, if you’re finding you can’t get comfortable on any saddle, and need extra length to move around and relieve the pressure on your undercarriage, there may be other fit issues at play, such as excessive saddle-to-bar drop.</p>\n<p>In any case, if you’re suffering, it’s always worth seeking out professional advice from a reputable fitter.</p>\n<h3>Bike seat padding</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Don’t judge a saddle by its padding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>It might be counterintuitive, but when it comes to padding, less is often more. Shape is usually the biggest determinant of comfort, hence why <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/andrew-feathers-cannondale-supersix-evo-hill-climb-bike/?image=17&amp;type=gallery&amp;gallery=1&amp;embedded_slideshow=1\">full-carbon saddles</a> can be surprisingly comfortable.</p>\n<p>That said, most bike seats do incorporate some sort of padding as a method of protecting against vibrations and bumps in the road. Generally speaking, though, we would tend to recommend harder padding for road cycling because a saddle that’s too soft can often lead to an inconsistent fit over the course of a long ride.</p>\n<p>If you’re finding pressure building up in specific areas, more often than not it’s a problem with shape or width, rather than a lack of padding.</p>\n<p>Again, we’ll have to caveat this by saying that everyone is, of course, different and that a good bike fit is often the best way of targeting any specific issues you’re having.</p>","author":"Simon von Bromley","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"c82b0e342852c4e71461e85d6356c3d569a9fc55a9aef6b87f0678e1f5224ee1","category":"Cycling"}
