On Monday, confirmation came in the form of a memo sent by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB): All grant money from every single agency would be on hold indefinitely. Each agency was given roughly two weeks to evaluate the grants they fund based on a list of ideological concerns; no new grants would be evaluated during this period.</p>\n<p>While the freeze itself has been <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2q4dqj2zeo\">placed on hold</a>, the research community has reacted with a mixture of shock, anger, and horror that might seem excessive to people who have never relied on grant money. To better understand the problems that this policy could create, we talked to a number of people who have had research supported by federal grants, providing them with anonymity to allow them to speak freely. The picture of this policy that they painted was one in which US research leadership could be irreparably harmed, with severe knock-on effects on industry.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/science-at-risk-the-funding-pause-is-more-damaging-than-you-might-think/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/science-at-risk-the-funding-pause-is-more-damaging-than-you-might-think/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a5af711d4db5ed13493ba2d59b55e4db028c294eb20328eb39b55e50378d4420","category":"Tech"}
