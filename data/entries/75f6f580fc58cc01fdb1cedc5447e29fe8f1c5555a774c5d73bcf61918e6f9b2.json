Over on our YouTube channel, Dan did a long term review to demo how his phone has held up and his thoughts on the Action button, battery life, and camera features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and Pro Max are Apple's first iPhones with a titanium shell instead of a stainless steel or aluminum shell, and titanium is supposed to be more durable. After suffering from several drops without a case, Dan's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> is scuffed and chipped, but there are no scratches. As for the screen, it has a minor scratch or two.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBattery health is at 98 percent and 174 cycles, and there have been some fluctuations in battery life with software updates. It's a little hard to get a solid read on battery because of day-to-day differences in usage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome people have had trouble finding a use for the Action button, but assigning it to the camera is one way to ensure that it gets used. With the camera setting, a quick press on the button launches the camera so there's no need to press on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a> or open up the Camera app. Apple is rumored to be adding a dedicated Capture button for the camera with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models, so the Action button might get less useful at that point for those who use it for the camera.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ owners, how's your battery life, and do you use the Action button?
