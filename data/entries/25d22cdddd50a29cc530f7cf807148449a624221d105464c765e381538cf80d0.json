Compared to the handlebar bags of old, modern models are robust, functional pieces of equipment that are both technical and pleasing to the eye. And, the growing popularity of the humble handlebar bag means there are more great options to choose from than ever before, coming in a range of shapes, sizes, and capacities to suit nearly every storage need. Of course, all those options means that finding the perfect bar bag can be a challenge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help, we gathered 19 of the best handlebar bags on the market and tested them for months while examining their materials, construction, ease of use, storage capacity, organizational features, stability, and attachment systems. Review author, Bennett Shane, personally tested each model to see how they perform in the real world and how they compare to each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re searching for something small, medium, or large, or are interested in finding the best value, our top handlebar bag recommendations are listed below, followed by the best of the rest, which, quite frankly, are all great options in their own right.

Handlebar Bag</a> is one of the best all-around handlebar bags we’ve ever tested, combining brilliant function and beautiful design into an astonishingly light 260-gram 3.1-liter package. The original Ornot Handlebar Bag set the bar for the industry and Ornot has made significant changes in the updated Ecopak version, moving that bar higher still. </p><p></p><p>By selecting <em>Challenge Ecopak </em>material, Ornot is not only able to achieve an excellent volume-to-weight ratio, but do so with 100% recycled material. The Ecopak material is treated with PFC-treated DWR for weatherproofing and feels like a material that will stand up to whatever comes its way for many years. </p><p></p><p>Inside the Ornot Handlebar Bag sits a rigid frame sheet that ensures the bag holds its tubular shape at all times. Importantly, however, the Handlebar Bag isn’t a perfectly tubular shape. Rather, it is flattened in the section where the zipper sits, giving the zipper track a huge boost in rigidity, making this by far the easiest and most consistent zipper to operate with one hand. The YKK zipper also has an exceptionally smooth feel, almost as though it’s been pre-broken-in, and it wraps around the outer left edge of the bag, which provides added leverage when initiating closure.  </p><p></p><p>The previous version of the Handlebar Bag had straps that were in a fixed position, but Ornot has switched to Voile straps that can be attached to the bag 4 or 6 inches apart to suit individual hand positions and handlebar accessory setups. This is a big improvement, as it can be positioned completely out of the way when riding with hands on the tops of the bars and helps ensure it stays perfectly stable. The included tether cord is super stretchy and allows the bag to be anchored to the frame or stem with plenty of tension, bolstering its stability even further. </p><p></p><p>Aside from the ample, 3.1-liter main compartment, auxiliary storage is nicely arranged, with an external phone holster with a security cord on the right side of the bag, two easy-access external stretch pockets on the rear, a large external stretch pocket on the front, and an internal clip for securing keys quietly. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=23377&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ornotbike.com%2Fproducts%2Fhandlebar-bag-ecopak-white%3Fvariant%3D46328906907940\">Ornot Handlebar Bag – ECOPAK</a> sells for $86 and is available in three colors, Coyote, Black, and White. It’s a great choice because it’s big enough for an all-day or multi-day adventure, and light enough to just free up your pockets and lower back on any road ride. </p><p></p><p>You can learn more in our <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-the-best-handlebar-bag-out-there-ornot/\">full review of the Ornot Handlebar Bag</a>.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=23377&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ornotbike.com%2Fproducts%2Fhandlebar-bag-ecopak-white%3Fvariant%3D46328906907940\">Check Price at Ornot</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest Value Bike Handlebar Bag\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://leadoutgear.com/products/lead-out-mini-handlebar-bag/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLead Out!

Mini Handlebar Bag</a> keeps your essential cargo organized and quiet, whether you’re setting the pace at the front of a group ride, or venturing into rugged and remote terrain. While the Mini Handlebar Bag has a minimal and clean aesthetic, it is a refined and robust bar bag that performs brilliantly in all the key areas. It is durable, quiet, unobtrusive, and just the right size for daily rides. </p><p></p><p>The Mini Handlebar bag holds 1.3 liters and measures 8” x 3.5”. These figures mean that you’ll be able to stuff the essentials inside and have plenty of space to move and position your hands around the entire handlebar. The tidy strap system helps here, too. Low-profile quick-release cam buckles keep the straps secure and elastic bands contain the tips of the straps so they don’t flap around and impede the top section of the handlebar.</p><p></p><p>Organization is also top-notch, ensuring that all essential items have a dedicated space inside. A small zippered exterior pocket is positioned on the left side of the main compartment and is useful for storing keys, or other small items that won’t need to be accessed frequently. Inside the main compartment, a mesh panel helps keep larger, heavier cargo, like a compact 4:3 camera or multitool stable and quiet.  </p><p></p><p>The Mini Handlebar Bag is also built to last and ready for adverse weather conditions. The exterior features <em>840D Ballistic Nylon Carbonate</em> fabric, which is abrasion-resistant and water-repellent thanks to an environmentally friendly DWR treatment. While not fully waterproof, the Mini Handlebar bag will easily fend off mud, road grime, and light rainfall. Inside, orange <em>Robic 210 Baby Ripstop</em> fabric makes it easy to quickly spot the item you’re looking for. Lead Out! is committed to sustainable practices, partnering with the best ethical factories around the world, sourcing only environmentally friendly materials, like Bluesign or OKEO-TEX certified fabrics, and treating them with 100% PFC-Free DWR.</p><p></p><p>The zipper pulls are made of paracord, making it easy to open and close the Mini Handlebar Bag with one hand while riding. Heat shrink wrapping around the zipper pulls keeps the Mini Handlebar Bag quiet on rough roads. The Mini Handlebar Bag is available in black, gray, and orange, and a reflective stripe adds visibility for oncoming motorists in low-light situations. </p><p></p><p>At just $50, the <a href=\"https://leadoutgear.com/products/lead-out-mini-handlebar-bag/\">Lead Out!

Designed for “racy adventure” as Arundel puts it, the Mini Bar Czar holds a compact 1.15-liter volume and weighs just 110g. </p><p></p><p>The weight savings are possible because of the welded seam construction, thin but durable polyester material, and magnetic closure system. That’s right, no zipper. A simple pull of the front flap disengages the magnet and gives quick access to the single interior compartment, and a gentle downward tap on the flap shuts the Mini Bar Czar tight again. As a bonus, there is no zipper constantly flapping around and making noise, which is an issue with many bags.  A shock cord keeps everything stable by anchoring the Mini Bar Czar to the head tube or stem. Minimal Velcro straps secure the Mini Bar Czar to the handlebar and lie flat. The straps can also be rotated around the handlebar to clear space for hands when placed atop the bar. </p><p></p><p>The dark gray fabric of the Mini Bar Czar is subtly decorated with a matte black Arundel badge, giving this bag a humble but business-oriented look. Its flattened oval shape not only helps the magnetic closure system to operate more easily but also keeps the weight of the contents closer to the handlebar, which minimizes bouncing on rough sections and fits a surprising amount of gear for its capacity. </p><p></p><p><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Farundel-mini-bar-czar-handlebar-bag\">Arundel’s Mini Bar Czar</a> is a great example of minimal design, not only in terms of its aesthetics but also its function, as it manages to eliminate the zipper thereby making getting in and out a much simpler and quicker task. At $70, the Mini Czar Bar Bag isn’t as affordable as most bar bags of its size, but it outclasses and outperforms most competitors. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Farundel-mini-bar-czar-handlebar-bag\">Check Price at Backcountry</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest Medium Capacity Bike Handlebar Bag\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18561&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmissionworkshop.com%2Fproducts%2Ftoro-handlebar-bag%3Fvariant%3D40249969279085\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMission Workshop Toro Handlebar Bag\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$105.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Volume</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>1.7 liters</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Dimensions</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>9\" x 4” (22.8 x 10cm)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>140 grams</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Dimension Polyant X-Pac® and Cordura Multicam fabrics</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Water-resistant?</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes, \"weatherproof\"</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Color options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Orange VX, Yellow VX, Teal VX, Purple VX, Olive VX, Coyote VX, Gray VX, Black VX, Black Camo, Tropic Camo, Stratus Black, Stratus Blue, Stratus Purple</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mission-Workshop-Toro.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"838\" height=\"559\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mission-Workshop-Toro.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Handlebar Bags of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mission-Workshop-Toro.jpeg 838w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mission-Workshop-Toro-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mission-Workshop-Toro-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mission-Workshop-Toro-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mission-Workshop-Toro-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mission-Workshop-Toro-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Very light</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Beautifully constructed – made in USA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>A multitude of colors to choose from</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Solid YKK zipper</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Compatible with shoulder strap</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>A smidge wide for narrower handlebars (40cm and under)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Expensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The USA-made <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18561&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmissionworkshop.com%2Fproducts%2Ftoro-handlebar-bag%3Fvariant%3D40249969279085\">Mission Workshop Toro</a> is a super light, mid-sized bar bag that quickly converts into a messenger bag with an included shoulder strap. Constructed from <em>Dimension Polyant X-Pac</em> material, the Toro is also waterproof, rugged, and beautifully built. </p><p></p><p>The Toro features built-in cloth straps that effortlessly attach to any style of handlebar, round or aero. Hypalon lash points on the front of Toro allow for the mounting of lights and other accessories. Because of its 9” length, The Toro will work best with handlebars sized 42cm or wider. On our 40cm handlebars, the edges of the Toro tended to rub against our index fingers when climbing with our hands placed on top of the bars. </p><p></p><p>On the road, the Toro impressed us with its stability and did not affect the handling of our bikes at all, thanks to its low weight of just 140 grams. Stability is also bolstered by an internal frame sheet stiffener that helps the Toro retain its barrel shape at all times. We found the 1.7-liter capacity to be pretty ideal for everything we need from short loops to all-day rides. To help keep noise to a minimum, the Toro features an internal clip that easily secures your keychain. For those with larger storage capacity needs, Mission Workshop also makes the Toro Grande that holds 4.68 liters of cargo.</p><p></p><p>Operating the YKK zipper is easy to do with one hand while riding, even when the Toro is empty. The zipper track is reinforced and rigid, but the zipper glides smoothly and consistently in both directions. In keeping with Mission Workshop’s design principles, the Toro’s branding is minimal, with a subtle laser-etched logo incorporated into the black trim on the front of the bag.</p><p></p><p>Available in 13 colors, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18561&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmissionworkshop.com%2Fproducts%2Ftoro-handlebar-bag%3Fvariant%3D40249969279085\">Mission Workshop Toro</a> will add plenty of charisma to the cockpit area of your bike and can compliment just about any paint scheme or overall bike aesthetic. At $105, the Toro doesn’t come cheap but is a premium handlebar bag with zero compromises and a great investment in making your epic rides a bit easier to manage. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18561&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmissionworkshop.com%2Fproducts%2Ftoro-handlebar-bag%3Fvariant%3D40249969279085\">Check Price at Mission Workshop</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest Large Capacity Bike Handlebar Bag\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://roadrunnerbags.us/products/west-coast-burrito-handlebar-bag\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRoad Runner Bags West Coast Burrito\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$125.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Volume</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>5 liters</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Dimensions</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>11” x 6” (28 x 15.2cm)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>396 grams</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>1000D Cordura</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Water-resistant?</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes, PFC-Free DWR treatment</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Color options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black, Burgundy, Grey, Navy, Olive, Rust, Coyote</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Road-Runner-Bags-West-Coast-Burrito.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"523\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Road-Runner-Bags-West-Coast-Burrito.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Handlebar Bags of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Road-Runner-Bags-West-Coast-Burrito.jpeg 523w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Road-Runner-Bags-West-Coast-Burrito-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Road-Runner-Bags-West-Coast-Burrito-120x80.jpeg 120w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Quality materials and construction</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Huge storage capacity</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Handmade in the USA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Surprisingly stable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Retains shape thanks to internal structure</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Convertible to shoulder bag with optional strap</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Expensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Aero penalty</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Heavier weight</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Too wide for bars narrower than 42cm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p><a href=\"https://roadrunnerbags.us/products/west-coast-burrito-handlebar-bag\">Roadrunner’s West Coast Burrito Bar Bag</a> will make you want to drop out of real life and see just how far you can ride with the gear and snacks you can stuff inside…which is quite a lot. At 5 liters, this is certainly more bag than you need for a simple day ride, but when riding sun up to sundown, or stringing together multiple big days, it’s an efficient and convenient 1-piece storage system. </p><p></p><p>Considering its huge volume, the West Coast Burrito is remarkably tidy and stable. An internal frame ensures that the West Coast Burrito’s Cordura body retains its cylindrical shape, and a robust three-strap mounting system gives it a tenacious hold even when fully loaded with cargo. It also features ample exterior storage, with a zippered side pocket flanking each side for small items like lip balm and credit cards, as well as elastic webbing in front for securing extra clothing. The West Coast Burrito also converts into a shoulder bag, by using Roadrunner’s Universal Shoulder Strap, available separately. </p><p></p><p>YKK water-resistant zippers are used throughout the West Coast Burrito, as well as the entire Roadrunner bar bag lineup. The only limitations of the West Coast Burrito are that it will likely not suit bikes 50cm and below, or handlebars less than 42cm in width. In the former case, because it’s 6” tall, the bottom of the bag could conflict with the front tire. In the latter, because it’s 11 inches (28cm) wide, The West Coast Burrito’s outer edges may rub against the thumbs when riding with hands on the hoods. It may also be a bit too big for those times when you aren’t carrying that much gear.</p><p></p><p>Assuming your cockpit and front-end stack height are not an issue, the <a href=\"https://roadrunnerbags.us/products/west-coast-burrito-handlebar-bag\">West Coast Burrito bag</a> is a gloriously tidy and easy-to-use bag that can simplify your least predictable adventures and elevate the style of your bike. At $125.00, it’s a premium piece of kit, but lives up to its price and then some. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://roadrunnerbags.us/products/west-coast-burrito-handlebar-bag\">Check Price at Road Runner Bags</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest Perceived Quality Bike Handlebar Bag\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=25977&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.angrycatfishbicycle.com%2Fproduct%2Fwizard-works-lil-presto-barrel-bag-31342.htm%3Fvariations%3D468797%2C605132%3Futm_source%3Dgoogle%2520shopping%26utm_medium%3Dorganic%26srsltid%3DAfmBOopJjNxkORqcYZbeS3MnjTioMt7DMOs77WXlzSjnyDC796jOccY_BdI\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWizard Works Lil Presto Barrel Bag\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$88.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Volume</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Large: 3.4 liters (tested), Small: 1.8 liters</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Dimensions</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Large: 8.6\" x 5.5\" (22 x 14cm), Small: 7.9\" x 4.1\" (20 x 10.5cm)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>325 grams (excludes straps)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Cordura</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Water-resistant?</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes, very</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Color Options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black Camo, Fluro Pink, Olive, Rust, Splatter (custom design option available)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Wizard-Works-Lil-Presto-Barrel-Bag.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1279\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Wizard-Works-Lil-Presto-Barrel-Bag.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Handlebar Bags of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Wizard-Works-Lil-Presto-Barrel-Bag.jpeg 1279w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Wizard-Works-Lil-Presto-Barrel-Bag-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Wizard-Works-Lil-Presto-Barrel-Bag-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Wizard-Works-Lil-Presto-Barrel-Bag-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Wizard-Works-Lil-Presto-Barrel-Bag-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Wizard-Works-Lil-Presto-Barrel-Bag-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Gorgeous</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Massive but tidy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Heirloom-level quality</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Comes in two sizes</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>The anchor cord could be longer or stretchier</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Moderately expensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Not the lightest</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=25977&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.angrycatfishbicycle.com%2Fproduct%2Fwizard-works-lil-presto-barrel-bag-31342.htm%3Fvariations%3D468797%2C605132%3Futm_source%3Dgoogle%2520shopping%26utm_medium%3Dorganic%26srsltid%3DAfmBOopJjNxkORqcYZbeS3MnjTioMt7DMOs77WXlzSjnyDC796jOccY_BdI\">Wizard Works Lil Presto</a> is a large and in-charge barrel bag, with a capacity of 3.4 liters. Designed for rides where being fully prepared is key, the Lil Presto invites you to pack whatever you fancy inside and cradles it all securely while adding an undeniable touch of class to your bike’s cockpit area. </p><p></p><p>Perceived quality is a rather subjective honor to give to a product, but we think it’s well-deserved. As soon as it was out of the package, we wanted it on the bike and full of snacks and clothes to help keep us comfortable on a remote and epic ride. The Lil Presto stands out because of how it interacts with the senses, particularly sight and touch. The form of the bag is very tidy – a solid tubular shape with no excess material anywhere. Sourced from a mill in Germany, the beautifully woven Cordura fabric covering our Lil Presto test bag feels like it will last into the next century. </p><p></p><p>Using the Lil Presto out on the road only enhanced our perception of its quality. The YKK Aquagard zipper is a joy to operate single-handedly, with no resistance to closing and a smooth gliding action, and allows the Lil Presto to protect the contents from the elements for hours on end. The side pockets and front daisy chain both work effectively for stashing small items and mounting accessories like clip-on lights. Inside, a brightly colored liner made it easy to distinguish contents for quick access. </p><p></p><p>Another nice touch is the inclusion of foam spacers that allow the bag to be mounted further away from the handlebar, freeing up room for cables, fingers, or bar-mounted accessories. The only minor quibble with the Lil Presto is the anchor cord, which connects the back of the bag to the frame head tube or stem. It doesn’t stretch like a bungee and isn’t quite long enough to use on one of our bikes which has a 120mm stem. Of course, it’s not actually part of the bag, and could be easily replaced with something more accommodating of longer stems, if needed. While other brands have switched to a Bungee-style strap, Wizard Works is sticking to a static cord because they provide a tighter hold when riding on rougher surfaces. </p><p></p><p>Wizard Works also offers the Lil Presto in a “small” version at 1.8 liters in volume, which, like its big sibling, is still fairly spacious in the context of barrel bags. So, if weight is a concern and 3.5 liters sounds like too much, then the small Lil Presto is worth a look. </p><p></p><p>Overall, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=25977&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.angrycatfishbicycle.com%2Fproduct%2Fwizard-works-lil-presto-barrel-bag-31342.htm%3Fvariations%3D468797%2C605132%3Futm_source%3Dgoogle%2520shopping%26utm_medium%3Dorganic%26srsltid%3DAfmBOopJjNxkORqcYZbeS3MnjTioMt7DMOs77WXlzSjnyDC796jOccY_BdI\">Wizard Works Lil Presto</a> is a super-classy bar bag that prioritizes high quality, durability, and easy operation while signaling to the world that its users have great taste.

Designed in London, this polyester bar is DWR-treated to be highly water-resistant, can be mounted within the front triangle, and converts easily into a mini-messenger bag for off-the-bike carry. At 2 liters, it’s arguably the perfect size, providing ample storage space while not crowding the cockpit area. </p><p></p><p>Attaching the Rapha Bar Bag is quick and simple, using three durable Hyperlon straps each with a plastic buckle. The rear strap is long enough to easily accommodate race bikes with an aggressive handlebar position, well forward of the headtube. This bag is unique in that it can also be mounted within the front triangle, with an extra strap on one end that captures the seat tube, giving more options for placement on the bike. It also converts to a cross-body carry with the stowable shoulder strap.</p><p></p><p>The 2-liter main compartment has two internal mesh pockets and a quick access pocket, allowing you to separate items based on how quickly and frequently you’ll need to access them. In addition to the main compartment, a small zippered compartment graces the lower face of the bag and in true Rapha style is lined with bright pink fabric with an inspirational, “Pack Light. Travel Far” printed in silver. The Rapha Bar Bag also features a daisy chain on the front that allows easy lashing of accessories like a headlight or hand pump. The material is reflective and adds a significant amount of low-light visibility. </p><p></p><p>On the road, the Rapha Bar Bag is quiet, stable, and easy to zip with one hand. While the strap position is not adjustable, the spacing is optimal for mounting accessories to the handlebars and leaving space for thumbs on top of the handlebar when climbing. </p><p></p><p>Relative to its competition, the <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18518&amp;awinaffid=723761&amp;campaign=&amp;clickref=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fshop%2Fbar-bag%2Fproduct%2FBBA01XXBLK&amp;platform=pl\">Rapha Bar Bag</a> is moderately priced at $70 and offers some flexibility in terms of mounting options and off-the-bike shoulder carry.

On the rear face of the bag is where things get interesting. Molle webbing allows the Kestrel to integrate with two styles of modular storage accessories, called the Rando Pocket and the Sidekick Stem Pouch, available separately from Swift. With both of these add-ons installed, the total storage capacity reaches a whopping 4 liters, while preserving ample space on the bar tops for free hand movement and mounting other accessories like a computer or headlight. On the bottom of the Kestrel, lashing points provide a perfect place to mount a hand pump or rain layer.</p><p></p><p>Mounting the Kestrel to the handlebar is easy and quick, using the included rubber Swift Straps and stretchy shock cord. Getting the Rando Pocket and Sidekick Stem Pouch connected is also straightforward, and it’s clear that Swift Designers approached this additional modular storage as an essential part of the Kestrel, not as an afterthought.</p><p></p><p>Despite not having an internal frame support like the Bandito bag, the Kestrel is rigid enough to make one-handed zipper operation consistent and easy. On rough surfaces, even when all three optional pieces are loaded up, the Kestrel system stays quiet and stable. </p><p></p><p>Like all Swift Industries products, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=24465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuiltbyswift.com%2Fshop%2Fkestrel-handlebar-bag%2F\">Kestrel</a> isn’t cheap.

An internal frame support ensures the Signature Bar Bag retains a cylindrical shape and helps make zipping the bag open and closed a two-finger job with zero effort. The zippers are waterproof and feature stretchy pull cords for easy grab and zero noise. </p><p></p><p>Mounting the Signature Bar Bag to your handlebar setup and hand position preferences is easy, thanks to a pair of anchoring loops for the handlebar straps. The inner loops are great for riders who like to use the tops of the bars when climbing, as the straps will fit neatly in the gap between the stem and the inner edge of the bar tape. If lights or a computer are already mounted in that space, then the outer loops will space the straps much farther apart. </p><p></p><p>With a 2.4-liter capacity and 7.5″ x 5″ dimensions, the Signature Bar Bag falls into that “just-right” size range that avoids being too large or too small and it doesn’t dominate the front of the bike. In the main compartment, a mesh pocket helps secure heavier items like a camera lens or smartphone. On the user-right side of the Signature Bar Bag sits a large zippered compartment for small, less frequently accessed items like keys or a credit card. Out front, a daisy chain offers additional mounting positions for a headlight or mini pump. </p><p></p><p>Available in six lovely colors, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Falmsthre-signature-bar-bag-cosmic-blue-2.4l-195893957545%2Fp1420632\">Signature Bar Bag</a> will coordinate easily with any bar tape or frame color. At $65, this full-featured bag is a solid value that will keep your jersey pockets free, and your gear organized, while elevating the look of your bike’s cockpit area. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Falmsthre-signature-bar-bag-cosmic-blue-2.4l-195893957545%2Fp1420632\">Check Price at Performance Bike</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tImpressively Lightweight\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Forucase-smuggler-handlebar-bag%3Fskid%3DORA000E-COY-ONESIZ\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOrucase Smuggler\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$44.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Volume</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>1.15 liters</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Dimensions</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>7.5\" x 3.5” (19cm x 8.9cm)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>86 grams</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Challenge EPX200</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Water-resistant?</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Color options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black, Black Camo, Coyote, Fuschia, Golden Daze, Lilac, Ocean Blue, Tropical Teal</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Orucase-Smuggler.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1681\" height=\"1121\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Orucase-Smuggler.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Handlebar Bags of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Orucase-Smuggler.jpeg 1681w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Orucase-Smuggler-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Orucase-Smuggler-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Orucase-Smuggler-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Orucase-Smuggler-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Orucase-Smuggler-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Orucase-Smuggler-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Super light!</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Durable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Easy to attach</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Reasonably priced</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No anchor cord</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Zipper requires two hands</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Forucase-smuggler-handlebar-bag%3Fskid%3DORA000E-COY-ONESIZ\">Smuggler</a> is the original bar bag released by Orucase, and is a brilliant option for adding a small amount of extra storage to your bike when riding fast is the objective. At just 86 grams including the straps, it’s one of the lightest bar bags available, with zero compromise in quality or durability. Available in an array of colors, the Smuggler can accentuate the vibe of your bike nicely. </p><p></p><p>One thing to be aware of is that The Smuggler does not feature an anchor cord to connect the back of the bag to the frame or stem. While subsequent bags from Orucase have adopted this design, we didn’t have any problem without one while testing the Smuggler. Part of this is based on not carrying anything especially heavy, like say a tall can of beer, or an entire repair kit inside. We used the Smuggler to store extra clothing that we removed throughout longer rides as the weather warmed up. Another reason why the Smuggler remains so stable without an anchor cord is the rubber Orucaser Gear Staps, which provides a tenacious grip on the handlebar to prevent the bag from rotating around the bar on rough surfaces.</p><p></p><p>The low weight of the Smuggler belies its rugged construction, which feels like it is ready for all kinds of punishment, thanks to its Challenge EPX200 material. This gave us the confidence to stuff whatever we didn’t want to carry into it quickly and get back to riding our bikes fast. In addition to its low weight, the Smuggler takes up minimal space in the cockpit, leaving ample room for all the important things you might need on your handlebars, including your thumbs when climbing with hands on the bar tops. It also doesn’t catch a huge amount of air, thus minimally affecting aero efficiency.</p><p></p><p>If you want to free your jersey pockets and lower back from the lightweight items that you shed throughout the day, and appreciate minimal, but rugged design, then the reasonably priced <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Forucase-smuggler-handlebar-bag%3Fskid%3DORA000E-COY-ONESIZ\">Smuggler by Orucase</a> is a great handlebar bag for you. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Forucase-smuggler-handlebar-bag%3Fskid%3DORA000E-COY-ONESIZ\">Check Price at Backcountry</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091TCT564/?tag=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tHighly Reflective\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fblackburn-grid-handlebar-bag\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBlackburn Grid Handlebar Bag\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$45.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Volume</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>1.2 liters</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Dimensions</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>8” x 3.5” (20.3 x 8.9cm)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>106 grams</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>600d Polyester</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Water-resistant?</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>DWR treated for water resistance</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Color options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Blackburn-Grid.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1338\" height=\"892\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Blackburn-Grid.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Handlebar Bags of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Blackburn-Grid.jpeg 1338w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Blackburn-Grid-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Blackburn-Grid-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Blackburn-Grid-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Blackburn-Grid-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Blackburn-Grid-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Light</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Stable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Reflective</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Affordable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Only comes in one color</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fblackburn-grid-handlebar-bag\">Blackburn’s Grid Handlebar Bag</a> provides quick access to things that are less than ideal for jersey pockets, such as a phone, wallet, jacket, or homemade snack. An interior mesh pocket helps with the quiet containment of smaller items like keys and earbuds. Built with tough and reflective materials, the Grid is ready for any adventure, day or night, paved or not.</p><p></p><p>The Grid uses tidy D-ring velcro straps that rest flush against the handlebar and leave plenty of space for fingers on the top section of the handlebar. The zipper track is stable and stiff, with a smooth-gliding zipper for easy one-handed opening and closing while riding. Keeping the Grid ultra stable is a lower bungee cable with a secure cinch hook which ensures it will never come loose and fall off on the road.</p><p></p><p>The Blackburn Grid uses a well-padded structure to retain its shape well, although it’s not a fully rigid cylinder like some barrel bags. The Grid’s interior fabric is bright red, which helps quickly identify the items you’re looking for. While the Blackburn Grid has a subdued gray color and minimal branding, it is also the only bar bag we tested with robust reflective visibility. The entire face of the bag is reflective and lights up super bright when hit with light from oncoming cars. This makes the Blackburn Grid a great choice if your rides tend to start early or end late, and you ride in an urban setting with lots of motorists. </p><p></p><p>At just 106g and $45, The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fblackburn-grid-handlebar-bag\">Blackburn Grid</a> is a highly reflective, low-volume, and high-performance bar bag that’s also budget-friendly. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fblackburn-grid-handlebar-bag\">Check Price at Backcountry</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHT8NYTF/?tag=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Farundel-handlebar-czar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tArundel Handlebar Czar\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$80.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Volume</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>2 liters (120 cu. in.)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Dimensions</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>9.5\" x 5\" x 3.5” (24.1 x 12.7 x 9cm)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>184 grams</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Water-resistant material with sonic-welded seams</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Water-resistant?</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Color options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arundel-Handlebar-Czar.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"728\" height=\"485\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arundel-Handlebar-Czar.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Handlebar Bags of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arundel-Handlebar-Czar.jpeg 728w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arundel-Handlebar-Czar-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arundel-Handlebar-Czar-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arundel-Handlebar-Czar-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Stable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Easy to open and close</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Sleek appearance</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Moderately expensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Only comes in black</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Farundel-handlebar-czar\">Arundel’s Handlebar Czar</a> is a 2-liter, water-resistant bar bag with sonic welded seam construction. This handsome and classy bag features a glossy black exterior that aesthetically sets it apart from the crowd of barrel-shaped cloth-covered bar bags we tested. The sonic welding method ensures that the Handlebar Czar retains its shape when empty, bolsters stiffness to make the zipper easier to operate, and also keeps the weight down. </p><p></p><p>The Handlebar Czar mounts with two simple velcro straps that can be positioned close-in to the stem, or wider apart on the bar tape. Instead of the typical cord that anchors most bar bags to the frame or stem, the Handlebar Czar relies on a simple rubber twist tie that wraps around the cable and housing. If your bike has hidden cables, you can still fit a small bungee cord to the Handlbar Czar, although that will need to be purchased separately. The Handlebar Czar can be anchored from the sides, by connecting to the handlebar just below the shift lever, using included cords. </p><p></p><p>At the base of the face, a small mesh pocket holds small items that need to be accessed easily on the ride. It’s not designed for valuables like keys or credit cards but is useful for bars, gels, or wrappers. There is no dedicated pocket or internal compartment for things like keys, earbuds, or multitool on the Handlebar Czar, but the bright orange inner lining makes it easy to find the item you’re looking for. </p><p></p><p>On the road, the Handlebar Czar worked flawlessly, staying quiet and accommodating all kinds of things easily, from food to clothes, to a compact 4:3 camera and two lenses. Everything stayed quiet and dry, even on rough roads. </p><p></p><p>At $80, The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Farundel-handlebar-czar\">Handlebar Czar</a> is priced close to some stiff competition, but competes admirably and is worth a hard look by riders who want something a bit different and and appreciate its elegant look. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Farundel-handlebar-czar\">Check Price at Backcountry</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SKXDBKL/?tag=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=23377&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ornotbike.com%2Fproducts%2Fhandlebar-bag-mini-ecopak-coyote%3Fvariant%3D45068223578404\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOrnot Handlebar Bag Mini\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$54.00 (ECOPAK), $44.00 (regular)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Volume</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>1.15 liters</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Dimensions</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>7.25” x 3.5” (18.4 x 9cm)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>140 grams</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Ecopak Recycled Fabric</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Water-resistant?</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes, PFC-Free DWR treatment</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Color options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black ECOPAK, Coyote ECOPAK, White ECOPAK, Black, Stone Blue, Olive, Morroco, Nordic</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ornot-Handlebar-bag-mini.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"817\" height=\"545\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ornot-Handlebar-bag-mini.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Handlebar Bags of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ornot-Handlebar-bag-mini.jpeg 817w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ornot-Handlebar-bag-mini-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ornot-Handlebar-bag-mini-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ornot-Handlebar-bag-mini-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ornot-Handlebar-bag-mini-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ornot-Handlebar-bag-mini-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Light</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Stable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Easy to open and close</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Super tidy look on the bars</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Straps may need to be trimmed for thumb clearance</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Smaller volume may be limiting for some riders</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=23377&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ornotbike.com%2Fproducts%2Fhandlebar-bag-mini-ecopak-coyote%3Fvariant%3D45068223578404\">Mini Handlebar Bag</a> is a stout and stable compact bar bag that is well-made and thoughtfully designed, just like everything else Ornot makes. This 140-gram, 1.15-liter bag holds the essentials, and looks darn good doing it, without taking up too much space on the bars. </p><p></p><p>Like the larger Handlebar Bag, the Mini is crafted with the same 100% recycled ECOPAK material that’s been treated with a PFC-treated DWR for weather resistance. This material feels tough, durable, and ready for years of faithful service, and while it isn’t completely waterproof, it fends off light amounts of moisture with ease. The Ornot Mini Handlebar Bag holds its tubular shape thanks to an internal structure that also gives the zipper track a boost in rigidity, making one-handed zipping smooth and easy and preventing it from flopping around or sagging. </p><p></p><p>Two simple hook and loop straps make attaching the Mini super easy and the elastic tether cord ensures stability over imperfect pavement or rough gravel roads. The 1.15-liter volume is a great size to keep essentials like snacks, a phone (Ornot claims it fits an iPhone Max), keys, or a light, packable layer. There’s also an internal zippered pocket to keep your keys and credit card extra secure. A webbing strap across the front of the Mini has a reflective strip to add a hint of visibility and creates attachment points to clip smaller items externally. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=23377&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ornotbike.com%2Fproducts%2Fhandlebar-bag-mini-ecopak-coyote%3Fvariant%3D45068223578404\">Ornot Mini Handlebar Bag</a> – ECOPAK sells for $54 and is available in three colors, Coyote, Black, and White, and it also comes in a <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=23377&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ornotbike.com%2Fproducts%2Fhandlebar-bag-mini-olive%3Fvariant%3D39424520192065\">standard version that sells for $10 less</a> and comes in several different color options.

The design is simple and easy to use, consisting of a large main compartment, plus a smaller zippered compartment on the lower face of the bag, useful for securing things like keys, credit cards, and earbuds. Three buckled straps hold the bag securely to the handlebar and headtube.</p><p></p><p>The total storage capacity is 2.2 liters, which is impressive when considering the low weight of just 150g. That low weight is due in part to the lack of internal structure, which means that the Lowland Crafts Handlebar Bag will work best when carrying softer and lighter items like clothing and snacks. </p><p></p><p>The straps are one of the best features of the Lowland Crafts Handlebar Bag. While their narrow width and small buckles require a bit of touch to position and adjust, the benefit is that they are super-low bulk and don’t interfere at all with riding, and the super soft surface won’t affect the frame paint on the head tube. </p><p></p><p>While the Lowland Crafts bar bag exudes a cheerful and casual vibe, it’s ready for fast-paced road rides and epic adventures.

A rigid internal frame sheet gives the Bandito a permanent cylindrical structure, making it stable on rough roads, easy to zip open and shut, and beautiful as it sits proudly in the cockpit area of any bike.  </p><p></p><p>A daisy chain on the front panel can be used to lash headlights and other accessories like a hand pump. D-ring clips on either side of the Bandito allow attachment of a shoulder strap that is available separately from Swift Industries for off-the-bike cross-body carry. Rubber <em>Swift Straps</em> connect the Bandito to the handlebar and have only one pair of mounting loops, which are spaced fairly wide apart but hold the bar very securely for excellent stability. </p><p></p><p>The Bandito has one main interior compartment and no external pockets. While this does limit organization options, it helps keep the Bandito lightweight for its size and simple to use. The 400D Packcloth interior lining is a gray color that does not offer super high contrast but is light enough to easily spot the item you’re looking for. The Bandito is available in four beautiful colors – Coyote, Black, Redwood, and the gorgeous teal color that we tested. An optional foam spacer kit sold separately allows the Bandito to be positioned further away from the handlebar to open up access to a secure and powerful grip on the top section of the handlebar, or to make space for other bar-mounted accessories. </p><p></p><p>At $95, The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=24465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuiltbyswift.com%2Fshop%2Fbandito-bicycle-bag%2F\">Swift Industries Bandito</a> is a premium bar bag that will last ages and make your long rides more enjoyable.

Made from Ripstop nylon, and graced with timeless style as well as plenty of smart features, it will keep your cargo dry, organized, and quiet on even the roughest roads and in the worst weather, year after year. </p><p></p><p>Two zippered compartments help keep items organized and quiet. Large elastic loops on both zippers allow you to easily hook a finger into the loop, to gain better leverage. The back of the Explore bar bag is covered in protective Hypalon, to prevent brake hoses and gear cables from damaging the bag as they rub against it. Integrated velcro straps make attaching the Explore Bar Bag simple and quick. The straps are decorated in a geometric pattern that gives the Explore Bar Bag a little extra pop. Overall, this is a beautiful bag that is a study in minimal design. </p><p></p><p>At $80, the Rapha Explore Bar Bag is up against some stiff competition but does have an edge in water resistance. The lightweight recycled nylon shell is DWR-treated, the seams are taped, and the interior is coated with polyurethane to keep all but the worst rain from creeping in. The zippers are also recessed within the shell to further mitigate water ingress. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Frapha-explore-bar-bag\">Explore Bar Bag</a> not only converts to shoulder carry but also works great as a hip pack, whether or not you’re on the bike. When not in use, the straps tuck away behind the Hypalon backing, staying quiet and invisible, albeit a bit fiddly to stuff back in there. If you’re looking for a versatile, virtually waterproof, and durable bag with a beautiful and understated aesthetic, the Explore Bar Bag is a great pick. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Frapha-explore-bar-bag\">Check Price at Backcountry</a><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18518&amp;awinaffid=723761&amp;campaign=&amp;clickref=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fshop%2Fexplore-bar-bag%2Fproduct%2FBBA03XXROR&amp;platform=pl\">Check Price at Rapha</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Falmsthre-compact-bar-bag-midnight-black-1.5l-195893515448%2Fp1420636\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tALMSTHRE Compact Bar Bag\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$55.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Volume</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>1.2 liters</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Dimensions</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>7.5” x 3.5” (19 x 8.9cm)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>158 grams</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Nylon Ripstop</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Water-resistant?</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes, water-resistant main body, waterproof zippers</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Color options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Midnight Black, Plum, Melon Green, Sunflower Yellow, Cosmic Blue, California Gold</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ALMSTHRE-Compact-Bar-Bag.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"752\" height=\"501\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ALMSTHRE-Compact-Bar-Bag.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Handlebar Bags of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ALMSTHRE-Compact-Bar-Bag.jpeg 752w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ALMSTHRE-Compact-Bar-Bag-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ALMSTHRE-Compact-Bar-Bag-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ALMSTHRE-Compact-Bar-Bag-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lovely appearance</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\"Hard-shell\" design retains shape</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Plenty of organization options</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Smaller size may limit usefulness for some riders</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Falmsthre-compact-bar-bag-midnight-black-1.5l-195893515448%2Fp1420636\">ALMSTHRE Compact Bar Bag</a> is the perfect size and shape for fast roads when you need just a bit of extra storage. As the word compact suggests, this is essentially just a smaller version of the Signature Bar Bag that has half the volume of its larger sibling but otherwise looks pretty much identical.</p><p></p><p>This barrel-shaped bag is an inch smaller in diameter than the Signature Bar Bag but it has the same “hard-shell” construction, so it holds its shape perfectly and has ample rigidity to make opening and closing the main zipper nice and easy. It’s made with a tough water-resistant nylon material with waterproof zippers, so it fends off light showers, road spray, and mud with ease. The quality construction and hard-shell design combine with the adjustable attachment straps and elastic tether cord to make the Compact Bar Bag impressively stable in use. The handlebar straps can also be adjusted laterally with two positions to suit your needs.</p><p></p><p>The 1.2-liter volume is on the smaller side but is perfect for conveniently holding essentials like a phone, nutrition, gloves, or a packable layer in arm’s reach while freeing up your jersey pockets. The main compartment holds the bulk of the volume and features an internal mesh pocket to help keep things organized. On the outside of the bag, a zippered pocket on one end and a mesh pocket on the other fit smaller items while a daisy chain on the front is available for clipping on a light for those twilight rides.</p><p></p><p>Available in six lovely colors, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Falmsthre-compact-bar-bag-midnight-black-1.5l-195893515448%2Fp1420636\">Compact Bar Bag</a> will coordinate easily with any bar tape or frame color. At $55, it’s $10 less than the Signature Bar Bag from ALMSTHRE but offers half of the storage space. We feel that the Compact Bar Bag is, therefore, a smart choice for riders who want to keep their load light, while preserving space around the bars for easy hand movement, and minimizing the aero penalty of using a bar bag. If that sounds like you, then this full-featured bag is a solid value that will keep your jersey pockets free, and your gear organized, while elevating the look of your bike’s cockpit area. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Falmsthre-compact-bar-bag-midnight-black-1.5l-195893515448%2Fp1420636\">Check Price at Performance Bike</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=14049&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fchromeindustries.com%2Fproducts%2Fhelix-handlebar-bag\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChrome Industries Helix\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$45.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Volume</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>3 liters</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Dimensions</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>9” x 6” x 3” (22.8 x 15.2 x 7.6cm)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>272 grams</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Proprietary tarp exterior, polyester</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Water-resistant?</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes, PFC-Free DWR treatment</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Color options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black, Fog</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Chrome-Industries-Helix.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"715\" height=\"477\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Chrome-Industries-Helix.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Handlebar Bags of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Chrome-Industries-Helix.jpeg 715w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Chrome-Industries-Helix-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Chrome-Industries-Helix-120x80.jpeg 120w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Tough material and robust build</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Easy to access</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lots of storage space</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Might not fit small bikes</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Significant aero penalty</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>A bit big for those with lower storage needs</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=14049&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fchromeindustries.com%2Fproducts%2Fhelix-handlebar-bag\">Helix Bar bag</a> is a large 3-liter bag built from durable “tarp” material according to Chrome Industries. It’s a tough bag that will keep the contents stable, quiet, and dry. While it can easily be mounted to drop or flat handlebars, Chrome designed the Helix to be equally useful off the bike. By deploying the stow-able cross-body strap that’s built into the bag, the Helix transforms into a mini messenger or hip pack. </p><p></p><p>The shape of the main compartment bag is better suited to carrying than proper road cycling for a couple of reasons. First, its boxy shape rests comfortably against your back but creates a significant amount of aerodynamic drag when mounted to the handlebars. Of course, all bar bags are going to cost a few watts of drag at speed, but with the Helix, it’s noticeable in real-time. Second, because the bag is 6 inches tall – about double the height of the typical bar bag – it could be a little too tall for smaller frame sizes (52cm and under) as the front tire could touch the bottom of the bag. </p><p></p><p>The Helix features a different zipper design than most bar bags. The zipper wraps around the upper edge of the bag and faces the rider, allowing the top to open wide for clear and easy access to all contents. We liked this for adding and removing items while at a stop, but while moving, the Helix lacks the structure to allow for one-handed opening and closing of this wrap-around style zipper. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=14049&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fchromeindustries.com%2Fproducts%2Fhelix-handlebar-bag\">Chrome Helix</a> is a great bag for the right situation, but that’s something other than a fast-paced road ride. For riders who are commuting or cruising around town, and want to be able to take their gear with them off the bike, the Helix is a great option. It could hold a huge camera, a handful of cold beverages, or loads of packable clothing. At $45, it’s an inexpensive way to keep a lot of gear organized on days when your adventures involve not only cycling but also spending some time on foot. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=14049&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fchromeindustries.com%2Fproducts%2Fhelix-handlebar-bag\">Check Price at Chrome Industries</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07LFVMHBP/?tag=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVVTFQNB/?tag=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag-20\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRockbros Bike Handlebar Bag\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$21.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Volume</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>2 liters</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Dimensions</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>9” x 3.5” (22.8 x 9cm)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>216 grams</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Polyester</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Water-resistant?</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Color options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black, Dark Green</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rockbros-bike-handlebar-bag.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"995\" height=\"663\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rockbros-bike-handlebar-bag.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Handlebar Bags of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rockbros-bike-handlebar-bag.jpeg 995w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rockbros-bike-handlebar-bag-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rockbros-bike-handlebar-bag-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rockbros-bike-handlebar-bag-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rockbros-bike-handlebar-bag-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rockbros-bike-handlebar-bag-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Very inexpensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Nice material</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Converts to shoulder carry</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Might be too wide for 40c or narrower handlebars.</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Handlebar strap attachment points sag a bit</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVVTFQNB/?tag=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag-20\">RockBros Bike Handlebar Bag</a> is a midsized handlebar bag, with a storage capacity of 2 liters, perfect for holding everything you need but don’t want to stuff into jersey pockets. It’s easy to install with a three-point attachment system with buckled straps. At 9.5” in length, the RockBros Bike Handlebar Bag is on the wider side of things, best for bars of at least 42cm or wider. </p><p></p><p>As it does not use any internal reinforcement, the Bike Handlebar Bag can be easily folded up to store when needed. RockBros also includes a shoulder strap that can attach to the Bike Handlebar Bag and convert it to a shoulder bag for off-bike carry. An elastic cord on the front of the bag can be used to lash additional items when the main compartment is already full. Additionally, you’ll find one small mesh side pocket to organize small items like earbuds or used snack wrappers. </p><p></p><p>While RockBros shows the handlebar bag as able to mount vertically to the seatpost or along the frame top tube, we found that in both these positions the bag wasn’t stable and constantly interfered with our legs while pedaling. When mounted to the handlebar, however, stability is relatively good, and noise is kept to a minimum.</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVVTFQNB/?tag=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag-20\">Rockbros Handlebar Bag</a> is available in Black and Dark Green, both colorways feature classic woven fabric that will age gracefully and conceal the inevitable smudges and dust that collect on handlebar bags when used in wet or dusty conditions. While it isn’t quite as refined as any of the other models we tested, at $21, it’s half the price of the next least expensive option, making it an affordable choice for the infrequent user or the rider on a super tight budget.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVVTFQNB/?tag=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Comparison Chart</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Handlebar Bag</th><th>MSRP</th><th>Volume</th><th>Dimensions</th><th>Weight</th><th>Water-Resistant?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=23377&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ornotbike.com%2Fproducts%2Fhandlebar-bag-ecopak-white%3Fvariant%3D46328906907940\">Ornot Handlebar Bag</a></td><td>$86</td><td>3.1 liters</td><td>8.5″ x 5.4″</td><td>261 grams</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://leadoutgear.com/products/lead-out-mini-handlebar-bag/\">Lead Out!

Long rides, short rides, road, gravel, mountain, we love being out there. We also love being prepared for whatever may come our way, whether we’re out for an hour or the entire day. Being prepared means having everything we need to stay comfortable, nourished, and ready to fix mechanical issues that may arise, so we need space to keep all of the important things with us. More recently, handlebar bags have become one of our favorite ways to keep our essential items close at hand wherever our rides take us. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For our handlebar bags buyer’s guide, we called on the expertise of Bennett Shane to test and compare a diverse selection of the best handlebar bags on the market. Bennett has been cycling seriously for over two decades and spends an inordinate amount of time on the bike while riding for fitness, fun, and lots of product testing. He lives just outside of Portland, Oregon, and enjoys both long and short rides throughout the countryside and mountains of the Pacific Northwest (and everywhere else for that matter). Living in an area with highly variable weather and often embarking on half to full-day rides in the mountains means that he often needs to carry lots of gear, food, and tools to be prepared for changing temperatures and weather while remaining self-sufficient. Since it isn’t always possible, or comfortable, to stuff everything into jersey pockets, Bennett relies on handlebar bags to expand his on-bike storage capabilities and keep essentials close at hand. Having owned and used many different handlebar bags over the years, Bennett has unique insight into this growing category of products. Bennett also has loads of experience testing and reviewing other products like <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-handlebar-tape/\">handlebar tape</a>, cycling shoe covers, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-winter-cycling-gloves/\">winter cycling gloves</a>, road bike shoes, cycling bibs, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-helmets/\">road bike helmets</a>, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After researching the best handlebar bags on the market, we gathered 19 different models for testing and side-by-side comparison. Our diverse selection includes a range of sizes, brands, and price points, with models suitable for any type of riding or storage need. After examining the materials and construction of each model, Bennett mounted them up on his small fleet of road bikes, loaded them with jackets, gloves, snacks, phones, cameras, keys, and more, and hit the road. Over the course of several months, Bennett rotated through these handlebar bags on his daily rides while assessing each model’s storage, attachments, stability, zippers, ease of use, weather resistance, and all-around performance in real-world riding conditions. When testing concluded, we zeroed in on our favorites and those that excel for specific reasons compared to the rest. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1708\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Handlebar-bag-testing-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Bennett Shane testing handlebar bags\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Handlebar-bag-testing-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Handlebar-bag-testing-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Handlebar-bag-testing-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Handlebar-bag-testing-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Handlebar-bag-testing-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Handlebar-bag-testing-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Handlebar-bag-testing-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Handlebar-bag-testing-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /><figcaption>Bennett Shane tested all of the handlebar bags in this review on road rides throughout the Pacific Northwest.

While many bar bags share a similar barrel-like shape, sizes, materials, and constructions vary such that some are likely to suit your needs better than others. For instance, some are impressively weather-resistant while others are simple but effective canvas. Some use internal reinforcement to hold their shape, while others offer less structure and thereby shed weight. Many offer a host of features like external pockets, as well as straps for attaching lights and securing lightweight clothing while others are more simple. We’ll break down important factors to consider when choosing a handlebar bag below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wizard-works-lil-presto-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Closing the zipper on the Wizard Works Lil Presto Handlebar bag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wizard-works-lil-presto-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wizard-works-lil-presto-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wizard-works-lil-presto-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wizard-works-lil-presto-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wizard-works-lil-presto-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wizard-works-lil-presto-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wizard-works-lil-presto-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wizard-works-lil-presto-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /><figcaption>Modern handlebar bags like the Wizard Works Lil Presto are good-looking, functional pieces of equipment that can ensure you’re prepared and organized on every ride.

Thankfully, handlebar bags come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and storage capacities to meet different storage needs and wants. We tested 19 different models with nearly all of them having capacities ranging between 1.15 and 3.4 liters (with one outlier at 5 liters), which are all great options for adding a bit of extra storage to your bike for everyday rides. Of course, with those different capacities come varying dimensions which will impact how they fit and how much space they take up on your handlebar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Capacity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The storage capacity or volume of handlebar bags is typically expressed in liters and sometimes in cubic inches. The bags we tested range between 1.15 liters on the smaller end and up to 5 liters on the larger side of the spectrum. What size works best for you will depend on what you’re intending to carry in it. Of course, this may vary depending on the length of your ride, the weather conditions, or the season, so for some riders, having more than one handlebar bag to suit varying needs may be necessary. For others, finding a versatile size that works most of the time is the best bet. And, in addition to a handlebar bag’s stated capacity, other storage features like external mesh or zippered pockets can effectively increase their capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ALMSTHRE-compact-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"The ALMSTHRE Compact Bar bag mounted on a road bike handlebar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ALMSTHRE-compact-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ALMSTHRE-compact-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ALMSTHRE-compact-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ALMSTHRE-compact-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ALMSTHRE-compact-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ALMSTHRE-compact-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ALMSTHRE-compact.jpeg 2048w\" /><figcaption>Smaller capacity bags like the 1.2-liter ALMSTHRE Compact easily fit the essentials, don’t weigh much, and take up little real estate on the handlebar.

We tested eight models between 1.7 and 2.4 liters with most of them falling at or closer to 2 liters of storage. These bags fall into what could be called the “goldilocks” zone where they are neither too big nor too small, instead, they are “just right”. These bags easily accommodate everything you can fit into the smaller models while having enough additional space to squeeze a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-jackets/\">packable jacket</a> for variable weather and/or more snacks to keep you fueled on longer rides.

While 3 liters is by no means huge, it is quite a bit of storage space and plenty for most riders to tackle all-day rides and carry everything they need without being prohibitively large or heavy. These bags will allow you to bring multiple layers, larger food items, or even bigger cameras. The four bags in this size range are the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=23377&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ornotbike.com%2Fproducts%2Fhandlebar-bag-ecopak-white%3Fvariant%3D46328906907940\">Ornot Handlebar Bag</a>, Swift Industries Bandito, <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=25977&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.angrycatfishbicycle.com%2Fproduct%2Fwizard-works-lil-presto-barrel-bag-31342.htm%3Fvariations%3D468797%2C605132%3Futm_source%3Dgoogle%2520shopping%26utm_medium%3Dorganic%26srsltid%3DAfmBOopJjNxkORqcYZbeS3MnjTioMt7DMOs77WXlzSjnyDC796jOccY_BdI\">Wizard Works Lil Presto</a>, and the Chrome Helix.

You could easily fit several Burritos in there, but all that storage results in a bag that takes up much more space on the handlebar.

As storage volume increases, so do the dimensions of the bag. Eleven of the models we tested share a barrel shape and have measurements for their length and circumference. The remaining eight models have more of a rectangular (or flattened oval) shape that include measurements for length, height, and width. Many of the barrel-shaped bags have rigid internal structures that help them retain their cylindrical shape which prevents them from sagging and helps keep them more stable, even when they aren’t full. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Handlebar-bag-dimensions-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding with the Lead Out!

(photo/Ben Guernsey)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to consider the dimensions of a handlebar bag as it may impact how well it fits on your handlebar and whether or not it conflicts with your hand positions. Depending on the shape and width of your handlebars, some bags might be too wide/long. The models we tested range between 7 and 11 inches in length, with most of them falling between 7.5 and 9.5 inches. It’s worthwhile to have a friend measure the space between your hands in these positions, so you can use the measurements provided in this guide to choose a bag that is ideally sized for you and your bars. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Onot-Handlebar-bag-mini-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"A closer look at how handlebar bags attach with the Ornot Handlebar Bag Mini\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Onot-Handlebar-bag-mini-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Onot-Handlebar-bag-mini-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Onot-Handlebar-bag-mini-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Onot-Handlebar-bag-mini-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Onot-Handlebar-bag-mini-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Onot-Handlebar-bag-mini-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Onot-Handlebar-bag-mini.jpeg 2048w\" /><figcaption>A closer look at the Ornot Handlebar Bag Mini demonstrates the typical attachment method of handlebar bags with two bar straps and a tether cord. (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Attachment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most handlebar bags attach to the handlebars in a similar way although there are slight variations on the theme. The typical bar bag attachment system includes two straps that loop around the handlebar on both sides of the stem along with an elasticized tether cord that loops around the headtube or stem to anchor it and add some stability. The handlebar straps on some bags are fixed in position, while others have multiple attachment points that allow you to position them optimally for your cockpit setup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While they all achieve the same goal, different brands use different handlebar strap types to attach bags to the bars. Some use hook and loop (velcro) straps, others use nylon webbing straps with plastic buckles, and some use rubber (Voile-style) straps. They all work in relatively the same way, although some make it a little easier to install and remove a bag and some are more grippy and stable than others. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Blackburn-Grid-Handlebar-Bag-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"The Blackburn Grid Handlebar Bag with straps positioned close to the stem\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Blackburn-Grid-Handlebar-Bag-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Blackburn-Grid-Handlebar-Bag-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Blackburn-Grid-Handlebar-Bag-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Blackburn-Grid-Handlebar-Bag-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Blackburn-Grid-Handlebar-Bag-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Blackburn-Grid-Handlebar-Bag-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Blackburn-Grid-Handlebar-Bag.jpeg 1890w\" /><figcaption>Many bar bags, like the Blackburn Gird pictured here, allow you to adjust the position of the handlebar straps to have them closer to the stem or wider out on the bar tape. (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on whether you have accessories like lights or a computer mounted on your bars, or where you place your hands on the bar tops, having the option to adjust the position of the attachment straps may be worthwhile. If, for example, the space immediately next to your stem is already cluttered with computer and/or light mounts, it’s nice to be able to move the straps out and have them over your <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-handlebar-tape/\">handlebar bar tape</a>. Conversely, if you want all the space possible for your hands on the bar tops, moving the straps closer to the stem can give your thumbs more room.

Mini Bar Bag should keep its contents dry in most situations. (photo/Ben Guernsey)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Water Resistance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the weather conditions you ride in, water resistance may or may not be a deciding factor in your handlebar bag choice. Fortunately, there are plenty of options that are highly water resistant (some even claim to be “weatherproof”) and are made with DWR-treated fabrics, water-resistant linings, waterproof zippers, or all of the above. While few bags claim to be completely waterproof, there are many that are pretty darn close, like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18561&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmissionworkshop.com%2Fproducts%2Ftoro-handlebar-bag%3Fvariant%3D40249969279085\">Mission Workshop Toro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Frapha-explore-bar-bag\">Rapha Explore Bar Bag</a>, and several others. These can typically fend off showers, road spray, and mud with ease while keeping your precious cargo nice and dry. Others have simpler constructions that aren’t quite as water-resistant but will usually fare well against super light amounts of moisture. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ornot-mini-reflective-detail-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"The reflective detail on the front of the Ornot Mini Handlebar Bag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ornot-mini-reflective-detail-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ornot-mini-reflective-detail-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ornot-mini-reflective-detail-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ornot-mini-reflective-detail-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ornot-mini-reflective-detail-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ornot-mini-reflective-detail-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ornot-mini-reflective-detail.jpeg 2048w\" /><figcaption>It’s small, but the reflective strip on the webbing on the front of the Ornot Mini is better than nothing and may improve your chances of being seen. (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reflectives</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some brands and models of handlebar bags have reflective elements added to them to add a bit of visibility in low-light conditions. While we don’t feel it is a requirement, and most of the bags we tested don’t have them, we do appreciate reflective features when they are added to an accessory like a handlebar bag if it increases our chances of being seen by motorists. The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebarbag&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fblackburn-grid-handlebar-bag\">Blackburn Grid</a> is a standout for its reflectivity as the entire front face of the bag lights up when hit with a headlight. Some other models have reflective strips integrated into the front-facing webbing like on the models from Ornot and Rapha. Many bags also have daisy chain-style webbing attachment points where clip-on lights can be attached for those rides where you’re flirting with darkness.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Lowland-Crafts-Bar-Bag-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"The handmade Lowland Crafts Handlebar Bag can be ordered in custom colors.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Lowland-Crafts-Bar-Bag-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Lowland-Crafts-Bar-Bag-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Lowland-Crafts-Bar-Bag-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Lowland-Crafts-Bar-Bag-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Lowland-Crafts-Bar-Bag-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Lowland-Crafts-Bar-Bag-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Lowland-Crafts-Bar-Bag.jpeg 2048w\" /><figcaption>Handlebar Bags give you the opportunity to express your personal style. The handmade Lowland Crafts bag is made to order and you have the option to choose the colors for a custom look. (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Style</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While many riders probably don’t think of a handlebar bag as a fashionable accessory, there are plenty who do, and it is one of many ways to easily and affordably add some personal flair to your bike. Some handlebar bags only come in one or a few safe color options like black or grey which are easy to coordinate with just about any bike, while others are available in a range of colors. ALMSTHRE, Orucase, Mission Workshop, and Wizard Works offer some of the most color options among the models we tested. <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/1623123895/bike-handlebar-bag?click_key=a5af1f13ff28dba1e46177ecc1f37a5b257b1026%3A1623123895&amp;click_sum=39ce856b&amp;ref=search_recently_viewed-1&amp;frs=1&amp;variation0=4101239154&amp;variation1=4121212003\">Lowland Crafts</a> is unique in regards to style since these bags are handmade to order and the buyer is given the option to choose the main fabric, front panel, and attachment webbing colors when purchasing. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Value</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to many things in cycling, handlebar bags are a relatively inexpensive accessory. That said, they come at a range of prices with the majority of the models we tested training between $40 and $125. In general, the larger the bag, the more expensive it is, and vice versa. Still, some of these seemingly simple little bags cost a little more than you might expect. One of the reasons is that many of the brands that make handlebar bags (like Wizard Works, Swift Industries, Road Runner, and Mission Workshop) are quite small, produce in small batches, use recycled fabrics, and/or make their products in the USA where costs are higher. All those factors make the price go up, but should also correlate to added value with long-term durability thanks to quality materials and constructions.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ornot-Handlebar-Bag-with-gear-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Pulling a pair of cycling gloves out of the Ornot Handlebar Bag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ornot-Handlebar-Bag-with-gear-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ornot-Handlebar-Bag-with-gear-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ornot-Handlebar-Bag-with-gear-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ornot-Handlebar-Bag-with-gear-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ornot-Handlebar-Bag-with-gear-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ornot-Handlebar-Bag-with-gear-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ornot-Handlebar-Bag-with-gear-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ornot-Handlebar-Bag-with-gear-720x480.jpg 720w\" /><figcaption>You can easily expand your on-bike storage with the right handlebar bag.

There are several reasons that people choose to use one including convenience. The handlebar-mounted position keeps your ride essentials like a phone, camera, snacks, gloves, etc., within arm’s reach in a place that can be easily accessed when stopped or even while riding. They offer additional storage capacity that can be used to hold items that you might normally carry in a jersey pocket which can enhance your comfort by freeing up your lower back and reducing the need to awkwardly reach back to your jersey pockets to access them. They also come in a range of shapes, sizes, and colors, so you can get one that meets your specific needs for storage and suits your personal aesthetic. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>What size handlebar bag do I need?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Handlebar bags come in a range of sizes to suit varying storage needs and choosing the right size really comes down to figuring out what you want to store in it. If you need something to simply hold your phone, nutrition, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-winter-cycling-gloves/\">cycling gloves</a>, credit card, and keys on your everyday rides, then a lower-capacity bag (1.2 liters or so) like the Ornot Mini, Orucase Smuggler, Lead Out Mini, Blackburn Grid, and ALMSTHRE Compact bar bags are all great choices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your storage needs are slightly greater and you need space for all the previously mentioned essentials plus things like arm warmers or a light jacket, then a medium-capacity bag (around 2 liters, give or take) provides a little more flexibility to fit more gear for longer rides or variable weather conditions. For those who frequently head out for all-day epics or like to be super prepared with <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-jackets/\">packable cycling jackets</a>, a camera, a sandwich, you name it, the larger capacity packs (3 to 5 liters, or more) will readily accept more cargo. And, for those with greater storage needs, like bikepackers, for example, there are lots of even larger options to carry even more gear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you don’t always need to fill a larger handlebar bag to its capacity either, so they can work quite well for smaller loads, just with a slight weight and aero-penalty compared to smaller options. When in doubt, we suggest erring on the slightly larger side rather than ending up with a bag that is too small. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>There are lots of options on this list, which one should I get?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>There are lots of great handlebar bags on the market, so you’ve got a lot of options. We tested 19 different models, and there are plenty of others to choose from as well. Realistically, they all work pretty darn well, so choosing the best one for your needs comes down to getting one that’s the right size, meets your demands for weather resistance, and organizes your gear, snacks, etc., in a way that appeals to you. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\n<div>\n\t<h2>Related Content</h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article>\n\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-handlebar-tape/\">\n\t\t<img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Handlebar-tape-lead-image.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Handlebar Tape of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Handlebar-tape-lead-image.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Handlebar-tape-lead-image-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Handlebar-tape-lead-image-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Handlebar-tape-lead-image-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Handlebar-tape-lead-image-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Handlebar-tape-lead-image-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Handlebar-tape-lead-image-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Handlebar-tape-lead-image-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/buyers-guides/\">Buyers Guides</a></div>\n\n<h2>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-handlebar-tape/\">\n\t\tThe Best Handlebar Tape of 2024\t</a>\n</h2>\n\n<div>\n\t<p>Handlebar Tape is an often overlooked upgrade that can greatly improve your relationship with your bike.
