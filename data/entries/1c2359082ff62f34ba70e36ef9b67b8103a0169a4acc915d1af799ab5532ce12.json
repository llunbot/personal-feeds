In a statement to <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/613307/netflix-apple-tv-app-support-mistake\">The Verge</a></em>, a Netflix spokesperson confirmed that temporary support for the Continue Watching feature was an error, and it has been rolled back.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNetflix is one of the only major streaming services that has refused to offer integration with the ‌Apple TV‌ app, preferring instead for customers to manage watch lists and browse for content directly in the Netflix app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNetflix has never supported integration with the built-in content tracking feature in the ‌Apple TV‌ app, so ‌Apple TV‌ users are not able to see Netflix shows and movies in their watchlists. Content from ‌Apple TV‌+, Hulu, Disney+, Max, Amazon Prime Video, and other services can be tracked with the ‌Apple TV‌ app across Apple devices, but that is not the case for Netflix.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/\">Netflix</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/netflix-no-apple-tv-integration/\">Netflix Isn't Adding Apple TV Integration After All</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-isnt-adding-apple-tv-integration-after-all.2449388/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1c2359082ff62f34ba70e36ef9b67b8103a0169a4acc915d1af799ab5532ce12","category":"Apple"}
