Discovery (WBD) over their plans to launch a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/02/new-streaming-app-from-fox-disney-wbd-is-about-more-than-sports/\">unified sports streaming app</a>. Fubo, a live sports streaming service that has business relationships with the three companies, claims the firms have engaged in anticompetitive practices for years, leading to higher prices for consumers.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to understand how much potential the allegations have to derail the app's launch, Ars Technica read the 73-page sealed complaint and sought opinions from some antitrust experts.

Pricing hasn’t been confirmed but is expected to be in the $30-to-$50-per-month range. Fubo, for comparison, starts at $80 per month for English-language channels.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005093#p3\">Read 34 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005093&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4814a5761a80ab5cc9f48760e5494f6546609c9ce87a056a8dc5b3eb8257250f","category":"Tech"}
