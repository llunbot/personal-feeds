The researchers created a website with technical details about the so-called <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/Gazeploit/\">\"GAZEploit\"</a> vulnerability.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn short, the researchers said that a person's gaze typically fixates on a key they are likely to press next, and this can reveal some common patterns. As a result, the researchers said they were able to identify the correct letters people typed in messages 92% of the time within five guesses, and 77% of the time for passwords.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/dan-persona-vision-pro.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe researchers disclosed the vulnerability to Apple in April, according to the report, and the company addressed the issue in visionOS 1.3 in July. The update suspends Personas when the Vision Pro's virtual keyboard is active.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple added the following entry to its <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/120915\">visionOS 1.3 security notes</a> on September 5:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<blockquote><strong>Presence</strong>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAvailable for: Apple Vision Pro\r<br />\n\r<br />\nImpact: Inputs to the virtual keyboard may be inferred from Persona\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDescription: The issue was addressed by suspending Persona when the virtual keyboard is active.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCVE-2024-40865: Hanqiu Wang of University of Florida, Zihao Zhan of Texas Tech University, Haoqi Shan of Certik, Siqi Dai of University of Florida, Max Panoff of University of Florida, and Shuo Wang of University of Florida</blockquote>The proof-of-concept attack was not exploited in the wild, according to the report. Nonetheless, Vision Pro users should immediately update the headset to visionOS 1.3 or later to ensure they are protected, now that the findings have been shared publicly.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/\">visionOS 2</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/12/vision-pro-persona-typing-security-vulnerability/\">Apple Fixes Vision Pro Security Flaw That Could Expose What You Typed</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-fixes-vision-pro-security-flaw-that-could-expose-what-you-typed.2436088/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6b9e27c45fe2f4391715f41238ec6065b7af2e2e212e415dd65d380cb5db9a14","category":"Apple"}
