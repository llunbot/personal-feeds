Tianma doesn't currently make any displays for existing Apple products, with the company usually opting for the likes of Samsung Display, LG Display, and BOE.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a></em> adds that Taiwan's Radiant Optoelectronics will handle backlight module production, while China's BYD will be the sole assembly partner.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe device was originally rumored launch in early 2024, but faced repeated delays, initially to late 2024.
