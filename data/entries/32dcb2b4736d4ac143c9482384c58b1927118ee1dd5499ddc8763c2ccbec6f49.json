{"title":"Why Trump’s Tariffs Are Rattling Even Meta","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/technology/trump-tariffs-meta.html","date":1743788614000,"content":"\n<p>Mike Isaac, writing for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple, Dell, Oracle — which rely on hardware and global supply\nchains that are in the direct line of fire from tariffs — saw\ntheir shares go into free-fall. But there was another big tech\ncompany whose stock took a pummeling even though its core business\nhas little to do with hardware: Meta. [...]</p>\n\n<p>The effect of tariffs on Meta’s ad business is simple. Many of\nits small and medium-sized advertisers are from all across the\nworld. President Trump’s tariffs will instantly make it more\nexpensive for them to sell their products to customers in the\nUnited States. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Last year, the company disclosed that 10 percent of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/business/google-meta-temu-shein.html\">its revenue in\n2023 was from Chinese companies spending heavily</a> on advertising\nacross Facebook and Instagram, an ad blitz aimed at garnering a\nfoothold in lucrative Western markets.</p>\n\n<p>Much of that growth was fueled by the explosive expansion of the\nfast-fashion company Shein — which is based in Singapore but has\na supply chain that is largely in China — and the e-commerce app\nTemu, a low-cost, Amazon-like company owned by the Chinese\ne-commerce conglomerate Pinduoduo. Temu was estimated to have\nspent $3 billion in marketing costs in 2023 alone, according to\nestimates from Bernstein Research.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When the stock market began crumbling after Trump’s announcement Wednesday, I didn’t get why Meta was being hit so hard. Meta makes devices, but unlike Apple, that’s just a side hustle. Meta isn’t a retailer like Amazon. But Meta <em>is</em> a huge advertising destination for retailers. It’s all interconnected.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/04/trump-tariffs-meta\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"32dcb2b4736d4ac143c9482384c58b1927118ee1dd5499ddc8763c2ccbec6f49","category":"Tech"}
