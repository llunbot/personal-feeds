It’s about 33 miles with around 3,000 feet of climbing, and tons of twisty, fast, and fun gravel roads to explore. And the occasional peak through the trees at the Blue Ridge Mountains.”</p><p>We always love seeing photos from where you are riding and are happy to share them with our readers around&nbsp;the world here on the Pic Of The Day.
