Kevin Tofel's <a href=\"https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/chromeos-116-may-begin-the-lacros-browser-push-to-chromebooks/?expand_article=1\">About Chromebooks</a> has spotted flags that turn on the feature by default for ChromeOS 116 and up. 116 is currently <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-116-beta/\">in beta</a> and should be live in the stable channel sometime this month.</p>\n<p>The project is called \"<a href=\"https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/lacros.md\">Lacros</a>\" which Google says stands for \"<strong>L</strong>inux <strong>A</strong>nd <strong>C</strong>h<strong>R</strong>ome <strong>OS</strong>.\" This will split ChromeOS's Linux OS from the Chrome browser, allowing Google to update each one independently. Google documentation on the project says, \"On Chrome OS, the system UI (ash window manager, login screen, etc.) and the web browser are the same binary. Lacros separates this functionality into two binaries, henceforth known as ash-chrome (system UI) and lacros-chrome (web browser).\" Part of the project involves sprucing up the ChromeOS OS, and Google's docs say, \"Lacros can be imagined as 'Linux chrome with more Wayland support.'\"</p>\n<p>Previously ChromeOS was using a homemade graphics stack called \"<a href=\"https://iwf1.com/chrome-os-implements-a-new-home-made-graphics-stack-named-freon-ditches-x11\">Freon</a>,\" but now with Wayland, it'll be on the new and normal desktop Linux graphic stack. Google's 2016 move to Freon was at a time when it could have moved from X11 (the old, normal desktop Linux graphics stock) directly to Wayland, but it decided to take this custom detour instead. Google says this represents \"more Wayland support\" because Wayland was previously used for Android and Linux apps, but now it'll be used for the native Chrome OS graphics, too.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958381#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958381&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3f3ba64ea191aa2e7399f6b726dc490de835348b74b2f0b509efaa5742f68fa8","category":"Tech"}
