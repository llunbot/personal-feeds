CAD drawings of the upcoming ~11-inch and ~13-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ models give us some insight into just how thin the tablets will be.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/11-inch-ipad-pro-2024.jpg\" width=\"3729\" height=\"1269\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/11-inch-ipad-pro-2024-thickness.jpg\" width=\"1120\" height=\"188\" /><em><div>11-inch 2024 ‌iPad Pro‌</div></em>\r<br />\nCAD drawings of unreleased Apple devices often leak out of Apple's factories in China and other countries because the information is so valuable to case makers. Case makers use these measurements to design cases for new products in order to be the first to market with a protective case for a new device size.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/13-inch-ipad-pro-2024.jpg\" width=\"3832\" height=\"1316\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/13-inch-ipad-pro-2024-thickness.jpg\" width=\"1178\" height=\"124\" /><em><div>13-inch 2024 ‌iPad Pro‌</div></em>\r<br />\nPreviously leaked dimensions confirmed that the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/\">OLED iPad Pro</a> models will be significantly thinner than the current versions. The larger ‌iPad Pro‌, for example, will be over 1mm thinner.\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n<li>Current 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ - 247.6mm x 178.5mm x 5.9 mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>Upcoming ~11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ - 249.7mm x 177.5mm x 5.1mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>Current 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ - 280.6mm x 214.9mm x 6.4mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>Upcoming ~13-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ - 281.5mm x 215.5mm x 5.0mm</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nOLED displays will bring improved HDR, better colors, deeper blacks, and other quality improvements. Apple has so far limited OLED technology to the Apple Watch and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, so this will be the first time that OLED displays have been available in an Apple device of this size.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's ‌iPad Pro‌ models are also expected to be upgraded with faster 3-nanometer M3 chips, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> charging is a possibility. Apple is also expected to sell the devices with a new Magic Keyboard and an upgraded <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>, with full details <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/\">available in our OLED iPad Pro guide</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/2024-ipad-pro-cad-drawings/\">OLED iPad Pro's Thin Design Highlighted in CAD Drawings</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/oled-ipad-pros-thin-design-highlighted-in-cad-drawings.2420679/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b453c18327672575f39efbc346c49d1b6bd09e2a1cedc2ba0cd238f65cd3a0a4","category":"Apple"}
