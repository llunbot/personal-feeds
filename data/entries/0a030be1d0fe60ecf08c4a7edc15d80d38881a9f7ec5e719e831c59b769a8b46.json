For a few years, we felt the wind of\nFacebook, Twitter, and Pinterest at our backs, and we did\njournalism that treated those sites as the front page of the new\ninternet. At first, we celebrated and immersed ourselves in an\noptimistic web culture that imagined a reader who cared about\nwhich Disney princess she was, and also the <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexcampbell/this-battered-woman-wants-to-get-out-of-prison\">worst</a> of how\nthe American justice system treated abused women, who wanted to\nargue about the color of <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/catesish/help-am-i-going-insane-its-definitely-blue?utm_term=.wnrMEoO6y#.agDJKQPRB\">the dress</a> and also understand the\n<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/virginiahughes/science-of-the-dress\">science</a> behind it. That was back when all of it mixed up\nin your Facebook feed, and it felt novel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>BuzzFeed News did great work and employeed some terrific reporters, but they <em>never</em> had a plan to turn a profit that made any more sense than that of <a href=\"https://observer.com/2016/01/the-cautionary-tale-of-south-parks-underpants-gnomes/\">the underwear-collecting gnomes</a> on <em>South Park</em>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/20/buzzfeed-news-shutting-down\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0a030be1d0fe60ecf08c4a7edc15d80d38881a9f7ec5e719e831c59b769a8b46","category":"Tech"}
