With GC battles set to begin from the very start, thanks to the hilly opening stages in the Basque region, it is expected to be another gripping edition as the riders battle it out for the prestigious yellow jersey. </span></p>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>This year’s route is focused on the mountains, taking in the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Jura, and the Vosges via the Massif Central. There is also a record-breaking 30 classified climbs, including the legendary Col du Tourmalet, Col d’Aspin, and Col de la Loze. A climber’s paradise, the route only features one 22km time trial and includes no cobblestones (as we saw in the 2022 Tour de France), dirt road stage, or team time trial. </span></p>\n<p><span>Anything can happen in three weeks of racing, and whoever arrives in Paris donning the yellow jersey will have a career-defining moment as they win the biggest race in the sport. Last year’s winner Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) will be back to defend his title. But two-time winner Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates) is determined to have the yellow jersey back on his shoulders. </span></p>\n<p><span>However there are also other riders looking to achieve their own Tour goals, namely Mark Cavendish (Astana Qazaqstan), who is hunting a stage win. It is not just any stage win though – it's a stage win that’ll see him become the all-time record holder for the most stage wins at the Tour, sitting above the legendary Eddy Merckx. </span></p>\n<p><span>With all this on the cards, cycling fans will be keen not to miss a moment, and there are places where you can catch every single second of the Tour on a subscription, as well as free-to-air coverage.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/ZW-02462.jpg?v=1687427191\" alt /></span></p>\n<h3>How to watch the 2023 Tour de France in the UK</h3>\n\n<p>The Tour de France will be live-streamed for free in the UK on Eurosport, ITV4 and Welsh channel S4C, with a highlights show in the evening rounding up the day's action.
