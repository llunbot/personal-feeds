Doyle had to cover the bar when\nhis coworker was hauled out by police in handcuffs.</p>\n\n<p>And that’s how Doyle, 79, a married father of two and grandfather\nof four, came to be the longest-serving bartender at Philly’s\noldest-operating bar. This month marks 50 years for Doyle at\n<a href=\"https://mcgillins.com/history/\">McGillin’s</a>, which opened on Drury Street near 13th in 1860,\nand in true Philly fashion, the bar is throwing a yearlong party\nin his honor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you ever visit McGillin’s — and you should if you can — their exclusive <a href=\"https://mcgillins.com/beer-list/\">McGillin’s 1860 IPA</a> is the beer to order. Good food too. Back when I was in college they had some sort of ridiculous Friday night wings special — 100 wings for $10? — that never ceased to seem too good to be true.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/28/bartender-john-doyle-mcgillins\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"78c3127d21b484eb01766db07baf7a4d082964e012a88d4b919748cad8838e94","category":"Tech"}
