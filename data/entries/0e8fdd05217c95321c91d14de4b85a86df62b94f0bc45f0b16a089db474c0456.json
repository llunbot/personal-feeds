Even banking websites frequently offered unencrypted connections! Thankfully, the web-encryption landscape has changed dramatically in the 11 years since then.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798812#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798812&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0e8fdd05217c95321c91d14de4b85a86df62b94f0bc45f0b16a089db474c0456","category":"Tech"}
