Well, if you live in California’s San Fransico Bay Area, Friiway might have a solution for you. Partnering with premium eBike companies like Stromer and Riese &amp; Müller, Friiway is announcing that they are now offering premium eBike subscriptions in the Bay Area. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Friiway (pronounced free-way), is hoping that their combined efforts with Stromer will help this program be a catalyst for positive change. Through this eBike subscription service, they aim to reshape urban landscapes and reduce carbon footprints. In turn, it could build a sense of togetherness that transcends city limits. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-hero-e1698102394248.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"336\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-hero-e1698102394248-800x336.jpeg\" alt=\"Friiway Premium eBike Lease hero\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-hero-e1698102394248-800x336.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-hero-e1698102394248-297x125.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-hero-e1698102394248-120x50.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-hero-e1698102394248-768x322.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-hero-e1698102394248.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo c.

America. “<em>Leasing has been a great success for us in Europe, making our top-of-the-line eBikes available to more commuters.” </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rajakylä continues to say, “<em>On top of that, many employers are now taking advantage of this model to support their employees </em>toward <em>healthier, more affordable, and more sustainable ways of commuting</em>. <em>We’re excited to expand these opportunities in the United States.” </em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who is Friiway</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Friiway was founded in 2023 by Joe Connors and Brett Thurber and is the first service in the U.S. to offer subscriptions of premium eBikes. They do this through local retailers, making the bike available on a month-to-month basis. There is no need to commit to purchasing the eBike to take advantage of the program. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, insurance and maintenance are built into the lease, every Friiway bike is covered against theft and damage. If you need repairs on the bike, that’s covered too, by the Friiway retailer. You can even apply 15% of the subscription to a bike purchase at your local Friiway retailer if you fall in love.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-girl-riding.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-girl-riding.jpeg\" alt=\"Friiway Premium eBike Lease girl riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-girl-riding.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-girl-riding-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-girl-riding-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-girl-riding-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-girl-riding-768x576.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Friiway’s co-founders, Brett Thurber, says, “<em>Local service is essential to support eBikes as vehicles that replace cars, and local business is also crucial for building a vibrant cycling culture and community</em>.” He continued, “<em>When developing Friiway we decided that working with local bike shops would be fundamental.”  </em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-the-New-Wheel-Retailer.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-the-New-Wheel-Retailer.jpeg\" alt=\"Friiway Premium eBike Lease the New Wheel Retailer\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-the-New-Wheel-Retailer.jpeg 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-the-New-Wheel-Retailer-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-the-New-Wheel-Retailer-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-the-New-Wheel-Retailer-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-the-New-Wheel-Retailer-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Friiway-Premium-eBike-Lease-the-New-Wheel-Retailer-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://newwheel.net/\">New Wheel</a> is the brick-and-mortar customer service hub that Friiway has partnered with.
