Instead of providing a sample immediately, the athlete went for a ride while agreeing to stay within sight of the anti-doping official. Before long, however, the athlete reportedly went out of sight on rural roads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After an hourlong ride, the athlete provided the requested sample.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report did not name the athlete involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Mail on Sunday, an unnamed former anti-doping official called the circumstances “truly troubling,” and said that the incident should have been documented. Further details of what happened are unknown and the UK Anti-Doping Agency reportedly said that “test paperwork from 2012 was subject to a retention period of 18 months.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report came less than a week after WADA said that it had found that British Cycling had violated regulations by engaging in its own drug-testing program in 2012. A WADA investigation known as Operation Echo looked into allegations that British Cycling had tested samples from elite riders for nandrolone “as part of a study into potential contamination of supplements,” according to the WADA statement. “Contrary to the rules laid down by the World Anti-Doping Code and the relevant International Standard, the samples were collected by British Cycling staff rather than doping control officers, analyzed by a non-WADA-accredited laboratory, and provided by the athletes on the basis that UKAD would never know the results.”</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/10/report-british-cyclist-put-off-doping-test-to-go-for-ride-ahead-of-2012-olympics/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"1914ae40700be8fda6f98f4fbcf1e12423db00c824b34023743a87b1c9284af0","category":"Cycling"}
