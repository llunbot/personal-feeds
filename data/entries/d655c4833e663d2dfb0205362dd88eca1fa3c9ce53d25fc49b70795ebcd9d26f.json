Next up the World Championships and a potential Triple Crown – can Pogačar join that elite club of Eddy Merckx and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-power-of-three-stephen-roche-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Roche</a>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We sat down with Pogačar as he recced the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/uci-road-cycling-world-championships-route-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">Worlds</a> course in Zurich and took on a charity bike ride for PlumeStrong, for whom he is ambassador. We discuss his rivalry with Jonas Vingegaard; why he secretly hates wearing the yellow jersey; what he makes of Remco Evenepoel; the pivotal moments at this year’s Tour; whether his performances make him the GOAT (or if not, what more he needs to do); how he manages to stay so relaxed; and, most importantly, what he eats for breakfast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This episode also has a bonus interview with tech billionaire and cycling fanatic, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/fahri-diner-plumestrong-interview-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Fahri Diner</a>. Fahri co-founded and runs Plume, the tech company behind the PlumeStrong foundation and the PlumeStrong Cycling Challenge. We talk to Fahri about staying focussed, why cycling is necessary for the soul, plus how to run a tech company, a charitable enterprise and keep up with Tadej Pogačar, all the at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interview begins at 10:31</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/cyclist-magazine-podcast/episodes/115-tadej-pogaar-on-the-tour-his-rivals-being-relaxed-and-pl\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 114 now on Acast</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\">all episodes</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This episode is brought to you by Tredz, the online and bricks and mortar bike shop run by real riders, for real riders.
