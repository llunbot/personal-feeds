Among other things, it sought to make sure that devices from disparate companies using differing technologies (like Wi-Fi or Zigbee) could reliably work together in some way or another.</p>\n<p>We went over the specifics of the technologies used in the standard <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/12/apple-google-and-amazon-team-up-for-joint-smart-home-standard/\">when it was first announced in 2019</a>. It was previously slated to arrive before the end of 2021. This isn't the first time the standard has been delayed, however; it was originally planned for late 2020.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787039#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787039&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"550e8a248fb213c638b1062d7274f39873bf766dd4a0139a30ec9c0ead930060","category":"Tech"}
