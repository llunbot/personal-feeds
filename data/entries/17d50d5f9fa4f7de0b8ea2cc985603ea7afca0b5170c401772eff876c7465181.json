When not in use, bikes make for an awkward object to store in the house, taking up space and being easy to knock over.</p>\n<p>Some of us may be fortunate enough to have space to leave a bike or bikes on the floor – in a rack or not. But many will need to resort to clever solutions to maximise space and create a tidier option.</p>\n<p>A garage is a luxury most cyclists can only dream of. If you are lucky enough to have one and security is a concern, check out our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-lock/\">best bike locks</a>.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the best bike storage ideas for keeping your bike indoors, in a shed or outside.</p>\n<h2>Best bike storage ideas in 2023</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Without a proper storage solution, things can get ugly pretty quickly.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oliver Woodman/Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>There are many permanent bike storage solutions that mount to walls or ceilings, but if you’re renting this could prove problematic.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, we’ve divided our guide into two distinct sections – permanent and non-permanent – with permanent options needing to be bolted or screwed in place.</p>\n<p>Here, we’ve focused on functional and readily available solutions. But remember that a trip to the hardware store and a little ingenuity is always an option.</p>\n<p>Also, for many people, the floor remains the cheapest and most suitable path. Axle and wheel racks are readily available, which will keep the bikes upright.</p>\n<h3>Permanent storage solutions for bikes</h3>\n<p>This is a good route if you own your home and have a solid wall or ceiling that can support weight and fixtures.</p>\n<p>Permanent racks are generally the cheapest option and allow for a great deal of tweaking to suit your fleet of bikes. We’ve designated permanent racks simply by the orientation they hold the bike: vertical or horizontal.</p>\n<h3>Vertical wall-mounted bike racks</h3>\n<p>Holding the bike by a single wheel, this method is best for storing bikes where width is an issue, but depth is not. It’s the most effective means of storing multiple bikes together, taking up less room than horizontal racks, and is commonly used in many bike shop workshops.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Generic hooks can be bought cheaply at hardware stores, but Park Tool offers these vertical hooks in a range of sizes that’ll even accommodate fat bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy - Park Tool</i></span></div>\n<p>The simplest variations consist of a basic hook that threads into a masonry wall plug or screws directly into a wooden wall post or ceiling beam.</p>\n<p>These are readily and cheaply available from hardware stores, although the bike-specific versions from the likes of Park Tool do offer greater wheel-size compatibility, including options for fat bikes and other large <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike/\">mountain bike</a> rubber.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Pro Bike Rack (left) and Delta Cycle Leonardo (right) are popular choices and take the basic vertical wheel hook one step further.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy</i></span></div>\n<p>More advanced and secure options include those that bolt to the wall with multiple points of attachment and feature a built-in backing plate, such as models from Pro, Delta, Topeak and X-Tools to name a few.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> If you’re looking for a permanent vertical hook, the SteadyRack comes at a premium but is superb.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy - Steadyrack</i></span></div>\n<p>Racks such as the <a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/gear/category/accessories/bike-storage-systems/product/review-steadyrack-classic-bike-rack-47958/\">SteadyRack</a> hold the outside of the wheel and won’t mark the rim.</p>\n<p>Its unique design enable you to swing the bike nearly 180 degrees to get access to others or have the bike sit closely against the wall. The downside? This rack isn’t cheap, especially if you want more than one.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Horizontal wall-mounted bike racks</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This rack from IceToolz is an example of a basic permanent horizontal rack.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy - IceToolz</i></span></div>\n<p>If vertical storage is best for when width is an issue, horizontal storage is ideal for when depth of space is the concern.</p>\n<p>Generally holding the bike underneath the top tube, this method requires more horizontal wall space.</p>\n<p>Basic options include foldable hangers that bolt to the wall, with more expensive options taking the design concept further and creating something that is visually appealing.</p>\n<p>Brands such as Feedback Sports offer models with adjustable hooks to fit a variety of frame shapes, while other brands offer racks that double as shelves.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Ceiling-mounted bike racks</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bicycle hoist systems are handy if you’re looking to store bikes in roof space.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy - RAD Cycle Products</i></span></div>\n<p>For those with plenty of ceiling or wall space out of easy reach, there’s the hoist system.</p>\n<p>They’re commonly found in hardware stores to be used for items such as ladders and kayaks, but also work well with a bicycle.</p>\n<p>Generally, they are best for people who see cycling as an occasional pastime, rather than a lifestyle; it’s not the quickest system to use and installation is more involved than mounting a fixed hook or bracket.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Keeping bikes vertical reduces the floor space taken up and can enable you to store things beneath them.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James Costley-White / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Something like the Stashed SpaceRail allows you to hang multiple bikes from your ceiling, with a modular design that allows you to add more bikes to the set-up in the future.</p>\n<p>The hooks allow the bikes to be spun around meaning you can alternate their direction to store them closer together.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Non-permanent indoor storage solutions for bikes</h3>\n<p>Perhaps you’re renting or just not keen on drilling into things. If so, these non-permanent rack solutions are for you.</p>\n<h3>Ceiling-to-floor rack for bikes</h3>\n<p>The most common type of non-permanent off-the-floor rack is the pole type that clamps between floor and ceiling.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Ceiling-to-floor racks are a strong solution for rental properties. The Feedback Sports Velo Column (left) and Topeak Dual-Touch (right) are both great options.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy</i></span></div>\n<p>Most common examples are the <a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/gear/category/accessories/bike-storage-systems/product/review-feedback-sports-velo-column-storage-48628/\">Feedback Sports Velo Column</a> and Topeak’s Dual-Touch. The Velo Column is a little more stylish, but the Topeak offers a firmer hold against the ceiling.</p>\n<p>These use either a spring or hinge to lock in place, but can easily be removed if needed. Generally, these racks will hold two bikes, with the option to hold a further two with aftermarket kits.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Wall-leaning racks for bikes</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> If you’re after a simple wall-leaning rack, Delta Cycle has you covered.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy - Delta Cycle</i></span></div>\n<p>Wall-leaning solutions are less common, with racks from Delta Cycle being a rare example of bike storage that simply props against a vertical surface.</p>\n<p>They look nice and are beyond simple to install, but aren’t suitable for use on slippery floors.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Free-standing racks for bikes</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Free-standing bike stands come at a price, but the Feedback Sports Velo Cache (left) and Topeak TwoUp (right) are solid options.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy</i></span></div>\n<p>Brands such as Thule, Feedback Sports and Topeak offer free-standing bike storage, also known as ‘bike trees’. These simply use a weighted or tripod base to offer a pole to hang bikes from.</p>\n<p>While not as clean-looking as a ceiling-to-floor rack, they may be a better option for people whose homes don’t have a solid ceiling or those who need a solution that can be moved at a moment’s notice.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Other methods of storing your bike indoors</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Gear Up’s Off the Door rack, which simply hangs off a door, is an option for renters short on space.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oli Woodman / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Gear Up’s Off the Door rack is just like a permanent vertical hook, but simply slips over the top of a door and uses the bike’s weight to hold it in place.</p>\n<p>Opening the door could be an issue in some locations, though.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Bike box/shed</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A proper bike storage box is worth considering.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Allen / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If you have a suitably large garden or secure outside space, you can also consider <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cheap-bike-sheds/\">a dedicated bike shed/box</a>. These are usually smaller and harder to break into than a regular shed.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/accessories/bike-storage/bike-storage-systems/asgard-gladiator-metal-bike-shed-review/\">Asgard Gladiator metal bike shed</a> is an excellent example.</p>\n<p>If you already have a shed, be sure to check out our article on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/improve-your-bike-shed-security-whatever-your-budget/\">how to improve your shed security to deter thieves</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<p>It’s a (very) good idea to consider <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bicycle-insurance-guide/\">insuring your bike</a> if you’re going to be storing it inside, outside or away from home.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://insurance.bikeradar.com/bicycle-quote/?id=8ec66f5594855effef74fc9ac570fbc8\" target=\"_blank\"><div>\n    <img width=\"2560\" height=\"622\" alt title /></div></a></p>\n<h2>Storage security issues</h2>\n<p>This is another factor that may affect your storage decision. Depending on where you plan to keep your bike, you may need to consider a lockable rack solution.</p>\n<p>Some of the rack types mentioned above, especially the permanent versions, often offer slots for a cable or D-lock. Most of the non-permanent racks will be difficult to secure.</p>","author":"David Rome","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"17d50d5f9fa4f7de0b8ea2cc985603ea7afca0b5170c401772eff876c7465181","category":"Cycling"}
