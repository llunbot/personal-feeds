Here's everything that's new.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iPad-mini-6-vs-7-Feature-1.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nAt the core of the new device is the A17 Pro chip, first introduced last year in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> Pro, which delivers faster CPU and GPU performance along with advanced graphics features like hardware-accelerated ray tracing. One of the most important additions is support for Apple Intelligence, unlocking new AI-driven features that could dramatically improve user experience. It's also worth noting that the device now starts with 128GB of storage, double the previous base capacity, with no increase in price. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe seventh-generation ‌iPad mini‌ also boasts a faster USB-C port for quicker data transfers, Smart HDR 4 for better photo quality, and support for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> Pro with hover functionality for greater precision. A new Blue color also replaces Pink in the lineup.

The most significant change is the move to the A17 Pro chip, which brings a notable performance boost across the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine. This improvement is important for power users who rely on their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> for demanding tasks such as creative work or intensive multitasking. The addition of hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading also enhances graphics performance, which is ideal for mobile gamers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Intelligence support is another major feature that introduces a wide array of AI functionalities such as notification summaries, writing tools, image and emoji generation, and a revamped version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> that integrates ChatGPT and on-screen awareness and the ability to take action. This could be transformative for those who use their ‌iPad‌ for productivity.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe seventh-generation ‌iPad mini‌ also gains ‌Apple Pencil‌ hover and ‌Apple Pencil‌ Pro support, offering more precise control for drawing, writing, and graphic design. These upgrades make the new ‌iPad mini‌ particularly attractive for artists and professionals who use the ‌Apple Pencil‌ extensively. The new USB-C 3.0 port offers twice the data transfer speed of the sixth-generation ‌iPad mini‌, making it a meaningful upgrade for users who frequently transfer large files between devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe improved Smart HDR 4 for photos and new True Tone flash enhances camera performance. While not revolutionary, it's a good improvement for those who use their ‌iPad mini‌ for photography and document scanning. Finally, the fresh Blue color adds a subtle aesthetic update, but of course, this is a matter of personal preference.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you're a power user—someone who relies on their ‌iPad‌ for heavy multitasking, professional work with the ‌Apple Pencil‌, or intensive graphics and gaming—the seventh-generation ‌iPad mini‌'s improvements in speed, Apple Intelligence support, and Pencil support could make a noticeable difference to your workflow and justify an upgrade.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor users intending to use their ‌iPad mini‌ for browsing, light productivity, streaming, and casual gaming, the improvements in the seventh generation may not feel as impactful. The core experience of iPadOS and apps will remain largely the same, with only moderate gains in speed and efficiency. If the sixth-generation ‌iPad mini‌ still handles all your needs—especially if you don't push it to its performance limits—the improvements in the seventh generation might not feel essential.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe A15 Bionic chip is still more than capable for everyday tasks, and unless you require faster data transfers, better ‌Apple Pencil‌ control, or Apple Intelligence for productivity, the new features may not justify the cost of upgrading. If you are one of these users and you do not currently own an ‌iPad mini‌, it may be worth picking up a now-discontinued sixth-generation model for a heavily discounted price. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-6-vs-7/\">iPad Mini 6 vs. iPad Mini 7 Buyer's Guide: 20 Upgrades Compared</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-mini-6-vs-ipad-mini-7-buyers-guide-20-upgrades-compared.2440120/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"16154e89d848e09319613b49d66b368b0b0dddfe92e4386149f70e0632d1b2ac","category":"Apple"}
