However, BleepingComputer \nhas learned there is more to this attack, with threat actors \nselling the stolen accounts for as little as $0.50 per account, \nallowing purchasers to use stored credit cards to make illegal \npurchases. [...] </p>\n\n<p>The company says that once an account was breached, it allowed \nthreat actors to change the information on the account, including \npasswords, email addresses, and shipping addresses. This \neffectively locked a user out of the account, allowing the threat \nactors to make purchases using stored credit card information \nwithout the legitimate account holder receiving order \nconfirmation emails. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/11/roku-tos\">More good news</a> for Roku users, including the fact that <a href=\"https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/e9cc298b-379b-47ba-a10d-e2263963b574.shtml\">Roku first discovered the hack in early January</a>, and waited until now to notify affected users.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/13/roku-hack\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b05f85e18a7ba74162e77df87c3c3ec93e65c0c50ae7b786e0294b2ac5cfaf9f","category":"Tech"}
