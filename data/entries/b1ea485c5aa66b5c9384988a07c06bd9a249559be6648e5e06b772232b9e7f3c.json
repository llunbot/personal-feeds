mechanical road bike groupset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Shimano</i></span></div>\n<p>With Shimano having not launched a new mechanical <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/road-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">road bike groupset</a> since the 11-speed <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/shimano-105-r7000-r7020-groupset-review/\">105 R7000</a> in 2019, some were <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/future-of-mechanical-groupsets/\">lamenting the apparent demise of high-end mechanical groupsets</a>.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, though, it seems Shimano hasn’t forgotten about those who prefer mechanical drivetrains.</p>\n<p>In fact, Shimano is pitching 105 R7100 at those “looking for reliable, easy-to-maintain componentry at an affordable price”.</p>\n<p>It also cites a key advantage of mechanical groupsets over electronic ones – you’ll never need to charge it or worry about battery levels.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Shimano 105 R7100 mechanical groupset\" title=\"Shimano 105 R7100

groupset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Shimano</i></span></div>\n<p>Given 105 R7100 shares all non-shifting components with its Di2 cousin, the gearing options and ranges are identical.</p>\n<p>As with Shimano’s other 12-speed groupsets, 105 R7100 cassettes stick with an 11t smallest cog and retain compatibility with existing 11-speed Shimano HG freehub bodies.</p>\n<p>Shimano is coy on whether there have been any specific improvements to shifting speed or quality, compared to the previous-generation, 105 R7000 groupset.</p>\n<p>When pressed on the subject, it simply said “R7100 adheres to Shimano’s own high standards for shifting performance”.</p>\n<h2>Shimano 105 RD-R7100 rear derailleur</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n

The Shimano 105 R7100 rear derailleur is offered with a single, medium-length cage.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Shimano</i></span></div>\n<p>The part that sees the most significant update is the new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/a-complete-guide-to-rear-derailleurs/\">rear derailleur</a>.</p>\n<p>Shimano doesn’t list any specific improvements to shifting speed or quality for the RD-R7100 rear derailleur, but the headline new feature is it can shift across 12, rather than 11, cassette cogs.</p>\n<p>Visually, it departs from the previous RD-R7000 rear derailleur, gaining a flattened body and the same 105 branding from the Di2 R7150 rear derailleur.</p>\n<p>The derailleur cage has also been updated, although this part isn’t a straight port from the Di2 version – with the mechanical cage appearing to have more material cut from the outer plate, perhaps shaving off a few more grams.</p>\n<p>As with 105 Di2 R7150, Shimano has dropped a short-cage rear derailleur option, offering just a single, medium-length derailleur cage instead.</p>\n<p>As a result, the RD-R7100 rear derailleur is compatible with 11-34 and 11-36t Shimano HG cassettes.</p>\n<p>Officially, the RD-R7100 rear derailleur isn’t compatible with the tighter 11-30t cassettes available at the Ultegra or Dura-Ace level.</p>\n<p>The RD-R7100 rear derailleur has a claimed weight of 249g and costs £59.99/$64.99/€61.99.</p>\n<h2>Shimano 105 FD-R7100 front derailleur</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n

The new 105 R7100 front derailleur sees only minor changes compared to its 11-speed predecessor.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Shimano</i></span></div>\n<p>As with the rear derailleur, Shimano isn’t claiming any particular improvements to shifting performance for the new FD-R7100 front derailleur.</p>\n<p>The FD-R7100 isn’t a direct port from the previous-generation groupset, however, because Shimano says it has been updated to work “perfectly” with the new 11-36t cassette option.</p>\n<p>There are some minor aesthetic changes too.</p>\n<p>Officially, it’s only compatible with the 50-34 and 52-36t chainring combinations Shimano offers at the 105 level.</p>\n<p>Shimano claims a braze-on FD-R7100 front derailleur weighs 96g and it costs £41.99/$46.99/€49.99.</p>\n<h2>Shimano ST-R7120

identical in form to their 11-speed predecessors, though there are subtle changes to the lever ergonomics.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Shimano</i></span></div>\n<p>Shimano says the new mechanical shift and brake levers have been updated to work with the 105 BR-R7170 hydraulic disc brake calipers (which launched with 105 Di2 R7150).</p>\n<p>These calipers have 10 per cent wider pad spacing compared to the outgoing BR-R7070 ones, as well as the updated bleed port location on the outward-facing side of each caliper.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n

shape of the hoods, brake levers and shifter paddles is practically identical at a glance, for example.</p>\n<p>For its part, Shimano says ergonomics have been “refined”, while the brake lever action is now “lighter” and “smoother” than before.</p>\n<p>Shimano also says the lever reach – the distance from the handlebar or brake hood to the brake lever – has been reduced, though it hasn’t specified by how much.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Shimano 105

267g.</p>\n<p>Together, they cost £599.98/$709.98/€639.98.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting these weights don’t account for brake hoses or gear cables and housing, however.</p>\n<h2>Shimano 105 FC-R7100

href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cranksets/\">Bolt Circle Diameter</a> (BCD).</p>\n<p>It’s available with two chainring combinations, 50-34 and 52-36t, and five <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/what-is-the-best-crank-length-for-cycling/\">crank length</a> options – 160, 165, 170, 172.5 and 175mm.</p>\n<p>The FC-R7100 crankset costs £159.99/$179.99/€182.99, and is claimed to weigh 754g (50-34t, no crank length given).</p>\n<p>When we <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/shimano-105-di2-weight/\">weighed our 105 Di2 R7150

the cassette is also ported straight from the 105 Di2 groupset.</p>\n<p>It features 12 cogs and there are two ranges available – 11-34 and 11-36t.</p>\n<p>The cogs use Shimano’s Hyperglide shaping, which is claimed to improve shift quality, but don’t get the Hyperglide+ tech (an evolution of the Hyperglide cog shaping that’s claimed to improve shifting speed by a third), as seen on the latest Ultegra and Dura-Ace cassettes.</p>\n<p>The cassettes are compatible with 11-speed Shimano HG freehubs, and Shimano claims an 11-34t cassette weighs 361g (the 11-34t cassette we received with 105 Di2 weighed 360g).</p>\n<p>The 11-34t cassette costs £69.99/$65.99/€76.99, but the 11-36t option is a little more expensive at £84.99/$87.99/€99.95.</p>\n<h2>Shimano SM-RT70 brake rotors</h2>\n<div>\n
