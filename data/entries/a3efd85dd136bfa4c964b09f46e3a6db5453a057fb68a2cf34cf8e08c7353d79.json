The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Magnetic-Foldable-Wireless-Portable/dp/B09NRG4GK3/?th=1\">Anker 633 Magnetic Battery is down to $40</a>, a 31% discount from the $55 MSRP, while the MagGo Power Bank that also allows users to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Officially-Certified-Compact-Battery/dp/B0CZDFL2BY/?th=1\">charge their Apple Watch is available for $65 with Prime</a>, a savings of $15 on its usual $80 MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the first one is a tiny gadget that you can magnetically attach to your iPhone and wirelessly charge your device. Alternatively, you can plug in a USB-C cable and enjoy 20W charging. The coolest part about it is that it also comes with a kickstand, so you can prop your phone up while it’s charging to watch videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The newer Anker MagGo power bank comes with a flippable charger for your Apple Watch. You can either leave that down if you’re on the go or flip it open if you’re at your desk. It also comes with a built-in cable that you can plug into your phone for 30W charging. That same cable goes into a wall plug when the power bank needs a recharge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both battery packs feature a 10,000mAh capacity, while the prices aren’t all that different either. Ultimately, it depends on whether or not you need to charge both your iPhone and your smartwatch at the same time or not.
