But as reported <a href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/konami-is-set-to-revive-metal-gear-castlevania-and-silent-hill/\">by VGC</a>, it allegedly has several large-scale projects currently in production. Anonymous sources told the news site that a \"reimagining\" of <em>Castlevania </em>is being made internally in Japan with help from \"local external studios,\" while outside developers are working on new entries for <em>Metal Gear </em>and <em>Silent</em> <em>Hill</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Could it be true?</h2>\n<p>Beyond Konami proper, the <em>Metal Gear </em>project is alleged to be a remake of 2004's <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>, headed up by the Singapore-based outfit Virtuos. The auxiliary studio has recently worked on the Switch ports of <em>Dark Souls Remastered</em> and <em>The Outer Worlds, </em>and it otherwise offered development support in various capacities on hit series like<em> Uncharted, Call of Duty, </em>and <em>Battlefield</em>. (Last November, rumors began circulating that it was actually Bluepoint Games that was working on a remake of 1998's <em>Metal Gear Solid, </em>which continued until the studio <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/sony-acquires-its-most-prominent-remaster-studio-bluepoint-games/\">confirmed this week</a> its next project will be an original game.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1800174#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1800174&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Steve Haske","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"60ff71a7387d44e3bd8b0ac5a2b8bea4fd39c9708b901cdccf0c7d2f24ee94cc","category":"Tech"}
