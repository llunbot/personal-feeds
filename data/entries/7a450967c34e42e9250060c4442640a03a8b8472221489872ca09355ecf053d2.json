That means iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10 and Ultra 3, and iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS 15 Sequoia, and watchOS 11.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This September might be a little extra special, as we’re hearing about some new AirPods on the way and maybe a new iPad mini, too. On top of that, there are all the usual service releases for Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade. So strap in—here’s everything we expect Apple to release in September 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New hardware releases</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is set to release updates to some of its most popular products in September, with a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">special event planned for September 9 </a>(see <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673671/how-to-watch-apples-event.html\">how to watch the Apple event</a>). Here’s what’s on tap:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPhone 16:</strong> Larger screens for the Pro models, A18 processors, Apple Intelligence, new camera capabilities, a new Capture button, and more. This is going to be a big upgrade for a lot of people. Read <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">everything we know about the iPhone 16</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Watch Series 10:</strong> This may be called Apple Watch 10, X, or Series X, in honor of the 10th anniversary of Apple Watch (which was first unveiled on September 9, 2014) and looks to be the first significant design change ever. Rumors point to a larger display and a slimmer profile, with the possible addition of some new health sensors or features. Read what we know about the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2388593/apple-watch-series-10-display-size-dimensions-health-sensors.html\">Apple Watch Series 10</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Watch Ultra 3:</strong> The 3rd-gen Apple Watch Ultra is expected to be more or less the same as the current model, only with the same new processor (and maybe new sensors) found in the Apple Watch Series 10.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Watch SE 3:</strong> The 3rd-gen Apple Watch SE should resemble an Apple Watch Series 7, more or less. One rumor suggested Apple may use a rigid plastic chassis to trim costs and aim this model very much at kids/parents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AirPods: </strong>There are two sets of AirPods expected. One is a new entry-level model to replace the hopelessly outdated 2nd-gen AirPods, with a new design and USB-C case. The other is a mid-tier update to the 3rd-gen AirPods, which will get active noise canceling for the first time. New AirPods Max are supposedly not far off, but not rumored to be announced at this September event. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">Read more about the upcoming AirPods</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPad mini:</strong> This isn’t the first time we’ve heard that an iPad mini refresh is on the way. But the current model can’t support Apple Intelligence, which will be a big push for Apple, and the Apple stores and retailers are running out of stock on the current model without replenishing it—that usually points to an imminent upgrade. If the iPad mini does get an upgrade, we don’t expect much to change other than the processor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>September is also a huge month for software. Apple is set to release its yearly major updates of all its operating systems. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369986/apple-intelligence-siri-features-coming-after-ios-18-launch.html\">Apple Intelligence features won’t arrive until later updates</a>, starting with the point-1 releases in October, but there are still loads of great new features in the initial release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iOS 18:</strong> New Home screen customization options, an all-new Photos app, new features for Messages including RCS support, and much more. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-ai-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">Read all about iOS 18</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPadOS 18:</strong> You get all the features of iOS 18, including the awesome new Math Notes capability that really shines on the tablet. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2377675/ipados-18-superguide-features-release.html\">Read more about iPadOS 18</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‌<strong>tvOS 18:</strong> tvOS isn’t getting a major overhaul, just a few tweaks. There’s InSight, enhanced dialog support and subtitles, and a few new Home features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>macOS 15 Sequoia:</strong> With macOS 15 Sonoma, you’ll be able to mirror your iPhone to your Mac! There are a bunch of other nice features too, like the Passwords app, easier window tiling, a new calculator, and more. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">Read all about macOS 15 Sequoia here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Services</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple TV+</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the shows, series, and movies we expect to release on Apple TV+ in September.
