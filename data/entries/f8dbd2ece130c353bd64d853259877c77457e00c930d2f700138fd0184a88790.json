Apple created a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-has-six-artistic-logos/\">total of six logos</a> for the May 7 \"Let Loose\" event, and the interactive eraser cycles through those options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe event is expected to focus on new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> models, but rumors suggest the iPads will also be accompanied by an overhauled ‌Apple Pencil‌ and a refreshed version of the Magic Keyboard.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ios-17-5-apple-pencil-4-rumor/\">Code in iOS 17.5</a> mentions an ‌Apple Pencil‌ with a \"squeeze\" gesture, so it is possible that the new model that's coming will have a hardware-based erase option enabled with a squeeze. The current ‌Apple Pencil‌ models do not have a universal erase feature that works across apps, and adding such an option would likely be popular with users.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/\">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-homepage-erasable-logo/\">Erasable Logo on Apple's Homepage Hints at New Apple Pencil Coming Tomorrow</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/erasable-logo-on-apples-homepage-hints-at-new-apple-pencil-coming-tomorrow.2425535/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f8dbd2ece130c353bd64d853259877c77457e00c930d2f700138fd0184a88790","category":"Apple"}
