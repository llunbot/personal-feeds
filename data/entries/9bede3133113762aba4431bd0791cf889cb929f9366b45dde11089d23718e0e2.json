This is a significant delay over when the machine was originally expected to launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHe added that the next-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a> will likely not contain M2-series chips, with Apple postponing a refresh of the device until the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/\">M3</a> generation to avoid <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/26/apple-silicon-mac-pro-upgrade-limitations/\">cannibalizing the new Mac Pro</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman also said that the new 15-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, which will contain an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> chip, was originally supposed to launch last year. This apparently means that the 13-inch ‌MacBook Air‌ could run on a separate chip upgrade cycle to the 15-inch model, with the smaller device potentially set to receive the ‌M3‌ chip well before it comes to the larger model. How Apple plans to align the chip upgrade cycle of the two devices in the long term remains to be seen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFollowing up on an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/26/gurman-apple-headset-in-air-typing-for-text-input/\">earlier report</a>, Gurman said that he now expects the \"in-air typing\" text input method to be present on Apple's mixed-reality headset when it launches, despite its \"finicky\" experience. He added that the device's two-hour battery life may be likely to remain through successive generations of the mixed-reality headset, much like how the two standard Apple Watch model sizes have had no battery life improvements since their announcement in 2014.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor more of Gurman's latest thoughts on Apple's upcoming hardware announcements, listen to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/21/the-macrumors-show-mark-gurman-talks-wwdc-2023/\">latest episode of The MacRumors Show</a> on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/FlNbL8BoWUU\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/wwdc-2023-rumor-roundup-with-mark-gurman/id1602394741?i=1000610107178\">Apple Podcasts</a>, or your preferred podcast player.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/\">AR/VR Headset</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/\">The MacRumors Show</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/15-inch-macbook-air/\">15-Inch MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2023-mac-pro/\">2023 Mac Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio\">Mac Studio (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro\">Mac Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-glasses-ar-and-vr.209\">Apple Glasses, AR and VR</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237\">Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-pro.1\">Mac Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/21/no-apple-silicon-mac-pro-wwdc/\">Apple Silicon Mac Pro Reportedly Not Coming at WWDC, Mac Studio Refresh Likely Delayed Until M3</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-silicon-mac-pro-reportedly-not-coming-at-wwdc-mac-studio-refresh-likely-delayed-until-m3.2387432/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9bede3133113762aba4431bd0791cf889cb929f9366b45dde11089d23718e0e2","category":"Apple"}
