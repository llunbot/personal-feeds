The scale at the bottom shows that dark blue represents consumption between 1,000 TWh and 2,000 TWh.\n\nLet's look at each region systematically:\n\n1. North America: Canada is dark blue, indicating it consumes between 1,000-2,000 TWh from hydropower.\n2. South America: Brazil is dark blue, also consuming between 1,000-2,000 TWh.\n3. Europe: No country is dark blue; all are light green or have no data.\n4. Africa: No data available for any country.\n5. Asia: China is dark blue, indicating consumption between 1,000-2,000 TWh.\n6. Oceania: No country is dark blue; Australia is light green.\n\nIn summary, there are three countries that consume more than 1,000 TWh from hydropower in 2022:\n1. Canada (North America)\n2. Brazil (South America)\n3.

First, I'll examine the color scale at the bottom of the map. The darkest blue color represents consumption of 2,000 TWh or more.\n\n2.
