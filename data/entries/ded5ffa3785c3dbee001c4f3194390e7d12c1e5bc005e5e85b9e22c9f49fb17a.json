The new fork is stiffer. It’s also lighter at all spec levels, with refined offset to optimize modern handling. It even adds more user-adjustable travel for the top Pro level. And while not all snow riding demands suspension, damped front travel will expand your technical fat bike riding from choppy winter trails to summer beach riding, and plenty of trails in between…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Manitou Mastodon lightweight fat bike suspension fork</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_Borealis-beach-riding.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_Borealis-beach-riding.jpg\" alt=\"Manitou Mastodon lightweight fat bike suspension fork, sand riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_Borealis-beach-riding.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_Borealis-beach-riding-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_Borealis-beach-riding-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_Borealis-beach-riding-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_Borealis-beach-riding-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_Borealis-beach-riding-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Manitou Mastodon does everything the previous generation of the dedicated fat bike suspension fork did from -40° up to more humanly-manageable temperatures, just better. And now with an option for more travel too. Remember, you don’t need snow to have fun on a fat bike. We’ve been putting a Mastodon to beach cruising and dune duties this summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_winter-riding.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_winter-riding.jpg\" alt=\"Manitou Mastodon lightweight fat bike suspension fork, winter riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_winter-riding.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_winter-riding-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_winter-riding-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_winter-riding-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_winter-riding-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_winter-riding-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_winter-riding-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_winter-riding-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption><em>winter &amp; studio photos c. Manitou</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, for many people, it now comes at a cheaper price, as well. Manitou say they pride themselves on delivering Mastodon lightweight fat bike suspension forks built to take your adventure further. And while on the outside the new Manitou Mastodon looks almost exactly like the old fork, there’s plenty of updates tucked inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-Pro-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-Pro-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Manitou Mastodon Pro lightweight fat bike suspension fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-Pro-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-Pro-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-Pro-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-Pro-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-Pro-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-Pro-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-Pro-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first big deal is lighter weight. Manitou says the new lowers casting saves 106g for the new Pro or 120g for the new Comp (compared to their respective outgoing models). But both are stiffer too, thanks to extending the ribs from the Reverse Arch further down the legs of the lowers. The Pro-level Mastodon even gets 2cm of extra travel, now up to 160mm max, while the Comp still tops out at 140mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_dropping-in.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_dropping-in.jpg\" alt=\"Manitou Mastodon lightweight fat bike suspension fork, dropping in (to snow)\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_dropping-in.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_dropping-in-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_dropping-in-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_dropping-in-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_dropping-in-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_dropping-in-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_dropping-in-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another big shift is a new 44mm offset vs. the old 51mm. Manitou says they made the shift to better “<em>match modern geometry, transferring more weight onto the front wheel, and improving overall handling as a result.”</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The forks also drop the Standard vs. Extended designation, moving to an axle-to-crown length 6mm shorter than the previous Extended forks. But even with that, they retain the same max 26×5″ or 27.5×4.5″ tire clearance as the longer forks to fit every tire on the fatbike market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lastly, new cable routing around the front of the fork cleans up how the front brake line rounds the fork, especially important when you get into those longer travel settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech Details – Pro vs. Comp</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_angled-PRO-vs-COMP.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_angled-PRO-vs-COMP.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Manitou Mastodon lightweight fat bike suspension fork, PRO vs. COMP angled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_angled-PRO-vs-COMP.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_angled-PRO-vs-COMP-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_angled-PRO-vs-COMP-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_angled-PRO-vs-COMP-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_angled-PRO-vs-COMP-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_angled-PRO-vs-COMP-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The key differences between the Pro vs. Comp levels of Mastodons are hidden inside. But you can spot the Pro at a glance with its shiny silver crown vs. the all-black Comp fork. The Pro fork is 50g lighter with butted 7000-series alloy for the 34mm stanchions, vs. straight gauge 6000-series alloy for the Comp. The Pro also has a deeper hollow bore to the forged aluminum crown. Both do share the same Reverse Arch cast alloy lowers, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_PRO-COMP-specs.jpg\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_PRO-COMP-specs.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Manitou Mastodon lightweight fat bike suspension fork, PRO vs. COMP tech details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_PRO-COMP-specs.jpg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_PRO-COMP-specs-297x143.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_PRO-COMP-specs-800x384.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_PRO-COMP-specs-120x58.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_PRO-COMP-specs-768x369.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_PRO-COMP-specs-1536x737.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_PRO-COMP-specs-2048x983.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand inside, the Pro fork gets a premium Dorado Air spring and the Comp an Expert Air spring, both with internal Incremental Volume Adjust (IVA) to tune progression rate. Both can also be internally adjusted in 10mm travel increments. That means bike shops have fewer SKUs to keep in stock, but also that you can always add more or less travel down the road to refine your fatbike setup. The Mastodon Pro can now range from 80-160mm of travel, while the Comp can be set between 80-140mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_air-time.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_air-time.jpg\" alt=\"Manitou Mastodon lightweight fat bike suspension fork, snow airtime\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_air-time.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_air-time-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_air-time-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_air-time-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_air-time-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_air-time-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_air-time-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The damper adjustment knobs are also a bit different. Both levels of forks get external rebound and compression damping, but the Pro fork gets a simplified “<em>more intuitive</em>” top-tier VTT-6P damper while the Comp is a more basic ABS+ setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Manitou Mastodon – Pricing &amp; Options</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_PRO-or-COMP.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_PRO-or-COMP.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Manitou Mastodon lightweight fat bike suspension fork, PRO vs. COMP\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_PRO-or-COMP.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_PRO-or-COMP-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_PRO-or-COMP-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_PRO-or-COMP-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_PRO-or-COMP-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_PRO-or-COMP-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Manitou-Mastodon-lightweight-fat-bike-suspension-fork_PRO-or-COMP-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>2023 Manitou Mastodon  PRO (<em>l</em>) &amp; COMP (<em>r</em>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The revamped lighter Manitou Mastodon fat bike fork is available in two models, both in black.
