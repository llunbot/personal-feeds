{"title":"iCloud Advanced Data Protection Uptake Amongst DF Readers","link":"https://mastodon.social/@gruber/110901385373871344","date":1701817354000,"content":"\n<p>Back in August I ran a poll on Mastodon, asking my followers if they have <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/12/apple-advances-user-security-with-powerful-new-data-protections/\">iCloud Advanced Data Protection</a> enabled. iCloud Advanced Data Protection was announced two years ago this week, alongside support for security keys (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/\">Yubico</a>). The results, from 2,304 responses:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yes: 29%</li>\n<li>No: 59%</li>\n<li>No, but would if not for device(s) with old OSes: 12%</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Count me in that last group. I’ve got a handful of old devices that I still use which can’t be updated to an OS version that supports the feature. But one of these days I’ll just sign out of iCloud on those devices and enable this.</p>\n\n<p>As ever when I run <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/the_case_of_the_iphone_case_poll\">polls like this</a>, it should go without saying that the Daring Fireball audience is <em>not</em> representative of the general public. The results for this poll — with nearly 30 percent of responders having an esoteric security feature enabled — exemplify that.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/05/icloud-advanced-data-protection-uptake-amongst-df-readers\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2484b69b16f58909a0a80258f8082734cdd043642aef34e5d71b9cf4693a7260","category":"Tech"}
