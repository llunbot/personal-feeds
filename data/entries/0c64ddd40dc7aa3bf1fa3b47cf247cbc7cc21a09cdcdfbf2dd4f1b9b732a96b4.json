The name is similar to the ‌HomePod‌'s \"AudioAccessory\" identifier.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInterestingly, the 17,1 in the identifier name suggests that this device may receive Apple's upcoming A18 chip, which will be used in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/02/iphone-16-models-a18-chip/\">all four iPhone 16 models</a> later this year. With the A18 chip, the HomeAccessory device would have the power for Apple Intelligence. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe code also indicates that this \"home accessory\" will be running a software variant of tvOS, much like the ‌HomePod‌. Earlier this year, <em>MacRumors</em> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/tvos-17-4-homeos-mention/\">found evidence</a> of Apple's work on homeOS, which could be the firmware running on this device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn a similar note, the code also references two unreleased ‌Apple TV‌ models with the identifiers AppleTV14,4 and AppleTV14,5. Rumors suggest that an updated ‌Apple TV‌ could launch in 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce new iPhones, iPads, and potentially other products in September.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks <a href=\"https://x.com/nicolas09F9\">Nicolás Alvarez</a>!)</em><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/04/leak-confirms-apples-work-on-home-accessory/\">Leak Confirms Apple's Work On 'Home Accessory'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/leak-confirms-apples-work-on-home-accessory.2430688/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Aaron Perris","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0c64ddd40dc7aa3bf1fa3b47cf247cbc7cc21a09cdcdfbf2dd4f1b9b732a96b4","category":"Apple"}
