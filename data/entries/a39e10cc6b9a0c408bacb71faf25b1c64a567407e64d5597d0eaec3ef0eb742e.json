Available in carbon or allow, these posts make great enhancements to gravel or mixed surface bikes by reducing the chatter transmitted from the surface to the rider and can be tuned to rider weight through a simple elastomer change. #5 elastomer comes pre-installed, other weight elastomers <a href=\"https://canecreek.com/product/seatpost-parts-accessories/\" target=\"_blank\">sold separately</a>. They come in 27.2 and 31.6 mm options, fitting most gravel or mixed surface bikes and carry a max rider weight of 250lbs. </p>\n<p>See all the details at <a href=\"https://canecreek.com/product/eesilk-plus/\" target=\"_blank\">Cane Creek</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"a39e10cc6b9a0c408bacb71faf25b1c64a567407e64d5597d0eaec3ef0eb742e","category":"Cycling"}
