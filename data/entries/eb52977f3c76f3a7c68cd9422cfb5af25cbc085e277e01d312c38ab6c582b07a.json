In an interview with <a href=\"https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/man-muss-sachen-in-2-sekunden-erledigen-koennen-das-klingt-erst-mal-verrueckt-kurz-959818947913\">Swiss newspaper <em>Tages-Anzeiger</em></a> published today, Apple's VP of Technology Kevin Lynch and product marketing employee Deidre Caldbeck explained why.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Watch-Faces-watchOS-10-Feature-Iridescent.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe interview was spotted earlier by <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/19/interview-watchos-10-third-party-apple-watch-faces/\"><em>9to5Mac</em>'s Benjamin Mayo</a>, and the quotes below are machine translated from German.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLynch said Apple puts a \"huge amount of effort\" into every watch face to ensure they work \"uniformly and simply,\" and said Apple needs to plan ahead to make sure watch faces continue to work \"if we want to change something or add new possibilities.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCaldbeck added that developers are able to create complications for their watchOS apps, which adds a layer of customization to watch faces by allowing for glanceable information to be displayed, such as a CARROT Weather forecast. Starting with watchOS 10, the new Smart Stack widgets feature offers space for up to three complications.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThat's everything Apple had to say about the lack of third-party watch faces in the interview, which touches on several other watchOS 10 details.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nwatchOS 10 will be released later this year for the Apple Watch Series 4 and newer, and is currently available in beta for users with a free Apple developer account. A public beta is coming in July for users who do not wish to use the developer beta.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 8</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/19/watchos-10-still-lacks-third-party-watch-faces/\">Apple Explains Why Third-Party Watch Faces Still Aren't Supported on watchOS 10</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-explains-why-third-party-watch-faces-still-arent-supported-on-watchos-10.2393533/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"eb52977f3c76f3a7c68cd9422cfb5af25cbc085e277e01d312c38ab6c582b07a","category":"Apple"}
