The government is particularly interested in having Apple source components from domestic suppliers, suggesting this would create a \"multiplier effect\" for local employment.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's current <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/apple-ups-invest-offer-indonesia-iphone-16-ban/\">$100 million proposal</a> was a significant increase from its initial $10 million offer <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/indonesia-iphone-ban-apple-10m-investment/\">earlier this month</a>, and includes plans for research and development facilities and developer academies in Bali and Jakarta over a two-year period. The proposal also outlines plans to manufacture AirPods Max ear cup mesh components in Bandung starting July 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ongoing negotiations follow Indonesia's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/indonesia-bans-iphone-16-sales/\">October 28</a> ban on iPhone 16 sales, implemented after authorities determined Apple had not met the country's requirement for 40% domestic content in smartphones.
