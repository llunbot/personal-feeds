Banks have complained that Apple's exclusive access to the NFC contactless chip in its devices privileges ‌Apple Pay‌ over other payment systems.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn May 2022, the EU antitrust watchdog <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/02/eu-apple-pay-nfc-objection/\">officially objected</a> to Apple restricting rivals' access to its mobile tap-and-go technology, making it difficult for competitors to develop alternative mobile wallet services on Apple devices. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌Apple Pay‌ competitor PayPal and other rivals <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/03/paypal-eu-antitrust-complaint-apple/\">reportedly</a> played a role in the EU's decision to target Apple with antitrust complaints about its mobile wallet. The company was said to have filed informal complaints about the way Apple restricts third-party apps from accessing the NFC capabilities of the ‌iPhone‌, which led to the EC's Statement of Objections against Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe European Commission will now likely seek feedback next month from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept Apple's offer, according to people familiar with the matter who are cited in the report.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis is not the first time that Apple has faced criticism for restricting access to NFC on the ‌‌iPhone‌‌. Australian banks back in 2017 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/02/13/australian-banks-access-nfc/\">wanted access to NFC</a> in order to launch an alternative to ‌‌Apple Pay‌‌, but they were not successful.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/\">European Commission</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nfc/\">NFC</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/apple-offers-nfc-apple-pay-rivals-eu/\">Apple Offers iPhone NFC Chip Access to Apple Pay Rivals in EU</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-offers-iphone-nfc-chip-access-to-apple-pay-rivals-in-eu.2413474/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f134c1f8ed3f689cedc8debe6197f3d49ab43dd8f669a0814837f12a46fcf0ea","category":"Apple"}
