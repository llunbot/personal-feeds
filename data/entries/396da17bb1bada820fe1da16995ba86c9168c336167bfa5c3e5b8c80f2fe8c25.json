He will, however, face stiff competition from a number of riders, in particular Groupama-FDJ’s David Gaudu who finished above him at Paris-Nice, taking second overall.</p>\n<p>Pogačar will not be present, but his UAE Team Emirates will have a strong candidate for the overall victory in Adam Yates, the recent winner of the Tour de Romandie. There is also the double threat that Movistar pose with Enric Mas and Matteo Jorgensen. Ineos Grenadiers, meanwhile, have their Tour de France duo lining up: Dani Martínez and Carlos Rodriguez.</p>\n<p>The start list, further bolstered with Mikel Landa, Jai Hindley and Ben O’Connor, is five-star, and you can check out the entire startlist on the GCN+ app. It’s not just GC men, either. Though there are no clear-cut sprint stages on offer, the race has still attracted Dylan Groenewegen (Jayco-Alula) and Sam Bennett (Bora-Hansgrohe), and they will be among the Tour’s fastest men come July.</p>\n<p>The quality of the field is exceptional, and the parcours is explosive. All seven road stages could force major rejigs in the general classification, and stage four’s 31.1km time trial to Belmont-de-la-Loire finishes with shallow 12km climb will also result in sizeable time gaps. Find out about every detail of the route through the GCN+ app.</p>\n<p>You will want to make sure that you’re sitting comfortably for next Saturday’s stage seven that finishes atop the iconic Col de la Croix de Fer. The queen stage, the racing will be dramatic and full-on from the off, with the stage odometer totalling just 147km.</p>\n<p>One of the many great things of the Dauphiné is its ability to constantly test riders, and the mountainous terrain makes it essential that everyone is switched on. With so many GC teams sharpening their collective tools ahead of the Tour, and with so many riders wanting to deliver a psychological blow to their rivals just a few weeks out from their quest to win yellow, action can ignite at any time.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/1_79e19630-52d9-4289-9dc8-7eb0c770c568.jpg?v=1685637572\" alt /></div>\n<p>Fortunately, each and every stage will be shown live and ad-free on GCN+, with every kilometre broadcast into our homes or wherever we may be.
