It’s a simple but incredibly effective shift in tire construction that reshapes how an MTB tire can stick to the ground, even at higher pressure than before. At the same time, there’s an all-new Albert all-rounder that’s the face of this seismic radial shift in tire construction, in addition to another new soft-conditions tread &amp; a version of the classic Magic Mary with the new tech. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, both Trail &amp; Gravity versions of the groundbreaking new Radial casing make it a versatile option for aggressive trail riders to all-mountain riders, and especially to enduro &amp; DH racers. In fact, it’s already been raced to 9 World Cup DH victories including two wild wins by Amaury Pierron this year with massive time gaps.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-high-speed-testing-in-Finale.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-high-speed-testing-in-Finale.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Radial Trail Gravity mountain bike tires, Albert Gravity finale testing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-high-speed-testing-in-Finale.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-high-speed-testing-in-Finale-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-high-speed-testing-in-Finale-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-high-speed-testing-in-Finale-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-high-speed-testing-in-Finale-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-high-speed-testing-in-Finale-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-high-speed-testing-in-Finale-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Schwalbe)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This feels like a pretty big deal, getting extra grip almost for free.

Ultimately it’s a balance. Lighter construction and faster-rolling rubber dominate in XC. But pretty much every other mountain biker wants more grip. Softer rubber can only go so far, without just feeling slow or simply wearing too fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Just over a decade ago, Schwalbe significantly reduced the number of layers in their tires for more flexibility – with the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/schwalbe-teases-complete-range-of-gravity-tires-with-super-gravity-technology-weight-savings-27-5-sizes/\" target=\"_blank\">Super Gravity</a> carcass – but that also reduced puncture protection. Then almost immediately, they tried to drastically lower tire pressure – with the security of ProCore inside – but that didn’t prevent snakebites, reduced cornering stability, and was overly complicated. So the German tire engineers kept hunting for a solution that maximized the tire’s small contact patch touching the trail, without sacrificing support or reliability.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-Gravity-dropping-in-FInale.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-Gravity-dropping-in-FInale.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Radial Trail Gravity mountain bike tires, Albert Gravity in Finale\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-Gravity-dropping-in-FInale.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-Gravity-dropping-in-FInale-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-Gravity-dropping-in-FInale-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-Gravity-dropping-in-FInale-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-Gravity-dropping-in-FInale-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-Gravity-dropping-in-FInale-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-Gravity-dropping-in-FInale-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Schwalbe)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And they landed on Radial tires, or at least more radial…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is a Radial tire &amp; why do all bicycle tires use Bias-Ply construction?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_diagonal-vs-radial-construction.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_diagonal-vs-radial-construction.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Radial Trail Gravity mountain bike tires, bias-ply vs. more radial\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_diagonal-vs-radial-construction.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_diagonal-vs-radial-construction-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_diagonal-vs-radial-construction-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_diagonal-vs-radial-construction-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_diagonal-vs-radial-construction-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_diagonal-vs-radial-construction-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, radial tires (like in your car) have a main structure of fibers that go straight up the sidewall from the rim, straight across the tread, and straight down the other sidewall back to the rim. Radially from the center of the wheel/tire combo. They have great flex characteristics and a smooth ride but generally require stiff belts of tough fibers (or steel) to support the tread.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_thread-angles-comparison.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_thread-angles-comparison.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Radial Trail Gravity mountain bike tires, bias-ply vs. more radial\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_thread-angles-comparison.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_thread-angles-comparison-297x143.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_thread-angles-comparison-120x58.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_thread-angles-comparison-768x369.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>conventional bias-ply (<em>l</em>) vs. more radial (<em>r</em>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bias-Ply tires use a 90° crossing structure of fibers, generally angled 45° from the direction of travel, and alternating back and forth. Fibers are arranged in a bias, or diagonal orientation. This makes it easy to create a lightweight and round profile tire with low rolling resistance, and predictable sidewall &amp; overall support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now Schwalbe has created something in between.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Schwalbe’s almost Radial mountain bike tires</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_installing-new-Albert-tires.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_installing-new-Albert-tires.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Radial Trail Gravity mountain bike tires, Albert tire swap\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_installing-new-Albert-tires.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_installing-new-Albert-tires-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_installing-new-Albert-tires-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_installing-new-Albert-tires-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_installing-new-Albert-tires-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_installing-new-Albert-tires-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_installing-new-Albert-tires-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(All other photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So radial tires are nothing new (<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_tire\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a> tells me they were first patented in 1914</em>), but they never really made their way to bicycles. And Schwalbe’s new Radial mountain bike tires aren’t entirely radial… just more radial. They settled on a smaller angle – somewhere between 10-20° – that lets Schwalbe get radial benefits without the need for extra belt support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schwalbe says much of the performance improvement comes from the ~25% shorter support fibers in the more radial construction vs. the conventional bias-ply tire. And since the fibers travel straighter across the tire casing, the distance that shorter, slightly angled fiber covers in the direction of the tire’s movement is reduced by almost 75%. That effectively means that if the tire hit a perfectly sharp edge that deformed the tire from bead-to-bead, in a conventional tire it could impact 100 fibers but in the new Schwalbe Radial tire it would hit only 25.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-more-local-deformation.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-more-local-deformation.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Radial Trail Gravity mountain bike tires, Albert more local deformation\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-more-local-deformation.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-more-local-deformation-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-more-local-deformation-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-more-local-deformation-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-more-local-deformation-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-more-local-deformation-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-more-local-deformation-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Graphics bySchwalbe)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Less tension in the thread, fewer intersections between threads, shorter threads, less threads engaged at any specific impact.

That lets the treadblocks roll around an object to get more grip, but in a smaller area so you don’t sacrifice stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_improved-damping.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"965\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_improved-damping.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Radial Trail Gravity mountain bike tires, improved rebound damping\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_improved-damping.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_improved-damping-297x191.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_improved-damping-120x77.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_improved-damping-768x494.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It also helps slow tire rebound, damping pressure spikes in the tire for a smoother ride and improved “control, grip, and comfort off-road”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the somewhat surprising benefit of a more local deflection is you get a larger contact patch at the same pressures. Schwalbe says it’s a 30% increase in the contact area, without lowering tire pressure. The huge benefit here is that you can actually increase tire pressure by +7psi/0.5bar in the Radial tire and still have a 10% larger contact patch than the conventional bias-ply tire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s huge actually. So, more support and flat resistance AND more grip. Schwalbe even says you can run a less aggressive tread and get the same grip, with improved rolling resistance. And the Radial tires come in at the exact same weight as the old Super Gravity casing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>And the downsides?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-tire-comparison.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-tire-comparison.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Radial Trail Gravity mountain bike tires, Albert back-to--back tests\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-tire-comparison.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-tire-comparison-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-tire-comparison-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-tire-comparison-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-tire-comparison-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>More tire flex does mean a bit of increased rolling resistance, so you won’t see Schwalbe Radial tires blowing up the XC, gravel, or road scene right away. (But it seems this new Albert Radial has more grip and lower rolling resistance<em> vs. the conventional Magic Mary, so there does seem like some possibilities for mixing up tread patterns to get back that extra drag.</em>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other negative is slightly reduced resistance to snake bites. But Schwalbe says they can use the same sidewall reinforcing construction as their previous generation of mountain bike tires without negatively affecting the radial performance, so there’s plenty of room to dial protection in to suit each type of riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Now back to the new Albert tread, itself</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Radial Trail Gravity mountain bike tires, Albert side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Schwalbe Radial construction will be available in three families – Albert, Magic Mary &amp;

But it’s kinda the absolute opposite to Albert. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a very conditions-specific enduro and DH race tire. It’s big and open with tall spikes that overhang the sidewall to claw for grip, inspired by enduro motocross motorcycle tires. You get taller open spikes on the front-specific Shredda and more of a paddle layout on the rear-specific tire. Like the Albert though, the Shredda tread blocks are said to be optimized for the more locally-flexible Radial tire construction, so they fold over an obstacle for improved grip.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Shredda-soft-conditions-tire_rear-and-front-tread.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Shredda-soft-conditions-tire_rear-and-front-tread.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Radial Trail Gravity mountain bike tires, Shredda tread\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Shredda-soft-conditions-tire_rear-and-front-tread.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Shredda-soft-conditions-tire_rear-and-front-tread-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Shredda-soft-conditions-tire_rear-and-front-tread-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Shredda-soft-conditions-tire_rear-and-front-tread-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Shredda-soft-conditions-tire_rear-and-front-tread-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>all-new Shredda rear (<em>l</em>) &amp; front (<em>r</em>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a tire for wet and muddy riding, or for flying down deep loamy trails.

That means aggressive trail, all-mountain, enduro, freeride &amp; DH, plus ebike variations of any of those types of riding, too. So, that also means there are two casing levels – Trail with medium sidewall protection and Gravity with heavy-duty sidewall protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tire options include the new Albert &amp; classic Magic Mary which can be run on either front or rear, plus the new Shredda which is front- or rear-specific.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-Trail-on-mullet.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-Trail-on-mullet.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Radial Trail Gravity mountain bike tires, Albert Trail on a mullet all-mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-Trail-on-mullet.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-Trail-on-mullet-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-Trail-on-mullet-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-Trail-on-mullet-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-Trail-on-mullet-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-Trail-on-mullet-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-Trail-on-mullet-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the tires come in 29″ and 27.5″ options (Shredda Front is 29er only) and in one width per tire. They are 2.5-2.6” wide because the taller, larger tire volume diameter tire benefits more from the new Radial construction. Addix rubber compounds are Soft or Super Soft for the Alberts, or Super Soft only for the more aggro treads.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-on-eMTB.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-on-eMTB.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Radial Trail Gravity mountain bike tires, Albert Gravity on an eMTB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-on-eMTB.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-on-eMTB-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-on-eMTB-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-on-eMTB-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Albert-on-eMTB-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Schwalbe’s pricing is 74€ per tire for the Radial Trail tires, or 80€ for the Radial Gravity tires, with all available through retailers now. Even though it is as simple as how the fabric is oriented inside the tire when it is made, this feels like a real seismic shift in mountain bike tire construction.
