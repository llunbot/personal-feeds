{"title":"‘40 Years Ago, Drexel Made Computer — and Apple — History’","link":"https://drexel.edu/news/archive/2024/March/drexel-apple-40th-anniversary-macintosh-1984","date":1742232310000,"content":"\n<p>Alissa Falcone, in a good piece looking back at (my alma mater) Drexel University’s groundbreaking deal with Apple 40 years ago to provide deeply discounted Macintoshes to all students, and integrate them throughout the campus and curriculums:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Drexel was prepared to buy IBM computers — and had equipped its\ncomputer centers with IBMs for decades — but the cost came to\nmore than $1,000 per unit. IBM’s young competitor Apple, on the\nother hand, was willing to give discounts, provided the University\nagreed to secret negotiations and discreet showings of its newest,\nunreleased personal computer.</p>\n\n<p>Bruce Eisenstein, PhD, Arthur J. Rowland Professor of Electrical\nand Computer Engineering in the College of Engineering, was the\nhead of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at\nthe time, and had been the founding faculty adviser for the Drexel\nComputer Society started in 1972. He was Drexel’s choice to meet\nwith an Apple representative to see the future Macintosh, which\nhad never-before-seen properties like a mouse, icons on a screen\nand different fonts. This new Apple product was more powerful and\neasier to use than earlier personal computers; novices could\nsupposedly master it in 30 minutes (without the need to memorize\nand type coded commands). And Apple agreed on the $1,000 price tag\nfor a model that sold to the public for $2,495.</p>\n\n<p>“I went back to the selection committee and I said, ‘Listen, you\nhave to forget the IBM. This new computer from Apple is the one\nyou have to get. They are going to make it available to us for a\nthousand dollars — that’s all inclusive.’ And the first question\nwas ‘Is it compatible with the IBM computer?’ Well, no. Was there\nsoftware for it? No. Were there any programs for it, like a word\nprocessor? Not yet. So the committee justifiably kept saying,\nwell, what’s the name of this? What’s it like? I couldn’t tell\nthem. I had to say you just gotta trust me on this. So they took a\nvote and unanimously voted to adopt the unknown computer that\nturned out to be the Macintosh,” Eisenstein recalled in <em>Building\nDrexel: The University and Its City, 1891-2016</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Drexel chose the untested Macintosh even knowing that Apple\nwouldn’t announce it to the public until January 1984 and that the\ncomputers wouldn’t be ready until March, almost halfway through\nthat momentous academic year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I never had the pleasure of meeting Eisenstein, but I’d sure like to thank him for his prescience. By the time I got to Drexel in 1991 the Mac was infused throughout campus.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/17/drexel-macintosh-40-years\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1a2e0db69c3410ea00e99c7ae333ce1fb91f7604b1df8a98237aadbbdc0c3b70","category":"Tech"}
