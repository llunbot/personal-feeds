The original iMac came without a floppy drive. The iPhone 7 came without a headphone jack. Mid-2010s MacBooks and MacBook Pros came with USB-A ports. And <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/02/macbook-air-review/\">the original 2008 MacBook Air</a> came without a built-in optical drive for CDs and DVDs. By the time 2012 and 2013 Macs rolled around, products from the iMac to the MacBook Pro followed suit.</p>\n<p>These exclusions have often made Apple's devices thinner, lighter, sleeker, or some combination of all three. But they've also meant that people who still <em>needed</em> those technologies also needed to deal with dongles, adapters, or clunky external accessories hanging off their devices.
