And based on the latest round of rumors, it might actually happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://linktr.ee/analyst941&amp;xcust=1-1-1805421-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Analyst941 on Twitter</a>, Apple is preparing some major upgrades to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/804389/how-to-stage-manager-organize-apps-windows-macos-13-ventura.html\">Stage Manager</a> in iPadOS 17 that will bring several enhancements to the multitasking interface. Among the new features expected are:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• Support for webcams built into external monitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• Source settings for audio output.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• Simultaneous audio/video streams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• Dock resizing on an external display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• The ability to run an external display while the iPad display is off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes it sound like Apple is going all-in with Stage Manager as a pro-level productivity tool for the iPad Pro. (While the feature does work with the M1 iPad Air, the feature is supported on all models of the 11-inch iPad Pro and four generations of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro.) Stage Manager had <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1341608/stage-manager-ipados-windows.html\">a bumpy start</a> when it rolled out as part of iPadOS 16.1, but updates have slowly improved the multitasking interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this year’s Stage Manager update will be interesting, 2024 will reportedly deliver the big iPadOS update we’ve been waiting for. Revegnus (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/tech_reve/status/1653208454763528192&amp;xcust=1-1-1805421-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">@Tech_Reve</a>) on Twitter reports that “many features from macOS are coming to iPadOS” in 2024, as Apple prepares to launch a 14.1-inch iPad Pro with an M3 Pro processor. It’s likely that many of the higher-end features will be limited to models with the M1 processor (and later) like Stage Manager’s external display support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Analyst941 claims that Apple is finally going to release <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/analyst941/status/1653228005269938176&amp;xcust=1-1-1805421-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">iPad versions</a> of its popular pro apps, Final Cut Pro and Logic, in 2024 and 2025 respectively. What’s more, the leaker claims the version of Final Cut Pro for iPadOS “will be 1:1 to its big brother, along with a slightly modified UI to support touch.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will unveil iPadOS 17 at the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC</a> keynote on June 5. However, it sounds like the big changes will come in 2024 with the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1480996/major-ipad-pro-revamp-next-year.html\">next iPad Pro update</a> and iPadOS 18.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"128baa5069f9b5321c024e42cd588bc0fb3cf024b20c69e26ff3f4945ff25e09","category":"Apple"}
