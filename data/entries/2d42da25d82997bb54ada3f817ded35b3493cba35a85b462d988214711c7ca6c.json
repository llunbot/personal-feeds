Two arms strap to your seatstays and hold the fender only where it’s needed to keep the spray from painting your backside.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ass-savers-win-wing-2-road-bike-fender-2.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1376\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ass-savers-win-wing-2-road-bike-fender-2.jpg\" alt=\"win wing 2 road bike fender shown from angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ass-savers-win-wing-2-road-bike-fender-2.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ass-savers-win-wing-2-road-bike-fender-2-297x204.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ass-savers-win-wing-2-road-bike-fender-2-800x550.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ass-savers-win-wing-2-road-bike-fender-2-120x83.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ass-savers-win-wing-2-road-bike-fender-2-768x528.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ass-savers-win-wing-2-road-bike-fender-2-1536x1057.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It keeps your frame safer now, too, with the addition of frame-saving clear decals in the box. It still has gentle rubber grippers on the straps, but the decals let you add another layer for painted frames.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new wishbone fender frame is all black, replacing the prior version for all Win Wing 2 orders. But the stealth black fender shell is a limited edition for the relaunch, so if you want that, order now. Other colors and designs are available, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ass-savers-win-wing-2-road-bike-fender-1.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1458\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ass-savers-win-wing-2-road-bike-fender-1.jpg\" alt=\"win wing 2 road bike fender shown from top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ass-savers-win-wing-2-road-bike-fender-1.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ass-savers-win-wing-2-road-bike-fender-1-297x217.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ass-savers-win-wing-2-road-bike-fender-1-800x583.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ass-savers-win-wing-2-road-bike-fender-1-120x87.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ass-savers-win-wing-2-road-bike-fender-1-768x560.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ass-savers-win-wing-2-road-bike-fender-1-1536x1120.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The WW2 road fender is designed to adequately cover tires up to 35mm wide and weighs 64 grams.
