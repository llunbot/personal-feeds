If you’re like me, you probably didn’t even consider that DT Swiss might have manufacturing in the US.</p>\n<p>Yet, DT Swiss has had a US base of operations since 1994 in Grand Junction, Colorado. DT Swiss originally set up a base of operations in Colorado to be closer to their suppliers as well as to keep spoke production closer to North American customers. From spoke manufacturing to lacing hubs to rims, much of what goes into each production DT Swiss wheelset happens here.</p>\n<p><em>Fun side note: the brand’s European origins can be traced back to 1634 with a factory that produced wire for chain mail! </em></p>\n<h3><img width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-10.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-10.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-10.jpg?resize=1200,799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-10.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-10.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-10.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></h3>\n<h3>DT Swiss USA</h3>\n<p>Spoke production is a major operation at the Grand Junction facility. Wire spools are sent over from Switzerland to be formed in the US. While not all spoke varietals are made there, certain butted, bladed, and aero models are made on site.</p>\n<p>A single machinist oversees the four spoke-forming machines just one door from the corporate offices. I bet many mechanics didn’t realize those stacks of DT Swiss spokes in their shops were made in Colorado’s Western Slope.</p>\n<p><img width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-23.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-23.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-23.jpg?resize=1200,799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-23.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-23.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-23.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-17.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-17.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-17.jpg?resize=1200,799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-17.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-17.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-17.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Made Right Here</h3>\n<p>DT also has a team that applies decals (the technique is called “water slide”) and builds wheels in-house. Their wheel-building process is incredibly detailed, with data being logged for each wheel that goes out the door. There were truing stands covered in dials and gauges all over the place. It was the most technologically advanced wheel-building facility I’ve ever seen. I was impressed, if not overwhelmed.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-19.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-19.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-19.jpg?resize=1200,799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-19.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-19.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-19.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>You can see the Swiss-ness of it all when viewing their production line for wheelsets. Aside from a machine that aids in threading the spokes into the hubs, each wheel is hand-built and trued by a real human at DT Swiss. With rigorous and multiple-step quality control, each wheelset that leaves the building is the made according to high standards.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-29.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-29.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-29.jpg?resize=1200,799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-29.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-29.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-29.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-56.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-56.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-56.jpg?resize=1200,799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-56.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-56.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-56.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-44.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-44.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-44.jpg?resize=1200,799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-44.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-44.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-44.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>The Office Bike Rack</h3>\n<p>After a tour of the impressive domestic production and HQ offices, it was time to go to the best part of the compound: the employee bike rack.

With three letters at the beginning, GRC delineates one of the highest-quality rims produced by DT Swiss (with “G” indicating “gravel” and “C” indicating “carbon”). The 1100 is the series number which is also near the highest end, this signifies the use of the 180 hubs, versus the 240 hubs which are used at the 1400 level. DICUT refers to the interface of the hubs and spokes, and in this case the use of DT Swiss’ T-head aerolite spokes. Finally, the 30 and 50 refer to the depth of the rim.</p>\n<p>-Hub: 180 DICUT with 36T Ratchet EXP System<br />\n-Spokes: T-Head Aerolite (24 spokes 2-cross)<br />\n-Weight: GRC 30 to1350 g / GRC 50 to 1567 g<br />\n-Rim Width: 24 mm<br />\n-Max System Weight: 130 kg<br />\n-ASTM rating: 2<br />\n-Price: $2999</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-3.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-3.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-3.jpg?resize=1200,799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-3.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-3.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-3.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-7.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-7.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-7.jpg?resize=1200,799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-7.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-7.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-7.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-8.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-8.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-8.jpg?resize=1200,799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-8.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-8.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-8.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Now, let’s get into the cheese fondue of this whole shindig: the new GRC 30 and GRC 50 rims with 30 and 50 corresponding to respective rim depths). The GRC 30 is geared toward adventurous riders seeking a high-end, light, and reliable wheelset rather than those seeking flat-out race performance. The GRC 50, then, is a specifically aero-optimized gravel rim for the most demanding riders in the sport. The rim is designed to create the least drag when combined with a 40 mm gravel tire.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-24-at-3.45.59%E2%80%AFPM.png?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-5.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-5.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-5.jpg?resize=1200,799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-5.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-5.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-5.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Both rims sport the same 24 mm internal width and have returned to a hooked design.

Our first day of riding had us shuttled up to the top of the Colorado National Monument. The sage-topped plateau made a great test spot for the GRC 30 wheelset. After swapping the wheels on our personal bikes for the new GRC carbon wheelsets, they set us loose to try the rims out.</p>\n<p>Of the two wheelsets I rode, the GRC 1100 DICUT 30 felt more approachable. With the aim being agility over all-out speed while keeping weight to a minimum and maintaining a strong and reliable rim, the 1100 series wheelset comes with 180 series hubs. These are the lightest and fanciest to come out of DT Swiss with all the machined weight savings possible and ceramic bearings.</p>\n<p><em>Back in high school, I remember looking at the $100+ Bones ceramic Swiss bearings at the skate shop and never thought I’d ever ride them.

Can I afford that? Hell no, but they asked me to come try the wheels, and I did.</p>\n<p>The GRC 30 1100 wheels are stiff and strong. I leaned on them as hard I could, sent them through rock gardens, pinging the rims multiple times, and they didn’t flinch. Yeah, a sub-1400-gram wheelset felt as fast as it should.

Since it seems like gravel racing is quickly becoming a “time trial but make it off-road” discipline, ever focused on aero gains, I think DT Swiss is onto something here.</p>\n<p>I learned that wheels account for approximately 7% to 8% of the total drag on a bike and rider, so if you’re looking to shave those seconds and make marginal gains, these might be for you. It is hard to see in the photos, but the rims form an elegant hourglass shape when paired with a 40c tire, which the engineers found to be the most aerodynamic wheel and tire combination.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-24-at-3.45.29%E2%80%AFPM.png?fit=1200,656&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-83.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-83.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-83.jpg?resize=1200,799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-83.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-83.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-83.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I was impressed with the quality and finish of the wheelsets I saw and rode over the two days. The rims come straight out of the mold with the appearance you see in these photos. No finish work is needed, which is some true carbon wizardry.</p>\n<p>I find myself, and I think many of our readers, less interested in the highest end of these products. I’m hoping that I can try a set of the GRC 30 rims paired with a 240 or even 350 hub in the future, with the hope of getting that price point to something somewhat more reasonable while still experiencing the new rim technology.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-61.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-61.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-61.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-61.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-61.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-62.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-62.jpg?w=1999&amp;quality=75 1999w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-62.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-62.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-62.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-77.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-77.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-77.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-77.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024_DT_Swiss_GJ-77.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>At the End of the Gravel Road</h3>\n<p>Shout out to all the DT Swiss staff who had us out to Grand Junction! I was impressed with the quality of domestic production happening in Colorado, and blown away by the range of riding right around the city.

And, as the brand’s US and global operations turn 30 years old soon, you can bet they will celebrate with a few more exciting product launches…</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/dt-swiss-grc-1100-diecut-30-and-50-review/\">DT Swiss GRC 1100 DICUT 30 and 50 Wheelsets and US Factory Visit</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"d264bd229524eede015c4063562898e33705f3e6e76e1466b238da39d8cb3f6a","category":"Cycling"}
