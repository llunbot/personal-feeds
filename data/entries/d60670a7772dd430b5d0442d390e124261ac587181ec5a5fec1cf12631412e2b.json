I do a boatload of dispersed camping and have pulled off the makeshift trailside shower before, the experience wasn’t super pleasant. But, the way I rigged it wasn’t as sophisticated as the <a href=\"https://rinsekit.com/products/10-gallon-rinsekit-tailgate-shower\" target=\"_blank\">10 Gallon RinseKit Tailgate Shower</a>, either. It would have been great to have the pressure to easily wash off the 3 to 4 days’ worth of trail dust. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-without-bikes-first-pic-e1741717120211.webp\"><img width=\"900\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-without-bikes-first-pic-e1741717120211.webp\" alt=\"RinseKit Tailgate Shower without bikes first pic\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-without-bikes-first-pic-e1741717120211.webp 900w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-without-bikes-first-pic-e1741717120211-297x206.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-without-bikes-first-pic-e1741717120211-120x83.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-without-bikes-first-pic-e1741717120211-768x533.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / RinseKit)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A portable shower can be a game-changer when out and off the grid and you or your gear need a quick rinse. The RinseKit Tailgate Shower would be a handy piece of gear, and I’m pretty sure it’s the only tailgate-mounted shower system out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-rinsing-wheel.webp\"><img width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-rinsing-wheel.webp\" alt=\"RinseKit Tailgate Shower rinsing wheel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-rinsing-wheel.webp 900w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-rinsing-wheel-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-rinsing-wheel-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-rinsing-wheel-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-rinsing-tire.webp\"><img width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-rinsing-tire.webp\" alt=\"RinseKit Tailgate Shower rinsing tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-rinsing-tire.webp 900w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-rinsing-tire-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-rinsing-tire-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-rinsing-tire-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tailgate Shower isn’t only a shower, it can be used as a quick and versatile water source and as a cleaning station for anything. It uses an electric-powered pump that provides a powerful (50 PSI) and consistent spray, providing up to 16 minutes of non-stop rinsing.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-strap.webp\"><img width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-strap.webp\" alt=\"RinseKit Tailgate Shower strap\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-strap.webp 900w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-strap-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-strap-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-strap-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>RinseKit says that the Tailgate Shower was designed with mountain bikers in mind. It can hold up to five bikes with the five EVA molded bike slots. It also boasts the thickest padding of any tailgate pad. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-bladder.webp\"><img width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-bladder.webp\" alt=\"RinseKit Tailgate Shower bladder\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-bladder.webp 900w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-bladder-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-bladder-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-bladder-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>The 10-gallon bladder and hose/nozzel storage</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of newer trucks have 12v power at the back of the beds, and the tailgate shower comes with a 12v plug. Or, if your truck doesn’t have a 12v outlet, it can be powered by a standard 4-pin trailer plug. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-coiled-hose.webp\"><img width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-coiled-hose.webp\" alt=\"RinseKit Tailgate Shower coiled hose\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-coiled-hose.webp 900w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-coiled-hose-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-coiled-hose-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-coiled-hose-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tailgate Shower is said to fit any tailgate. It holds 10 gallons of water and is portable, which makes it incredibly versatile. You can use it to rinse down a muddy mountain bike, wash dishes, dogs, shoes, and camp chairs, or grab a quick trailside shower. It doesn’t heat the water but is compatible with RinseKit’s propane-powered <a href=\"https://rinsekit.com/products/hyperheater-2?_pos=1&amp;_sid=26783e428&amp;_ss=r\" target=\"_blank\">HyperHeater</a> accessory. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-rinsing-fork.webp\"><img width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-rinsing-fork.webp\" alt=\"RinseKit Tailgate Shower rinsing fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-rinsing-fork.webp 900w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-rinsing-fork-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-rinsing-fork-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RinseKit-Tailgate-Shower-rinsing-fork-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tailgate Shower Retail &amp; Detail</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $399</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Capacity – </strong>10 gallons / 5 bikes</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Weight –</strong> 13 lbs empty</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Power – </strong>4 Pin Trailer Plug or 12V Plug.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>10ft Hose &amp; 5 Spray Nozzle Settings</strong> – Settings include jet, mist, center, flat, and shower</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>12V Water Pump </strong>– 50 PSI of pressure.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>5 EVA Molded Bike Slots</strong> – Equipped with heavy duty straps.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Adjustable Padding and Straps for Universal Fit </strong>– Fits any sized bike</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Felt Liner </strong>– Protects vehicle paint.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>16 Minute Spray Time </strong>– On center setting.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>1 Year Warranty </strong>– Covers workmanship and materials</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dimensions: </strong>52.5″W x 6.5″D x 20″H</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://rinsekit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RinseKit.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rinsekit-10-gallon-tailgate-shower-pad-bike-carrier/\">Carry 5 Bikes and Clean Up After with RinseKit 10 Gallon Tailgate Shower Pad</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"d60670a7772dd430b5d0442d390e124261ac587181ec5a5fec1cf12631412e2b","category":"Cycling"}
