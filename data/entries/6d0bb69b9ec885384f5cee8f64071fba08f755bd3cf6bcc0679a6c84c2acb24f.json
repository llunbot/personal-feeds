With a 30+ hour run time on low, and almost four hours on high, there’s plenty of juice for any use, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-beam-patterns.jpg\"><img width=\"1091\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-beam-patterns.jpg\" alt=\"fenix BC15R bike light beam patterns shown on the ground\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-beam-patterns.jpg 1091w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-beam-patterns-297x110.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-beam-patterns-800x297.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-beam-patterns-120x45.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-beam-patterns-768x285.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What sets it apart is the anti-glare cut-off beam pattern. Like a modern car headlight, it cuts off about waist high so it won’t blind oncoming traffic, cyclists, or pedestrians, but properly illuminate your path. It throws light from 92ft up to 256ft depending on mode, and will remember which mode you were in the last time you used it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-2.jpg\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1058\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-2.jpg\" alt=\"fenix BC15R bike light shown from various angles\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-2.jpg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-2-297x126.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-2-800x339.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-2-120x51.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-2-768x325.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-2-1536x650.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-2-2048x867.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The light uses a detachable strap mount, so you can easily pull it off the bike for recharging. It’s only 109g and just 4″ long by about 1.23″ square.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-output-levels.jpg\"><img width=\"1028\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-output-levels.jpg\" alt=\"fenix BC15R bike light output and specs chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-output-levels.jpg 1028w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-output-levels-297x130.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-output-levels-800x350.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-output-levels-120x53.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fenix-bc15r-bicycle-headlight-output-levels-768x336.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Three solid modes output 50, 150, and 400 lumens, plus a flashing mode that pulses between 50 and 400 lumens. It recharges fully in about 2 hours via USB-C cable. Fenix says the highest output mode trickles down over time to prevent it from overheating, and that all modes will automatically drop to Low as the battery gets lower to protect it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSRP is $47, but it’s on sale as of this post going live. Optional helmet and GoPro-style mounts are available separately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.fenixlighting.com/products/fenix-bc15r-rechargeable-bike-light\">Feni</a><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=19961&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fenixlighting.com%2Fproducts%2Ffenix-bc15r-rechargeable-bike-light\">xLighting.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fenix-adds-traffic-friendly-bc15r-bike-headlight/\">Fenix adds Traffic-Friendly BC15R Bike Headlight</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"6d0bb69b9ec885384f5cee8f64071fba08f755bd3cf6bcc0679a6c84c2acb24f","category":"Cycling"}
