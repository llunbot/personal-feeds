The Livigno is a lightweight, breathable full-face aimed at enduro or downhill riders. It offers full protection with CE, CPSC, and ASTM certifications for DH riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Livigno joins Limar’s E_VOLUTION collection of MTB helmets. The collection (currently) also includes the Tonale and Etna open-faced helmets which launched last year. Limar aims to keep all their helmets comfortably lightweight, and the Livigno is no exception. A size medium weighs a claimed 590g, and a large is listed at 640g.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Limar Livigno – Shell and Ventilation:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-green-side.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1079\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-green-side.jpg\" alt=\"Limar Livigno full-face helmet, green, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-green-side.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-green-side-297x267.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-green-side-800x719.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-green-side-120x108.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-green-side-768x691.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Livigno’s shell is made using Limar’s In-Mould double construction, combining a polycarbonate shell with an expanded polystyrene liner. The chin guard is made from a lightweight combination of ABS and polystyrene. Limar also uses ABS for the adjustable visor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-vents-channels.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-vents-channels.jpg\" alt=\"Limar Livigno full-face helmet, vents, air channels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-vents-channels.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-vents-channels-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-vents-channels-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-vents-channels-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-vents-channels-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the many vents in the shell and chin bar, the Livigno full-face features internal channels behind the front vents to help air flow freely around your head.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Safety Features:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-interior.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-interior.jpg\" alt=\"Limar Livigno full-face helmet, interior\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-interior.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-interior-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-interior-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-interior-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-interior-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With safety in mind the Livigno features theMips Air Node safety system<strong>, </strong>which hides a low friction layer inside the helmet’s padding. The padding attaches to the shell via nylon hook-and-loop ‘nodes’, and it can be shaped around vents so it won’t restrict airflow. It’s also a very lightweight way to incorporate the benefits of Mips – reducing rotational forces on your brain in a crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-rear.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1227\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-rear.jpg\" alt=\"Limar Livigno full-face helmet, rear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-rear.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-rear-293x300.jpg 293w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-rear-800x818.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-rear-117x120.jpg 117w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-rear-768x785.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Limar gives the Livigno their Air Fit Evo dial adjuster, which offers multi-level, multi-directional adjustment around the head. The system offers three height positions for the rear occipital cradle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-green-angle.jpg\"><img width=\"1251\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-green-angle.jpg\" alt=\"Limar Livigno full-face helmet, green, angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-green-angle.jpg 1251w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-green-angle-297x285.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-green-angle-800x767.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-green-angle-120x115.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-green-angle-768x737.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two different thicknesses of cheek pads available. Both the 20mm and 25mm thick pads are included with each helmet. The Livigno’s cheek pads are removable, and not just for washing: Limar notes the pads will pull out easily in case of an accident where medical help is required.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-on-rider.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-on-rider.jpg\" alt=\"Limar Livigno full-face helmet, on rider\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-on-rider.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-on-rider-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-on-rider-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-on-rider-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-on-rider-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Limar-Livigno-full-face-on-rider-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>*Photos and videos c.
