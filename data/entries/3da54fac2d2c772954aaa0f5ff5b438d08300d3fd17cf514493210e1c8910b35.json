We did not have to go far, maybe 50 meters, because the prototype engine designed and built by his small engineering team is not that large.</span></p>\n<p>We waited for a few minutes before steam began to hiss out of the engine. And then, for a few seconds, the engine emitted a distinctive whistling sound. \"There it is!\" Duggleby exclaimed. By <em>it</em>, he meant the sound of a rotating detonation engine firing after its ignition. The sound indicated that a reaction was successfully rotating at 20,000 times a second around the engine.</p>\n<figure>\n    <div>\n        Venus Aerospace Detonation, from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/812144124/c25e7e3c7c\">Vimeo</a>    </div>\n        <figcaption>\n        <div>Venus Aerospace Detonation, from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/812144124/c25e7e3c7c\">Vimeo</a> </div>\n    </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n<p>Duggleby is chief technology officer of a company he co-founded with his wife, Sassie. Venus Aerospace has the goal of building a hypersonic aircraft that can carry perhaps a dozen passengers and travel at the astonishingly fast speed of Mach 9, or more than 11,000 kilometers an hour.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928356#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928356&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3da54fac2d2c772954aaa0f5ff5b438d08300d3fd17cf514493210e1c8910b35","category":"Tech"}
