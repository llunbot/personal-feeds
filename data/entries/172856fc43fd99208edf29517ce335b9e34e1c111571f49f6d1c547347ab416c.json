One of these is called Cinematic Mode. This article explains what Cinematic Mode is and how to use it.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iphone-12-pro-cinematic-mode.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>What is Cinematic Mode?</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nCinematic Mode utilizes Dolby Vision HDR and a technique called \"rack focus\" to seamlessly shift the focus from one subject to another when you're shooting video. It does this by locking the focus on the subject in a scene and blurring the background to achieve depth of field. If you subsequently move the camera to center on a new subject or a new subject enters the scene, Cinematic mode automatically switches the focal point to this new subject and blurs out the background. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor example, if you're shooting video of someone and then a second person enters the scene, your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> will intelligently adjust the surrounding blur to focus-lock on the second person. It will even automatically switch back to the initial subject if the person's face looks away from the camera, effectively generating a sophisticated professional filmmaking effect on the fly. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile impressive, Cinematic Mode isn't perfect, however Apple has also made the effect fully adjustable, thanks to a post-shoot editing mode that lets you alter focal points after you've captured video.
