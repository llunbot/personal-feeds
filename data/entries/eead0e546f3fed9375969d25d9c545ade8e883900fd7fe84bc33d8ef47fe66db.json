Today, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3YLRM8\">Amazon is selling the newest A17 Pro iPad mini for $399</a>, a savings of $100 and matching the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest upgrade in the latest iPad Mini is the A17 Pro chip, which means it supports <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a>. The 8.3-inch Liquid Retina Display isn’t new, but it’s gorgeous as well, with great color and deep contrast. We also love to see that the base model now comes with 128GB, which is double what the previous version had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also on sale is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Pencil-Pro-Pixel-Perfect-Industry-Leading/dp/B0D3J71RM7\">Apple Pencil Pro for $99</a>, good for $30 off its MSRP, which is compatible with the new iPad mini and brings several writing and drawing features, including squeeze and haptic controls, and pixel-perfect precision, tilt, and pressure sensitivity. And with magnetic charging, you can attach it to the side edge of the Pad mini for safekeeping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2504744/ipad-mini-a17-pro-review.html\">4-star review</a>, we praised the speed and size of the iPad mini and its support for Apple Intelligence. We concluded that it’s a great upgrade for older tablets and maintains its position as the absolute best small tablet you can buy. So take advantage of this super early Black Friday deal and snatch the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3W4YHS/?th=1\">iPad Mini for $399 at Amazon</a> while you still can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"eead0e546f3fed9375969d25d9c545ade8e883900fd7fe84bc33d8ef47fe66db","category":"Apple"}
