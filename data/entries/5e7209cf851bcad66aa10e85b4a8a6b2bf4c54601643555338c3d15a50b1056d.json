Marco chose the <a href=\"https://allcitycycles.com/bikes/gorilla_monsoon_grx\" target=\"_blank\">All-City Gorilla Monsoon</a> as the chassis for his newest build project and over the past 18 months, he’s been perfecting the build. Let’s see it in detail below…<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_5080-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I bought the All-City Gorilla Monsoon as a frame only during the first lockdown in UK. Apparently it was the last green shaded frame size 52 available in UK, and the guys at SBC Cycles managed the get their hands on. The initial idea was just to swap the parts from my Brothers Kepler with the aim to increase tyre clearance from 650 plus up to 2.4 and to do long weekend trips.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_4833.jpg\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_4832.jpg\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_7412-scaled.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>It didn’t take a long time to realise how capable and fun the bike is and (pushed also from the never-ending lockdown restrictions) I ended up to use it only for short journeys mainly on trails so I decided to go flat bars… and the cool thing is the possibility to easily swap between the two configurations since rear derailleur and brakes are connected to shifters on the drops and all the cables are external.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_4836.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>From a simple frame swap I then started to test different configurations and lately I am running carbon hops on Onyx hubs… so smooth I love the silent costing in the woods!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_4901-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Drop configuration:<br />\nHope finishing kit, RX4 brake calipers and hubs laced to kinlin rims<br />\nShimano Ultegra shifters an RX800 derailleur, SLX 11-42 cassette<br />\nEaston carbon crankset (cracked so running Hope Cranks)<br />\nRitchey Venturemax drops<br />\nMaxxis Ikon 27.5×2.4</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/DSCN0530_Original-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Flatbar configuration:<br />\nOnyx hubs laced with Sapim CX Ray spokes to carbon Light Bicycle Recon Pro rims<br />\nShimano SLX 11 speed shifters and rear derailleur, Shimano Deore brakeset<br />\nNice and 780 wide Omnium Wunderbar<br />\nTeravail Honcho 27.5×2.4</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG-20210815-WA0001.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Rode for a while with Jones Loop bars as well…</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_6320-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_4971-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_5797-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_6001-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_6018-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_6949-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>____</p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who have <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared over here.
