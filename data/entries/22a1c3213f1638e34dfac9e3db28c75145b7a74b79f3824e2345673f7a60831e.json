They are joined by 1984 Tour de France polka dot jersey winner Pippa York, formerly known as Robert Millar, who is now working in the worlds of journalism and human rights. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode York discusses personal highlights from her racing career, the 1985 ‘Stolen Vuelta’, and compares the current cycling scene to her racing days. York, who transitioned privately after her retirement in 1995 and came back into public life in 2017, also talks us through the story of her transition, her exponentially growing happiness, and about trans people in sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>York is profoundly honest in her expertise and reflection in a brilliant and thought-provoking episode. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To hear more from Pippa York, she’ll be speaking at the Cycle Show at Alexandra Palace, London later this month and <a href=\"https://www.cycleshow.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">tickets are still available to book</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes/76-polka-dot-jersey-winner-pippa-york-on-finding-happiness\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 76 now on Acast</a></strong></li><li><strong>Check out </strong><a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>all episodes</strong></a></li><li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>***</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We’ve partnered with Quotezone on a prize draw to win a one year subscription to Cyclist magazine worth over £75, all you need to do is try out Quotezone’s bicycle insurance comparison tool and you’ll be automatically entered into the prize draw when you get a quote. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Simply go to <a href=\"http://quotezone.co.uk/cyclist\" target=\"_blank\">quotozone.co.uk/cyclist</a> and try out the comparison tool to be entered into the prize draw.
