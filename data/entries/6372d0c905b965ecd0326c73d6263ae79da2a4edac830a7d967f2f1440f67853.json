{"title":"MacRumors Giveaway: Win a Bamboo Standing Desk From Flexispot","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/30/macrumors-giveaway-flexispot-bamboo-desk/","date":1633024800000,"content":"We've teamed up with <a href=\"https://www.flexispot.com/\">Flexispot</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a <a href=\"https://www.flexispot.com/kana-pro-bamboo-standing-desk-ec8\">Kana Pro Bamboo Standing Desk</a>, which is the perfect work from home accessory and a great complement to any Apple product workflow. Flexispot makes a <a href=\"https://www.flexispot.com/desks/height-adjustable-desks\">whole range</a> of standing desks, ergonomic chairs, and desk bikes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/kana-pro-desk-1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAvailable with a rectangular or curved design, the Kana Pro Bamboo Standing Desk has a simple, clean look that works with many office designs. It measures in at 48 inches long by 24 inches wide, with an adjustable frame that comes in white, black, or gray.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nAs the name suggests, the desktop is made from bamboo, which Flexispot says has twice the durability of ordinary wood, plus it's been protected with a lacquer coating to provide protection from scratches, dings, and water damage. The height of the desk can be adjusted from 23.6 inches to 49.2 inches high using the dual-motor lifting system, and it can hold up to 275 pounds, which is enough for a desktop computer setup with multiple displays.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/kana-pro-desk-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe desk's controls are located on the right side, and there are simple touch controls that can be used to adjust the height. There are up/down movements and four memory slots for saving favorite positions. At the right side, there's a USB-A port that can be used for charging, and an LED screen lets you know the height of the desk.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/kana-pro-desk-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAn anti-collision feature aims to detect and prevent collisions with the desk before they happen, and a child lock option locks the height in a certain position until it's deactivated so children cannot play with the controls.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/kana-pro-desk-4.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the bottom, there's a built-in cable tray with a groove that's meant to hide cables below the desk to keep them organized and out of sight, and there's an optional Socket Outlet that adds three sockets, a USB-A port, and a USB-C port right to the top of the desktop.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/kana-pro-desk-5.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWe have one Kana Pro Bamboo Standing Desk to give away to <em>MacRumors</em> readers.
