But the system's modular nature makes it possible to expand it beyond Windows PC hardware, as we've seen with experiments like the (now-discontinued) <a href=\"https://frame.work/products/laptop-chromebook-12-gen-intel\">Chromebook Edition of the laptop</a>.</p>\n<p>Today Framework is expanding to something even more experimental: a <a href=\"https://frame.work/products/deep-computing-risc-v-mainboard\">DeepComputing RISC-V Mainboard</a> targeted primarily at developers. RISC-V is a fully open source and royalty-free instruction set, making it possible for anyone to adopt and use it without having to license it (unlike x86, which is a maze of cross-licensed Intel and AMD technologies that other companies can't really buy into; or Arm, which is licensed by the company of the same name).</p>\n<p>First announced <a href=\"https://frame.work/blog/introducing-a-new-risc-v-mainboard-from-deepcomputing\">in June 2024</a>, the board is available to order today for $199. The board is designed to fit in a Framework Laptop 13 chassis, which means that people who would prefer a desktop can also put it into <a href=\"https://frame.work/products/cooler-master-mainboard-case\">the $39 Cooler Master Mainboard Case</a> that Framework offers.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/framework-laptop-expands-beyond-x86-with-its-first-ever-risc-v-based-motherboard/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/framework-laptop-expands-beyond-x86-with-its-first-ever-risc-v-based-motherboard/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d775d05d0fdb87a16f2e30628f7f9b4c789ad8cc884cc8e26dbc69581c7d8c42","category":"Tech"}
