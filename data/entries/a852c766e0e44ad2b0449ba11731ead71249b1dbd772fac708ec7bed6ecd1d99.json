But while Claude 3.7 is <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/claudeplayspokemon\">still struggling to make consistent progress at the game</a> weeks later, a similar <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/gemini_plays_pokemon\">Twitch-streamed effort using Google's Gemini 2.5 model</a> managed to finally complete <em>Pokémon Blue</em> this weekend across over 106,000 in-game actions, earning accolades from followers, <a href=\"https://x.com/sundarpichai/status/1918455766542930004?t=8NLgn42y3kAqUbZVhg4zLw&amp;s=19\">including Google CEO Sundar Pichai</a>.</p>\n<p>Before you start using this achievement as a way to compare the relative performance of these two AI models—or even the advancement of LLM capabilities over time—there are some important caveats to keep in mind. As it happens, Gemini needed some fairly significant outside help on its path to eventual Pokémon victory.</p>\n<h2>Strap in to the agent harness</h2>\n<p>Gemini Plays Pokémon developer JoelZ (who's unaffiliated with Google) will be the first to tell you that Pokémon is ill-suited as a reliable benchmark for LLM models. As he <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/gemini_plays_pokemon\">writes on the project's Twitch FAQ</a>, \"please don't consider this a benchmark for how well an LLM can play Pokémon. You can't really make direct comparisons—Gemini and Claude have different tools and receive different information. ... Claude's framework has many shortcomings so I wanted to see how far Gemini could get if it were given the right tools.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/why-google-geminis-pokemon-success-isnt-all-its-cracked-up-to-be/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/why-google-geminis-pokemon-success-isnt-all-its-cracked-up-to-be/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a852c766e0e44ad2b0449ba11731ead71249b1dbd772fac708ec7bed6ecd1d99","category":"Tech"}
