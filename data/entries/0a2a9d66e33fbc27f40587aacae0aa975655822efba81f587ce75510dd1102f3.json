What's more, the specifics of the exploit suggest similar homebrew capabilities may soon be available on some versions of the PlayStation 5.</p>\n<p>The new exploit builds on a known error in the way that the PS4's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/webkit/\" target=\"_blank\">WebKit</a> implementation utilizes <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face\" target=\"_blank\">font-faces</a>. That exploit on the PS4 was <a href=\"https://wololo.net/2021/10/14/use-after-free-webkit-vulnerability-impacts-ps4-possibly-up-to-firmware-9-00-included/\" target=\"_blank\">publicized in October</a> as a proof of concept after a similar error was found in <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212808\" target=\"_blank\">Apple's Safari WebKit implementation in September</a>.</p>\n<p>On the PS4, the full exploit can now be triggered by visiting a website with specially formatted JavaScript <a href=\"https://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps4/browser/browse.html\" target=\"_blank\">via the PS4 web browser</a>, allowing the system to run kernel-level code that bypasses the console's usual security protections. From there, the exploit can read files from an inserted USB stick and install homebrew software, including <a href=\"https://github.com/GoldHEN/GoldHEN\">existing custom PS4 firmware</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1820575#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1820575&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0a2a9d66e33fbc27f40587aacae0aa975655822efba81f587ce75510dd1102f3","category":"Tech"}
