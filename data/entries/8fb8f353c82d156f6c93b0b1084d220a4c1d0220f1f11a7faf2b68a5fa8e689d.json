Beeper made headlines back in December for Beeper Mini, an app that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/beeper-mini-brings-imessage-to-android/\">brought iMessage to Android devices</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/beeper-automattic-acquisition.png\" width=\"1304\" height=\"736\" />\r<br />\nBeeper Mini used reverse engineered iMessage protocols and encryption, taking advantage of Apple's own iMessage servers to let Android users send \"blue bubble\" texts to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users without an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a>. The app supported all iMessage functionality, including read receipts, typing indictors, reactions, and end-to-end encryption.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple was not happy with Beeper Mini using its iMessage servers, and it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/08/beeper-mini-imessage-for-android-shutdown/\">blocked the Beeper Mini app</a>. Beeper <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/beeper-mini-android-imessage-app-back/\">tried workarounds</a>, but after suggesting Android users acquire a jailbroken ‌iPhone‌ to get the service to work, the company <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/beeper-mini-jailbreak-iphone-last-effort/\">gave up on the idea</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAfter Apple blocked Beeper Mini from working, both the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/22/doj-and-ftc-looking-into-beeper-controversy/\">met with Beeper CEO Eric Migicovsky</a>. Beeper Mini was ultimately mentioned in the DoJ's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-vs-doj/\">antitrust filing against Apple</a>, with the DoJ suggesting it was a \"fix\" for the broken Android to ‌iPhone‌ cross-platform messaging issue.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAutomattic does not plan to revive Beeper Mini, but is instead taking on Beeper, a universal chat app available for Android, iOS, and desktop devices. Beeper is able to integrate with multiple chat networks with a universal inbox, though it does not currently work with iMessage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a post <a href=\"https://blog.beeper.com\">announcing the acquisition</a> by Automattic, Beeper CEO Eric Migicovsky said that Beeper is \"cautiously optimistic about the future\" because the DoJ has \"sued Apple for blocking Beeper Mini's access to iMessage.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoing forward, Migicovsky will serve as Automattic's Head of Messaging, and Beeper will operate as an independent team.
