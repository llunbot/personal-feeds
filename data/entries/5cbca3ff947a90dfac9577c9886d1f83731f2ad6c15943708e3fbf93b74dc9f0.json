Overall I’d say my kit choice has been pretty good, save for a few things that could either be improved or I didn’t need.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The MVPs</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-13-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cyclist on bike selfie\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-13-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-13-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-13-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-13-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-13-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-13-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-13.jpg 1024w\" /><figcaption>Emma Cole</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, the Maap Alt_Road short sleeve jerseys (<a href=\"https://maap.cc/uk/products/womens-alt_road-jersey-mars\" target=\"_blank\">£170</a>) are genuinely brilliant. They have kept their shape despite my dodgy washing technique (read on) and are extremely comfortable to wear day in and day out. The orange colour has been particularly welcome when riding on busy Italian roads as I know I stand out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Maap base layers have also been outstanding. I know there is a debate on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/should-you-still-wear-a-base-layer-in-the-summer\" target=\"_blank\">whether to wear a base layer in summer</a> but after this trip I am firmly in the wear one camp.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-14-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cyclist pensive on bench\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-14-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-14-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-14-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-14-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-14-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-14-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-14.jpg 1024w\" /><figcaption>Emma Cole</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Maap Alt_Road socks (<a href=\"https://maap.cc/uk/products/alt_road-trail-sock-black-cypress-green\" target=\"_blank\">£</a><a href=\"https://maap.cc/uk/products/alt_road-trail-sock-black-cypress-green\" target=\"_blank\">28</a>) also deserve a mention. Although only a small – and some people might think less important – kit area, these socks have kept my feet in great condition over the 18 days of riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I took a pair of shorts and T-shirt for casual-wear along with a pair of thin trackies and spare socks, and would definitely recommend doing this for the evenings when you don’t want to be head-to-toe in Lycra.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What could I have left behind?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-3-728x970.jpg\" alt=\"cyclist gotthard selfie\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-3-728x970.jpg 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-3-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-3-750x1000.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-3.jpg 768w\" /><figcaption>Emma Cole</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://fave.co/3qCCFu4\" target=\"_blank\">Maap Alt_Road thermal vest (£96)</a>, long sleeve jersey (<a href=\"https://maap.cc/uk/products/womens-alt_road-ls-jersey-dark-desert\" target=\"_blank\">£190</a>) and long sleeve tech tee (<a href=\"https://maap.cc/uk/products/womens-alt_road-ride-ls-tee-3-0-cypress-green\" target=\"_blank\">£75</a>) have not been worn at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been because the weather has been scorching sunshine all the time so I have chosen to wear the short sleeve jerseys instead with a lot of sun block slapped on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you can never be sure what the weather is going to do but in hindsight I didn’t need to bring the gilet and could have picked just one of the long sleeve tops. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"777\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-4.jpg\" alt=\"cyclist lying on floor\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-4.jpg 777w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-4-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Emma Cole</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While I only wore the Maap Alt_Road gloves (<a href=\"https://maap.cc/uk/products/alt_road-glove-cypress-green\" target=\"_blank\">£75</a>) once when descending the Gotthard Pass, I was extremely grateful to have them, so I would say they were worth lugging around as they are also very small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite only wearing the Maap Transit packable puffer (<a href=\"https://maap.cc/uk/products/womens-transit-packable-puffer-black\" target=\"_blank\">£305</a>) a handful of times, I would also take this again. It’s light, extremely warm and a handy pillow or something to sit on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A final consideration is the Maap thermal jacket (<a href=\"https://maap.cc/uk/products/womens-alt_road-thermal-jacket-burnt-olive\" target=\"_blank\">£230</a>), which, again given the weather, I have only worn a few times, in the early mornings in France and descending a few big climbs, but it would definitely be packed again.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bikepacking-fuel\">Tunisia Diaries: How to fuel on a bikepacking trip</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/motivation-on-long-rides\">Tunisia Diaries: How I’m staying motivated on a 2,000km ride</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ribble-gravel-ti\">Tunisia Diaries: This is the bike I’m riding to Tunisia </a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>How have the bib shorts faired?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"768\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-1.jpg\" alt=\"cyclist bibs pockets\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-1.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Emma Cole</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A critical piece of kit, in general the <a href=\"https://www.sigmasports.com/item/MAAP/Alt-Road-Cargo-Womens-Bib-Short/YNRJ?s=1\" target=\"_blank\">Maap Alt_Road bibs (£152) </a>have been good. They are comfortable, have held their shape, and protected me from the elements. The pockets are brilliant, especially the zip pocket on the left thigh and the bigger pocket on the right thigh, which have been great for taking my valuables when I lock my bike up outside a shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One sticking point has been the lack of a comfort break feature. Peeling off a sweaty jersey and then painstakingly trying to put it back on as it sticks to you is not ideal. Add in the day I wore a short sleeve tech tee when I had to take off my helmet too, then it was actually very inconvenient. That said, I’ve not been racing, so I’ve had enough time to do all of this.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"907\" height=\"605\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-16.jpg\" alt=\"cyclist selfie\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-16.jpg 907w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-16-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-16-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-16-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-16-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-16-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Emma Cole</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another point of note is that the pair of light green shorts shows sweat. I only realised this recently, having been thinking people have been staring just because I’m wearing Lycra. Oh no, it was because I looked like I had wet myself. Looking back, luckily, I find the whole thing hilarious, but it is worth noting that if you are cycling in 30-degree heat for ten hours a day, you might want to think carefully about your colour choice (or just don’t care as I did).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, I do think the bibs are great but they <em>need</em> a comfort break feature. Thankfully, having spoken to Maap I know this is something the brand is conscious of and working on.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Check out our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-womens-bibshorts-buyers-guide\" target=\"_blank\">best women’s cycling bib shorts</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How have I kept my clothes clean?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-6-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"back of cyclist with mountain backdrop\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-6-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-6-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-6-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-6-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-6-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-stuff-6.jpg 1024w\" /><figcaption>Emma Cole</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Staying clean has been hard, particularly in the first few days when I wasn’t in a good routine. The way I have gingerly ‘cleaned’ my clothes has been by rinsing them with water in the morning and strapping them to the back of my bike to dry throughout the day. I do love bungee cords. The idea for this came when I met a pair of e-bike tourers, and the lady was doing just that. Previously I had been struggling with saddle sores, my first time ever, and now I know it was because I was wearing damp bibs. I shudder at the thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have also been two occasions when I was staying in a BnB and the host offered to wash my kit, which was a godsend. I think I must have really smelt bad.  </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bikepacking-clothes\">Tunisia Diaries: How many clothes is too many for a bikepacking trip?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Emma Cole &#124; Features Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"5cbca3ff947a90dfac9577c9886d1f83731f2ad6c15943708e3fbf93b74dc9f0","category":"Cycling"}
