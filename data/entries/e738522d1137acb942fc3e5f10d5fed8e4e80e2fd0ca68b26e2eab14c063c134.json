Between cycling and all of my other hobbies, I have more options than I know what to do with. So when Quoc and Restrap reached out about a collaboration they were working on I said yes. With very little info, I thought it could be another cleat mountable sandal that is fun to have but would likely not get used too often with my style of riding.</figure>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/QUOC-Restrap-7901-1340x893.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"893\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/QUOC-Restrap-7901.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/QUOC-Restrap-7901.jpg?width=190 190w\" /></figure>\n<p>Well, it turns out I was wrong because these don’t fit a cleat. However, they might even be more useful than I had imagined. Since I do surf pretty often, you will find me wearing sandals pretty often, but they are almost always flip-flops. This means they don’t function well if I am wearing socks, like before and after a ride.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/QUOC-Restrap-7894-1340x893.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"893\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/QUOC-Restrap-7894.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/QUOC-Restrap-7894.jpg?width=190 190w\" /></figure>\n<p>I am all about comfort and convenience, but I also put a very high emphasis on quality. These Quoc x Restrap Sandals are much nicer than I had imagined. Too often, sandals are produced to hit a specific price point, normally very low. These seem to be produced without as much emphasis on hitting some crazy low price. They are even made in the UK. If I’m being honest, it is nearly the last place I would expect sandals to come from.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/QUOC-Restrap-7900-1340x893.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"893\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/QUOC-Restrap-7900.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/QUOC-Restrap-7900.jpg?width=190 190w\" /></figure>\n<p>The fit is good, and the EVA sole has good flex but enough support that I feel like I could spend a full day in them. While I live in the normally scorching heat of Sothern California, these arrived on a week that has been colder than normal and not sandal weather for me.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/QUOC-Restrap-7899-1340x893.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"893\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/QUOC-Restrap-7899.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/QUOC-Restrap-7899.jpg?width=190 190w\" /></figure>\n<p>The microfiber leather is well-placed and has a good balance of coverage. The straps are very high quality, with a strong hook and loop adjustability. The center strap also features a quick-release feature that allows you to attach the sandals to a bag without adjusting the tension and fit. This makes them a great option if paired with a Restrap bikepacking saddle bag. You wouldn’t need to pack them away. You could just let them hang off the back and leave room in the bag for dry clothes and supplies.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/QUOC-Restrap-7896-1340x893.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"893\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/QUOC-Restrap-7896.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/QUOC-Restrap-7896.jpg?width=190 190w\" /></figure>\n<p>While these are not exactly cycling sandals like I expected, they are coming from brands that know about quality cycling shoes and gear. At $130, they are also not cheap, but they wouldn’t be my most expensive sandals either. For me, these are great options to take to events and races. They are light and comfortable, but most importantly, they work with or without socks. I don’t do much bike packing, but if I can get Neil Shirley to come back to SoCal and do the 150-mile hammerfest from northern LA to San Diego Pizza Port ride, I assure you these will be strapped to my bag and ready for the train ride home.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/05/the-quoc-x-restrap-sandal-first-look-are-they-cycling-sandals/pizzaportride/\"><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Pizzaportride.jpeg\" alt loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Pizzaportride.jpeg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Pizzaportride.jpeg?width=190 190w\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/05/the-quoc-x-restrap-sandal-first-look-are-they-cycling-sandals/img_4477/\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4477-scaled.jpg\" alt loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4477-scaled.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4477-scaled.jpg?width=190 190w\" /></a>\n\n<p><strong><em>FROM QUOC &amp; RESTRAP</em></strong></p>\n<p>Heritage bikepacking gear maker, Restrap, and leading footwear brand, QUOC, have collaborated to develop an all-new sandal, designed to cater for the needs of cyclists and outdoor enthusiasts alike.
