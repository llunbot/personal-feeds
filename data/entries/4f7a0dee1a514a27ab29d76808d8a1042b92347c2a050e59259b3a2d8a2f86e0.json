That brings the number of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/lawsuit-takes-western-digital-to-task-over-sandisk-ssds-allegedly-erasing-data/\">class-action complaints filed against Western Digital</a> to three in two days.</p>\n<p>In May, Ars Technica reported about customer <a href=\"https://forums.sandisk.com/c/portable-ssd/extreme-portable-ssd/235\">complaints</a> that claimed <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/sandisk-extreme-ssds-keep-abruptly-failing-firmware-fix-for-only-some-promised/\">SanDisk Extreme SSDs were abruptly wiping data</a> and becoming unmountable. Ars senior editor Lee Hutchinson also experienced this problem with two Extreme SSDs.
