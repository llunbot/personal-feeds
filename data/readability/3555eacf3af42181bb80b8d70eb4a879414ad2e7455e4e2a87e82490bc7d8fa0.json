{"title":"Zwift’s Neokyo city is open for visitors","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/11/zwifts-neokyo-city-is-open-for-visitors/","date":1637272014000,"content":"<div><div><p>Last month Zwift announced a forthcoming new urban map for its Makuri Islands world. Fast forward a few weeks and the new Neokyo area is now open for business and ready to ride. It’s a timely update for many in the northern hemisphere who are turning to indoor training and perhaps needing a change of scenery.</p><p>Neokyo is the first expansion for Zwift’s Makuri Islands and doubles the world’s size with eight new routes across 13 miles (21 km) of new roads. Contrasting the peaceful tranquillity of the Yumezi map launched back in May, the Neokyo area takes riders on a tour of bustling nighttime city living. Inspired by Japan’s major cities, Neokyo features fast flat roads, busy streets, tall buildings, and neon lights.  </p><p>With the new map comes eight new route badges to collect. The shortest of these new routes is the “Rooftop Rendezvous” with 2.3 miles (3.7 km) of rooftop and monorail riding. The 3.8-mile (6.1 km) “Railways and Rooftops” is a route quite like what the name suggests while the 8.9-mile (14.3 km) “Neon Flats” and 7.6-mile (12.2 km) “Sprinters Playground” are flatter routes with three and four sprints per route. At 20.2 miles (32.5 km) the “Temples and Towers” route is the longest of the new routes and features three KOMs for a total of 2,261 ft (689.2 metres) of elevation gain in a climbing-intense route.</p><p>Rounding out the route options are the “Neokyo All-Nighter”, with three sprints and a KOM jammed into 15.1 miles (24.3 km), the “Sleepless City”, a flatter ride through the heart of the city, and “Wandering Flats”, which takes riders from the scenic countryside to the city centre.</p><p>Neokyo is only available for free rides at the moment, but Zwift hopes to open meet-ups and events on the new map soon. </p><p>Zwift advises that the Neokyo map is a large update, and Zwifters should allow ample time to update ahead of their next Zwift ride. Once updated, Neokyo will be available in the Makuri Islands world on the regular guest worlds rotation. Check out the calendar on the Zwift home screen for a view of when any of the worlds are live. </p><p>For more information head to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zwift.com/neokyo\">www.zwift.com/neokyo</a></p></div></div>","author":"Ronan Mc Laughlin","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"3555eacf3af42181bb80b8d70eb4a879414ad2e7455e4e2a87e82490bc7d8fa0","category":"Cycling"}
