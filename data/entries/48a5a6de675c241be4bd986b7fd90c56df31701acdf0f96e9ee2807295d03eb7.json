This year, their annual club event ran from November 3–5 and promised \"mayhem\" and \"One big night full of surprises.\"</p>\n<p>Soon after an ApeFest party Saturday night, some attendees reported <a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xTangle/status/1721123004451557548\">severe pain and burning sensations in their eyes</a>, as well as vision problems and skin irritation, according to Yuga Labs. Doctors and others on the Internet quickly speculated that the cause was UV exposure and photokeratitis (aka snow blindness, arc eye, or welder's flash), which is akin to a sunburn on the cornea (the clear tissue covering the front of your eye) due to exposure to UV light. The New York Times reported as of Tuesday that the number of attendees injured was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/07/style/bored-ape-nft-eye-burn.html\">over 20</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982771#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982771&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"48a5a6de675c241be4bd986b7fd90c56df31701acdf0f96e9ee2807295d03eb7","category":"Tech"}
