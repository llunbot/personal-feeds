The ‌Apple Watch Series 8‌ has now been discontinued by Apple, and as year-old models, prices at third-party resellers are falling. As such, some customers may be weighing up whether to upgrade to a discounted Series 8‌ or the latest Series 9‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌Apple Watch Series 8‌ and Series 9 share the overwhelming majority of their features, so should you consider buying or sticking with the Series 8 to save money? This breakdown also serves as a way to see all the differences that the new Apple Watch brings to the table.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>‌Apple Watch Series 8‌</th>\r<br />\n <th>‌Apple Watch Series 9‌</th>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Retina display with up to 1,000 nits of brightness</td>\r<br />\n <td>Retina display with up to 2,000 nits of brightness</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td></td>\r<br />\n <td>Display can get dimmer in dark rooms and at night (down to 1 nit of brightness)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td></td>\r<br />\n <td>Double Tap gesture to stop a timer, play and pause music, snooze an alarm, answer and end a phone call, take a photo with the Camera Remote, open the Smart Stack, and scroll through widgets in the stack, all without touching the display</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>S8 chip (based on A13 Bionic chip)</td>\r<br />\n <td>S9 chip (based on A15 Bionic chip: 60% more transistors, 30% faster)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Neural Engine</td>\r<br />\n <td>4-core Neural Engine (up to twice as fast)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> processed in the cloud via internet connection</td>\r<br />\n <td>‌Siri‌ processed on-device for requests that do not need information from the internet, resulting in quicker and more reliable responses</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td></td>\r<br />\n <td>‌Siri‌ can access health and fitness data</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Dictation</td>\r<br />\n <td>25% more accurate dictation</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>First-generation Ultra Wideband chip</td>\r<br />\n <td>Second-generation Ultra Wideband chip</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td></td>\r<br />\n <td>Precision Finding for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> models, providing distance and direction, as well as visual, haptic, and audio guidance to a misplaced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a></td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td></td>\r<br />\n <td><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> integration: When a user gets within four meters of a playing ‌HomePod‌, the Apple Watch launches Now Playing to control playback.

As a result, it is very difficult to recommend upgrading.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMost ‌Apple Watch Series 8‌ users will not be able to justify upgrading to the Series 9, but some customers coming from an older device could still have good reason to preference the latest model, namely those who heavily use a ‌HomePod‌, plan to buy an ‌iPhone 15‌ model and can take advantage of Precision Finding, need additional storage for downloaded media, or think one-handed use with the Double Tap gesture would be useful.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌Apple Watch Series 9‌ is very similar to the Series 8, so most customers who have an older Apple Watch model and are looking for an upgrade may prefer to look for a discounted ‌Apple Watch Series 8‌. If the Series 8 can be found for a substantially lower price, it remains a solid buy for most users with an older model.
