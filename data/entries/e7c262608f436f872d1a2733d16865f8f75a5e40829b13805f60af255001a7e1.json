And when it does, it’s often not just one thing, but a whole range of catastrophes. Plus it usually happens on the wettest, coldest ride of the year – or the hottest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common, of course, is a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/the-cyclist-guide-to-inner-tube-repair\" target=\"_blank\">puncture</a>, but everything from loose bolts to a broken chain can wreck your ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you don’t want to have to call out the broom wagon or that’s not an option, it’s worth carrying the items you need to handle most problems and get you moving again. The good news is that, if you pick the right item, almost everything you need can be found in a really compact design that won’t see your pockets sagging or add too much extra weight.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-handlebar-bag\">Best bar bags: Handlebar bags reviewed</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-pack-your-bike-bags\">Opinion: Pack your bike bags</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-pack-your-cycling-jersey-pockets-like-a-pro\">How to pack your cycling jersey pockets and saddle bag like a pro</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-keep-cycling-through-winter\">Cycling in winter: Top tips for riding outside in the cold months</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/the-cyclist-guide-to-inner-tube-repair\">How to repair a puncture</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>So here is a rundown of the essentials to keep you riding through (almost) every eventuality.

They’re expensive, but much lighter and more compact than a standard tube. If you have to use it, you can always replace it when you get home. Consider it an investment in additional carrying capacity.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tubolito Inner Tube (<a href=\"https://fave.co/3MOhQ6u\" target=\"_blank\">£27.99 at Condor Cycles</a>)</strong><br /><strong>Vittoria TPU Inner tube (<a href=\"https://fave.co/3OP4J7C\" target=\"_blank\">£29.99 at Condor Cycles</a>)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Tyre levers</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"733\" height=\"489\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02131845/park_tool_levers.jpg\" alt=\"park_tool_levers\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02131845/park_tool_levers.jpg 733w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02131845/park_tool_levers-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02131845/park_tool_levers-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02131845/park_tool_levers-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Although you can often remove a tyre from a wheel rim and fix a puncture <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-change-bike-tyre-inner-tube-without-levers\" target=\"_blank\">without tyre levers</a>, these will certainly make it easier. It’s worth carrying a pair of reasonably sturdy tyre levers, particularly if you have a tight tyre-rim combination, which can snap cheaper, lighter-weight plastic levers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a pinch, a hex wrench from a multitool or a key can help you lever the tyre off. Just don’t use the business end of the key; a bent or snapped key will compound your tyre problems by locking you out once you get home. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Park Tool Tyre Lever Set (<a href=\"https://www.wiggle.com/p/park-tool-tyre-lever-set-tl-1-2\" target=\"_blank\">£4.99 at Wiggle</a>)</strong><br /><strong><strong>Pedros Tyre Lever Set</strong> (<a href=\"https://fave.co/3OP4J7C\" target=\"_blank\">£4.99 at Tredz</a>)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Instant patches</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"600\" height=\"520\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/02150850/park_tool_super_patch.jpeg\" alt=\"park_tool_super_patch\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/02150850/park_tool_super_patch.jpeg 600w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/02150850/park_tool_super_patch-300x260.jpeg 300w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While your spare tube will resolve most tyre problems, what happens if you get a second flat? It can happen, particularly if there’s a tiny piece of flint or glass embedded in your tyre that’s hard to spot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s useful to have a few <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-puncture-repair-kits\" target=\"_blank\">instant patches</a> with you as an insurance policy. They’re very lightweight and compact. The critical part is good preparation of the tube surface, then applying the patch without getting any wrinkles in it. If you’re running modern wider tyres at a lower <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-tyre-pressure\" target=\"_blank\">tyre pressure</a>, an instant patch is more likely to make an airtight seal than with a tyre run at higher pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Park Tool Super Patches (<a href=\"https://www.tweekscycles.com/park-tool-gp2-super-patch-kit-madqkgp02/\" target=\"_blank\">£2.69 at Tweeks Cycles</a>)</strong><br /><strong>Slime Skabs Patch Kit  (<a href=\"https://fave.co/3OP4J7C\" target=\"_blank\">£3.98 at Halfords</a>)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4.

Although it’s wonderful stuff, don’t assume that sealant will solve every puncture problem. Some holes are just too large for the sealant to close, in which case a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/how-to-repair-a-tubeless-tyre-with-a-plug\" target=\"_blank\">tubeless tyre plug</a> can help to fill it and give the sealant something to coagulate around. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll also need a reamer to push the plug into your tyre. Some multitools now include the necessary tool and even the plug, avoiding having yet another thing to carry. Even then, it’s a good idea to have a pump and inner tube as a last resort. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dynaplug Racer Tubeless Repair Kit (<a href=\"https://www.tweekscycles.com/dynaplug-racer-ultralight-tyre-repair-kit-holder-maddp0033/\" target=\"_blank\">£31.49 at Tweeks Cycles</a>)</strong><br /><strong>Stan’s Dart Tubeless Repair Kit (<a href=\"https://fave.co/3OP4J7C\" target=\"_blank\">£22.50 at Wiggle</a>)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.

It’s tempting to look for the smallest, lightest pump you can get; after all, most of the time it’s just dead weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when you do need to use your pump, it needs to be efficient enough that you’re not spending half an hour by the roadside trying to get a rideable amount of air in your tyre and a larger pump will almost always be more efficient. Fortunately, we’ve tested a whole range of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-mini-pump\" target=\"_blank\">best mini pumps</a>, so you can read how well a whole range of pumps performed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A CO2 inflator can make things easier, but it’s a one-hit option and it’s hardly the sustainable choice. If you get another flat or your tube still has a hole in it, you don’t have a Plan B unless you’re carrying multiple CO2 cartridges.

A couple of times now, I’ve found that the top of the valve in my spare tube protrudes just far enough out of the valve hole in the rim that I can see it, but not enough to actually attach a pump and get any air into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth buying a spare tube with as long a valve as you can find to avoid the problem if you decide to buy a new aero wheelset, but a valve extender is a light, easy way to make a shorter valve stem accessible, even in a deep section wheel, so I’ve now added that to my ride pack. </p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>7. A multitool</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/01/03073720/merida-reacto-4000-multitool-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"merida-reacto-4000-multitool\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-cycling-multitools\" target=\"_blank\">multitool </a>is a very useful thing to have along if something works loose. A slipping seatpost bolt is a prime candidate, but depending on how well you’ve maintained your bike, everything from chainring bolts to derailleurs to pedals can work loose. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But just any multitool won’t do, as I was reminded when I got a flat on a ride recently. If your bike has <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-cyclist-guide-to-road-bike-disc-brakes\" target=\"_blank\">disc brakes</a>, chances are that it will also have thru-axles rather than quick releases. Some thru-axles include levers to loosen them, but increasingly they just have a 6mm hex bolt. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My multitool didn’t include a 6mm hex and this is not an uncommon problem with older multitools. Make sure yours has all the tools you need to tackle the majority of bolts on your bike. Torx bolts are another item that some multitools don’t cover. A flat-format multitool is useful, as it doesn’t take up too much room in a pocket or ride pack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Topeak Mini Pro 20 Multitool (<a href=\"https://fave.co/3MOhQ6u\" target=\"_blank\">£29.99 at Wiggle</a>)</strong><br /><strong>Pedros RX Micro-9 Multitool (<a href=\"https://www.tredz.co.uk/.Pedros-RX-Micro-9-Multi-Tool_227021.htm?\" target=\"_blank\">£31.49 at Tredz</a>)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8.

A few years ago, one particular chain design seemed to be particularly prone to breaking, but I’ve not had chain problems for a while. You’re more likely to break a chain while riding on gravel, where the stresses on it are greater than on the road and it’s more likely to get twisted around a branch or other obstacle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your chain does break, a chain tool will allow you to repair it and keep moving, otherwise it’s game over. At a pinch, you can remove a whole link, then replace it once you get home, but a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-use-chain-quick-links\" target=\"_blank\">quick link</a>, as the name suggests, is a quicker and easier way to get going again; simply punch out the damaged chain link and insert the missing link in its place. They’re designed so that they’ll close without a tool, although most are now officially single-use, so you can’t remove them again for reuse once you get home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve wrecked your derailleur at the same time, you can shorten your chain and ride your bike as a single-speed, although it’s difficult to get the chain tension right with a thru-axle or standard quick-release drop out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re riding one of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-groupsets\" target=\"_blank\">latest groupsets</a>, make sure that your chain tool will work with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-chain\" target=\"_blank\">12-speed chains</a> and doesn’t top out at 10 or 11-speed.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lezyne V Pro 13 Multitool (<a href=\"https://www.tweekscycles.com/lezyne-v-pro-13-multi-tool-upgl-1-mt-vpro-13t04/\" target=\"_blank\">£32.99 at Tweeks Cycles</a>)</strong><br /><strong>Brooks MT21 Multitool (<a href=\"https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/p/brooks-england-mt21-muli-tool?\" target=\"_blank\">£49.99 at Chain Reaction Cycles</a>)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>10.
