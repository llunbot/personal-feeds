According to Reuters, NewsBreak's AI tool, which scrapes the web and helps rewrite local news stories, has been used to publish at least 40 misleading or erroneous stories since 2021.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029287#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029287&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bb3327601faecfea20f3980db96b5c760c9192e840a97601e9571361ebb5f017","category":"Tech"}
