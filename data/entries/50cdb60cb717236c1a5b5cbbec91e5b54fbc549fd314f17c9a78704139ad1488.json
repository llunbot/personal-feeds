It can share data with many top tracking apps and platforms, like Strava, Komoot, and TrainingPeaks. The battery lasts up to 35 hours of fully featured tracking, or up to 70 hours in battery save mode. </p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/garmin-edge-1040-gps-computer\" target=\"_blank\">Shop Now</a>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/garmin-forerunner-965\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Garmin Forerunner 965 GPS Watch</strong></a></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"356\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-3-800x356.png\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-3-800x356.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-3-297x132.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-3-120x53.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-3-768x341.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-3-1536x683.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-3-2048x910.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Garmin Forerunner 965 is made for runners and triathletes who crave performance and recovery data.

A two-bike rack comes with a pivot that can be activated by hand or foot, while an end-pull handle on the add-ons lets you lower the rack more readily.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rack’s arms are designed to secure bike tires but are also coated to protect your bike’s paint from incidental dings. Low-profile integrated LED tail lights pair with your vehicle for rear visibility and safety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Piston Pro X has a Flatlock hitch cam with a lockable install for a more secure, wobble-free ride. The rack’s modular QuickConnect design means there’s room for adding another bike (or two).

The experience should be more immersive, with a wider pedal stroke analysis compatibility. Riders may notice it runs quieter and provides more accurate measurements of your speed, cadence, and power. (Garmin claims a maximum deviation of 1% of your data.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trainer is ready to go out of the box, no calibration is needed. It has a virtual flywheel and can handle 2,200W of max power and incline up to 25%. </p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/garmin-tacx-neo-2t-smart-direct-drive-trainer\" target=\"_blank\">Shop Now</a>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/zipp-303-s-tubeless-carbon-disc-brake-wheelset\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>ZIPP 303 S Tubeless Carbon Disc Brake Wheelset</strong></a></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-6.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-6-800x533.png\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-6-800x533.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-6-297x198.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-6-120x80.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-6-768x512.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-6-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-6-2048x1366.png 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-6-720x480.png 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Zipp’s 303 S Firecrest Tubeless Disc-brake wheelset is among its lightest, with a priority on aero performance while riding on 28mm tires. However, it can fit gravel tires up to 50mm wide, too. The 303s are made for tubeless tires and disc-brake bikes, for lower pressure races that run on and off paved surfaces. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Spring Classics in its heritage, the 303 wheelset strives to perform on all terrain. There’s still the 45mm rim depth from the 302 disc brake, yet the external rim width grows 2 mm to 27 mm and the internal width grows by 7 mm to a 23mm internal depth. The goal of these changes is to improve performance and ride quality to the tune of 10W savings versus similar wheels in terms of the total power required on flat roads, according to Zipps.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/zipp-303-s-tubeless-carbon-disc-brake-wheelset\" target=\"_blank\">Shop Now</a>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/giro-aries-spherical-mips-road-helmet?sesgl=1&amp;ssn=3544666?utm_source=gearjunkie&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=2023_holiday_gift_guide\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Giro Aries Spherical MIPS Road Helmet</strong></a></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-7.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-7-800x533.png\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-7-800x533.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-7-297x198.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-7-120x80.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-7-768x512.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-7-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-7-2048x1366.png 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-7-720x480.png 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A top-of-the-line model from Giro, the Aries Spherical MIPS Road Helmet is a compact design with plenty of ventilation and protection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giro’s Spherical Technology is a ball-and-socket design powered by Mips that can redirect energy away from the brain in certain impacts.

Outside, the shoe has a PU-laminated upper that pairs with a GORE-TEX Koala membrane designed to optimize breathability, so sweat vapor can escape without letting water in. A Velcro strap helps keep the ankle in place, while the L6 BOA dial allows for smaller adjustments on the fly, even with gloved hands.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/fizik-r5-artica-gtx-road-shoe\" target=\"_blank\">Shop Now</a>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/castelli-mens-estremo-glove\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Castelli Estremo Glove</strong></a></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9-800x533.png\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9-800x533.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9-297x198.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9-120x80.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9-768x512.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9-2048x1366.png 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9-720x480.png 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Protect your hands this winter with these windstopping, weather-resistant gloves.
