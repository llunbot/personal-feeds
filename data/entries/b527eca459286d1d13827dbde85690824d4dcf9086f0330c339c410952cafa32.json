The ‌iPad Air‌ now comes in two sizes like the ‌iPad Pro‌, the ninth-generation $329 ‌iPad‌ has been discontinued, and Apple has dropped the price of the standard 10th-generation ‌iPad‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/ipad-lineup-2024.jpg\" width=\"2703\" height=\"1520\" />\r<br />\nApple's full lineup with starting prices:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>13-inch iPad Pro</strong> - $1,299</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>11-inch iPad Pro</strong> - $999</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>13-inch iPad Air</strong> - $799</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>11-inch iPad Air</strong> - $599</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>10.9-inch iPad</strong> - $349 (down from $449)</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>8.3-inch iPad mini</strong> - $499</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nThe low-cost ‌iPad‌ now starts at $349 instead of $329 because the ninth-generation ‌iPad‌ has been discontinued, but the 10th-generation model has A14 chip instead of the older A13 chip. All of the ‌iPad‌ models can be updated with additional storage space, which increases the price. The high-end 2TB 13-inch ‌iPad Pro‌, for example, is $2,299, and even more expensive with nano-texture glass and cellular connectivity.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple introduced a new Magic Keyboard and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> Pro to go along with the ‌iPad Pro‌ models. The ‌iPad Pro‌ and ‌iPad Air‌ can be ordered as of today.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/\">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-full-ipad-lineup/\">Here's Apple's Full iPad Lineup With New iPad Pro and iPad Air Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-apples-full-ipad-lineup-with-new-ipad-pro-and-ipad-air-models.2425633/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b527eca459286d1d13827dbde85690824d4dcf9086f0330c339c410952cafa32","category":"Apple"}
