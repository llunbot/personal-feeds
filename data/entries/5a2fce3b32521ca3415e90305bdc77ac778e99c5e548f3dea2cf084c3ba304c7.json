From Apple's <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-apple-vision-pro/\">press release</a> announcing the Vision Pro headset:<blockquote>Featuring Apple's first three-dimensional camera, Apple Vision Pro lets users capture, relive, and immerse themselves in favorite memories with Spatial Audio. Every spatial photo and video transports users back to a moment in time, like a celebration with friends or a special family gathering. Users can access their entire photo library on iCloud, and view their photos and videos at a life-size scale with brilliant color and spectacular detail.</blockquote>Standard photos and videos from an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or another device can still be viewed on the headset, but the 3D images and videos are considerably more immersive and can only be captured using a Vision Pro itself. The feature is so central to the Vision Pro experience that the device has a dedicated mechanical button on the top to activate it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/vision-pro-3d-video.jpg\" alt width=\"1492\" height=\"839\" /><em>Spatial video playback in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a>.</em></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn light of the latest rumor, it seems possible that this \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/07/apple-vision-hardware/\">three-dimensional camera</a>\" could be headed to the ‌iPhone‌, likely adding further hardware to the existing rear camera configuration that consists of a main wide camera, telephoto camera, ultra wide camera, LiDAR scanner, and Adaptive True Tone flash. The Weibo user cautioned that additional information about the new ‌iPhone‌ capability is currently incomplete, suggesting that there may be more to follow.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is also worth noting that the \"‌iPhone Ultra‌\" moniker has been frequently used across Chinese social media platforms when discussing a future \"Pro Max\" model following rumors that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/25/iphone-15-ultra-replacing-pro-max-model/\">planning to rename</a> the device earlier this year. The change is no longer expected to occur this year, but according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, Apple could release a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/05/gurman-new-top-of-the-line-iphone/\">new high-end device</a> called the \"‌iPhone Ultra‌,\" sitting above the \"Pro Max\" in the lineup, as soon as next year. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset is set to launch in early 2024.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-ultra/\">iPhone Ultra</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/setsuna-digital/\">Setsuna Digital</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/future-iphone-could-capture-spatial-photos-videos/\">Future 'iPhone Ultra' Model Could Capture Spatial Photos and Videos for Vision Pro Headset</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/future-iphone-ultra-model-could-capture-spatial-photos-and-videos-for-vision-pro-headset.2400413/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5a2fce3b32521ca3415e90305bdc77ac778e99c5e548f3dea2cf084c3ba304c7","category":"Apple"}
