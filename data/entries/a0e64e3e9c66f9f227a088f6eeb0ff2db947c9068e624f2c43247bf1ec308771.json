Don’t miss our guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/guide-to-olympic-cycling-how-to-watch/\">how to watch the Olympic track cycling</a>, not to mention our primer covering every <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/track-cycling-explained/\">track cycling discipline</a> and our guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/track-cycling-bikes-explained/\">Olympic track bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>One of our biggest stories this week was the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/danish-track-team-shin-tape/\">Danish track squad’s controversial use of shin tape</a> – a possible aerodynamic advantage that led to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/danish-track-team-shin-tape-update/\">complaints being lodged against the team</a>.</p>\n<p>We also got a look at <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/hope-hb-tt-time-trial-bike-prototype/\">Hope’s extraordinary HB.TT</a>, a road-going time trial version of the brand’s cutting-edge <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/hope-hb-t/\">HB.T track bike</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, in ultra-cycling news, we got the lowdown on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/christina-mackenzie-lejog-record/\">Christina Mackenzie’s incredible and record-breaking Land’s End to John o’Groats ride</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s not all been skinny tyres pumped up to a billion psi, though. Hope also made headlines with its all-new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/hope-union-pedals/\">Union mountain bike pedals</a>, an SPD-esque design that rather surprisingly uses an entirely proprietary cleat, while we published our reviews of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-xx1-eagle-axs-review/\">SRAM’s XX1 Eagle AXS groupset</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/cane-creek-helm-mkii-coil-29-review/\">Cane Creek Helm MKII fork</a>.</p>\n<h2>Albion Ultralight Insulated Jacket</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Albion’s Ultralight jacket offers an unusual combination of features.</span></figcaption><span> <i>J Loveridge</i></span></div>\n<p>The Ultralight Insulated Jacket from Albion offers a pretty unusual combination of features.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, it’s a highly packable outer shell made from breathable ripstop fabric with a DWR coating, which Albion says is shower-resistant rather than waterproof.</p>\n<p>On the other, it’s got insulated sections on the front of the chest and arms, suggesting it’s suitable for pretty low temperatures.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Albion packs down to approximately the size of a small Jack Russell’s head.</span></figcaption><span> <i>J Loveridge</i></span></div>\n<p>It really does pack down tiny. While many riders will likely opt to put it straight in a pocket, Albion supplies a little stuff sack that will be handy for those taking the jacket bikepacking.</p>\n<p>At 88g for a size extra-small, it’s not going to weigh you down and it offers a nice racy fit too, so it won’t undermine your carefully curated roadie wardrobe.</p>\n<p>We’re intrigued as to how well the Ultralight will work in the real world. Here at BikeRadar we’re big fans of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/best-gore-tex-shakedry-cycling-rain-jackets/\">Gore-Tex Shakedry</a> jackets, but they’re very expensive and usually don’t offer much in the way of insulation on their own.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There are toggles on either side to cinch the waist in.</span></figcaption><span> <i>J Loveridge</i></span></div>\n<p>The Albion isn’t waterproof so it’s not exactly a direct rival for those, but it’s quite a bit cheaper and could be a great solution for riding in unpredictable weather, something that’s never in short supply.</p>\n<ul><li>£145</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.albioncycling.com/product/ultralight-insulated-jacket-burnt-yellow-men/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now from Albion</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Falke cycling socks</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The BC Impulse Peloton socks are a premium-priced option that feel really nicely made.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Cyclists are the only people who regard socks as a genuine treat rather than a backup option when you can’t think of anything else to buy as a gift – we love us some fresh foot gloves.</p>\n<p>Falke is a large German brand that makes all manner of everyday clothing alongside sport-specific products, including cycling socks.</p>\n<p>The BC Impulse Peloton socks are a premium-priced option that claims to offer “permanent massage” for your feet via the use of a mesh knit section under the ball of the foot.</p>\n<p>They’re made from a typical polyamide/elastane blend that’s designed to keep you cool and wick sweat away effectively.</p>\n<p>These come in a choice of five colours, all featuring a pattern said to be reminiscent of a peloton viewed from above.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/Falke-socks-a181f2e.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The BC Impulse Reflective adds in a little bit of reflectivity. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/Falke-socks-3-38717e8.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Permanent massage, anyone?
