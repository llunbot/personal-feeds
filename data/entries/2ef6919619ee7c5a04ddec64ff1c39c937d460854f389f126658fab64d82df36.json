Note that you'll need to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/download-ios-17-beta-iphone/\">download the iOS 17.2 beta</a> for this to work, otherwise you won't see the Listening History filter option. \r<br />\n<ol><li>Go to <strong>Settings ➝ Focus</strong> on your ‌iPhone‌.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap the <strong>+</strong> button in the top-right corner to create a new Focus, then tap <strong>Custom</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Give your new Focus an identifiable name, symbol, and color, then tap <strong>Next</strong>.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-music-listening-history-focus2.jpg\" alt=\"focus\" width=\"4137\" height=\"2716\" />\r<br />\n</li><li>Tap <strong>Customize Focus</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Scroll down to \"Focus Filters,\" ten tap <strong>Add Filter</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Choose the <strong>Music</strong> filter.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Make sure the button is off next to <strong>Use Listening History</strong>, then tap <strong>Add</strong>.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-music-listening-history-focus1.jpg\" alt=\"focus\" width=\"4137\" height=\"2716\" /></li></ol>That's all there is to it. The next time music is going to be played for someone else on your ‌iPhone‌, simply swipe down from the top-right corner of the screen to bring up Control Center and long press on the Focus button to select the Focus you created. Rest assured that whatever they play after that, won't play havoc with your ‌Apple Music‌ algorithms.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOf course, if you don't feel like you benefit from ‌Apple Music‌'s personal recommendations, and you don't have an ‌Apple Music‌ profile where your listening history is shared, you can disable Listening History more permanently by going to <strong>Settings ➝ Music</strong> and toggling off the switch next to <strong>Use Listening History</strong>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/apple-music-listening-history-focus-filter/\">How to Stop Your Kids From Ruining Your Apple Music Recommendations</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-stop-your-kids-from-ruining-your-apple-music-recommendations.2409735/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2ef6919619ee7c5a04ddec64ff1c39c937d460854f389f126658fab64d82df36","category":"Apple"}
