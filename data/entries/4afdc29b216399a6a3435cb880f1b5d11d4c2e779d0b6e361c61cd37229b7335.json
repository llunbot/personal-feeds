Now a new guidebook will help bikepackers do just that. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Bikepacking Scotland</em> is the second book by <a href=\"https://bikepackingscotland.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BikepackingScotland.com</a> founder, bikepacking adventuerer, and stunning filmaker Markus Stitz. The first was <em><a href=\"https://road.cc/content/review/great-british-gravel-rides-markus-stitz-298147\" target=\"_blank\">Great British Gravel Rides</a>, </em>published last year<em>. </em>In his most recent volume, Stitz concentrates on the country he’s called home for 14 years, getting cyclists further off the main roads and onto tracks less travelled. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><em>Bikepacking Scotland</em> — a guidebook for adventurous cyclists</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scotland.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scotland-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"the front cover of Bikepacking Scotland \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scotland-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scotland-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scotland-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scotland-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scotland-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scotland-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scotland-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scotland-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>For me, cycling is one of the purest ways to discover Scotland off the beaten track, leaving no other trace than a few tire marks. All the bikepacking adventures I have had in Scotland have created lasting memories, even though at times it was a steep learning experience</em>,” Stitz said in a press release. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>Scotland isn’t an easy country to cycle in when it throws its weather at you. You will fondly remember the first time you sink your feet into its famous bog, or when a cloud of midges surrounds you. But you will also be blown away by the wonderful scenery, no matter where you go</em>,” the author continued. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though Scotland is roughly the size of South Carolina, you won’t be stuck for route choices. <em>Bikepacking Scotland</em> offers 20 multi-day routes in a range of difficulties, lengths, and bike types — road, gravel, and mountain bike-friendly routes are all represented.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scotland-3.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scotland-3-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"two people stare out at a loch at the bottom of two peaks \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scotland-3-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scotland-3-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scotland-3-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scotland-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scotland-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scotland-3-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scotland-3-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scotland-3-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption><em>Bikepacking Scotland </em>offers a range of routes for riders of all types. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a news story, not a review — I haven’t read the book and can’t vouch for things like if the stated difficulties align with reality, or if the information presented is accurate. But I like that the routes <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/film-wild-about-bikepacking-scotland/\" target=\"_blank\">cover the whole country</a> and offer experiences from epic Highland pedaling in Cairngorms National Park to whisky-sipping rides on Islay. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Each route in the book comes with a description, an overview map, points of interest, food and lodging recommendations, and a link to downloadable GPX file.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gkVPiESE-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"587\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gkVPiESE-800x587.jpeg\" alt=\"a photo of a book open, with photographs on one side and information on the other\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gkVPiESE-800x587.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gkVPiESE-297x218.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gkVPiESE-120x88.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gkVPiESE-768x563.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gkVPiESE-1536x1126.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gkVPiESE-2048x1502.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>A sample page from <em>Bikepacking Scotland</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stitz also went out of his way to plan carbon-friendly routes — a choice that also benefits travelers in the country who may not have access to a car.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>Fourteen of the routes are directly accessible by train or bus services that transport bikes, four routes start and finish within two kilometers from a train or bus station, and only two itineraries require a longer cycle to either start or finish,</em>” the book’s press materials state. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Bikepacking Scotland </em>officially drops later this week on May 18, timed to coincide with Scotland’s hosting of the <a href=\"https://www.uci.org/uci-cycling-world-championships/1u2anKu29AdUHFHsLHqXuU\" target=\"_blank\">Cycling World Championships</a>.
