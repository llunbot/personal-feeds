Its performance and range of functions are first-class, while the new OLED display saves on weight and makes a flatter chassis possible,” we wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M4 chip on this tablet really makes it shine, allowing it to deliver a performance that’s well above what we saw in previous iPad Pro models.
