All things considered, Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates) liked what he saw.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s pretty great. It’s a complete course from the first to the last stage,” Pogačar said. “We have everything: sprints, small climbs, big climbs, echelons, time trials, cobblestones. I am really looking forward to it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pogačar’s all-rounder skill set should come in handy on a course that features both brutal climbs like the Alpe d’Huez and also 53 km of time trialing, a balanced combination in the context of recent editions of the race. That said, he was hesitant to say outright that it was a route well-designed for his talents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don’t know if the course suits me, but I think it’s a nice route,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was particularly wary of the cobblestones that await on stage 5 and the wind likely to assail the peloton on a number of different stages. He noted that he doesn’t mind cobblestones, but that luck can have a big impact on the way things play out on the pavé, and the same is true for stages buffeted by wind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I will do some recon, because it will be necessary. I am pretty excited. The windy stages are always tricky,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Everybody is nervous for those stages, and it will be interesting to see what happens. When you have a 20-kilometer-long bridge [on stage 2], it’s rare that nothing happens. It will be scary.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, the variety of the 2022 Tour de France route will provide plenty of different opportunities for riders to gain time on their rivals – or to lose it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Pogačar put it: “You can lose the race pretty fast.”</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/10/tadej-pogacar-likes-the-2022-tour-route-but-hes-wary-of-wind-and-cobbles/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"1bc0fdbe70995fa8124854d44834be4a901a343edf800918cc5e1ae6855fcc1c","category":"Cycling"}
