What we haven’t heard about is the range of new color finishes… until now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing <a href=\"https://majinbuofficial.com/the-new-iphone-17-pro-color/\">on his own website</a> Monday, the well-known leaker Majin Bu claimed Apple has been working on a variety of new hues for this year’s new phones, and that the “current frontrunner” for release in the fall is sky blue. “Unless Apple changes course at the last minute,” he writes confidently, “this will be the star of the September 2025 launch event.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sky blue represents a change of direction for the Pro line of iPhones, which for the past three years have been offered in a range of somber, sensible colors. Where the 14 Pro came in gold, silver, black, and a very dark and subtle purple, the 15 Pro’s titanium finish introduced white, black, and natural titanium, along with a very dark blue. The 16 Pro has the same three titanium finishes plus Desert Titanium, a sandy gold. None offered anything as vibrant and colorful as sky blue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last time such a color appeared on an iPhone Pro was in 2021 when the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/450981/iphone-13-pro-review.html\">iPhone 13 Pro</a> was available in Sierra Blue. But Majin Bu insists the new sky-blue finish “reportedly looks even more stunning,” at least in early prototypes, “with a brightness and refinement that make it irresistible.” Sounds promising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than the 13 Pro, however, the leaker claims the inspiration for this year’s new color comes from the popular MacBook Air (which at the time of writing is going for its <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2733796/the-hot-new-sky-blue-m4-macbook-air-drops-to-its-best-price-yet.html\">best price yet</a>). In our review, we described the new color as “lighter than the Blue iMac” but still “a nice shade that looks fine on a laptop.” Of note, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2628147/the-macs-space-gray-era-is-officially-over.html\">dropped Space Gray</a> from the lineup, which was once a staple color of the iPhone and Mac lines. The current Air is also available in standard silver, Starlight, and Midnight, so it’s possible Apple could adopt similar terminology if the plan goes ahead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all the latest news and rumors about the new phones coming in late 2025, bookmark our regularly updated <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17</a> superguide.
