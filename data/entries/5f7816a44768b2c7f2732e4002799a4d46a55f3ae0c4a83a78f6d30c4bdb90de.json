The cheapest version of the Pocket Reform starts at $899, and it's also being offered in purple for $969 or in a bundle with a 1TB SSD, carrying case, handbook, and poster for $1,299. All versions are currently slated to ship in mid-October.</p>\n\n<p>Crowdfunded hardware projects have a pretty spotty record when it comes to actually shipping products, but MNT used essentially the same funding strategy for the full-size Reform <a href=\"https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/reform\">back in 2018</a>.</p>\n<p>Like the full-size Reform, the pocket version uses open source hardware and a mechanical keyboard (buyers can choose either white or red Kalih switches). But the pocket version uses a 7-inch 1920Ã—1200 LCD screen instead of a 12.5-inch version and comes with fewer and smaller ports (two USB-C, one micro HDMI, a microSD port, and one ix industrial mini Ethernet port). Its keyboard also comes with an individually programmable RGB backlight, and its trackball-style pointing device has been downsized to fit into the smaller design.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924164#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924164&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5f7816a44768b2c7f2732e4002799a4d46a55f3ae0c4a83a78f6d30c4bdb90de","category":"Tech"}
