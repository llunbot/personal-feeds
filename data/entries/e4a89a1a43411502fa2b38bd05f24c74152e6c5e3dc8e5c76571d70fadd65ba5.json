Over the weekend, 16-year-old Michael \"dopgplayingtetris\" Artiaga became the first to reach an even more impressive plateau in the game, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXhbti5SneE%22\">looping past Level 255</a> and instantly rolling the game all the way back to the ultra-slow Level 0.</p>\n<p>It took Artiaga a bit over 80 minutes and a full 3,300 cleared lines to finally achieve the game's first near-mythical \"rebirth\" <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2268738212\">live in front of hundreds of Twitch viewers</a>. And after a bit of celebration and recovery on the low levels, Artiaga managed to keep his rolled-over game going for another 40 minutes, finally topping out after a total of 4,216 lines and a record 29.4 million points.</p>\n<div><div></div><div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div>\n      Artiaga's record-setting game starts a few minutes in, while the \"rebirth\" rollover happens at 1:21:24\n\n          </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Artiaga's record does come with a small asterisk since he used a version of the game that was modified to avoid the crashes that stopped Blue Scuti's historic run. Still, NES <em>Tetris</em>' first-ever level rollover is a monumental achievement and a testament to just how far competitive classic Tetris has come in a short time.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/nes-tetris-first-ever-rebirth-loops-past-level-255-and-back-to-zero/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/nes-tetris-first-ever-rebirth-loops-past-level-255-and-back-to-zero/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e4a89a1a43411502fa2b38bd05f24c74152e6c5e3dc8e5c76571d70fadd65ba5","category":"Tech"}
