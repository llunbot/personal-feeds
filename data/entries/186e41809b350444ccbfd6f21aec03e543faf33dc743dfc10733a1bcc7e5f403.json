Falsehoods and conspiracy theories bubble up on everything from the weather to vaccines to the shape of the Earth. Purveyors of this garbage may be motivated by attention, money, or simply the appeal of sticking it to the educated elite. For people who try to keep both feet planted in the real world, it's enough to make you want to scream. Even if you spend 24 hours a day pushing back against the <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/386/\">wrongness on the Internet</a>, it seems impossible to make a dent in it.</p>\n<p>I've been pondering this, and I've decided that we need a way to target the worst sources of misinformationâ€”a way to identify the people who are both the most wrong and the most dangerous. So, as a bit of a thought experiment, I started playing with a simplified scoring system for misinformation merchants.</p>\n<p>I'm calling it the 10-point Ladapo scale in honor of the surgeon general of Florida, for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/florida-surgeon-general-wrong-on-vaccines-and-bad-at-his-job-cdc-and-fda-say/\">reasons I hope are obvious</a>. Any person can be given a score of zero or one (fractions are discouraged) for each of the following questions; scores are then totaled to provide a composite picture of just how bad any source is. To help you understand how to use it, we'll go through the questions and provide a sense of how each should be scored. We'll then apply the Ladapo scale to a couple of real-world examples.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970465#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970465&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"186e41809b350444ccbfd6f21aec03e543faf33dc743dfc10733a1bcc7e5f403","category":"Tech"}
