At the time, it felt like a challenge because the bike industry seemed to have relegated metal materials to entry-level bikes or niche adventure bikes from boutique brands. Then I stumbled across the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/weve-got-lions-onguza-and-ben-ingham-2024-launch/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Onguza: Made Out Here</i></a> video on YouTube.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><span><span></span></span><span></span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Miguel did a video version of this review, if you’re into that, too…</em></p>\n<p>It was a masterclass in advertising, and I was immediately in love with the bikes and the expanse of Namibia. The video said absolutely nothing about the bikes, but it perfectly evoked that feeling of exploring the unknown, getting lost in a remote land, and immersing oneself in a new culture. I knew I had to learn everything I could and try to get my hands on one.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-70.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-70.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-70.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-70.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I started the process of getting an Onguza bike almost a year ago, and I want to point out that this is <b>my</b> bike. I paid for it. I think it’s important to mention that because I want to draw attention to the fact that smaller framebuilders need our support, and the review of this bike comes from my genuine love of riding it and the beautiful people who made this happen.</p>\n<p>And another quick note to all Radavist readers: This is my first <i>written</i> bike review. I don’t have years of experience, and I won’t pretend I do. But this bike is something special, so give me some grace and we’ll suffer through it together, deal?</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-BIke-Show-Onguza-Hardtail-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-BIke-Show-Onguza-Hardtail-2.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-BIke-Show-Onguza-Hardtail-2.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-BIke-Show-Onguza-Hardtail-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-Onguza-29er-Hardtail-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-Onguza-29er-Hardtail-3.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-Onguza-29er-Hardtail-3.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-Onguza-29er-Hardtail-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Two Onguza hardtails John documented at the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/made-bike-show/\" target=\"_blank\">MADE Bike Show</a></em></p>\n<h3>Made Out Here</h3>\n<p>Digging into Onguza’s story, I found Dan Craven, or “<em>Dan from Nam.</em>” Born and raised in Namibia, he’s a former Olympian and World Tour rider who has raced across the globe and made appearances in big stages like La Vuelta España in 2014 for Team Europcar.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/Onguza_SRAM_01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/Onguza_SRAM_01.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/Onguza_SRAM_01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/Onguza_SRAM_01.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Photo via Onguza by SRAM</em></p>\n<p>After retiring from professional cycling, Dan returned to his hometown of Omaruru and co-founded Onguza.

In a country where talented makers often end up doing farm labor or in low-paying jobs, Dan’s vision was to fully utilize their talents to craft luxury handmade bikes. Without previous framebuilding experience, it would be a hard road ahead, but they were up for it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/Onguza_SRAM_07.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/Onguza_SRAM_07.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/Onguza_SRAM_07.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/Onguza_SRAM_07.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/Onguza_SRAM_06.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/Onguza_SRAM_06.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/Onguza_SRAM_06.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/Onguza_SRAM_06.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/Onguza_SRAM_05.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/Onguza_SRAM_05.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/Onguza_SRAM_05.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/Onguza_SRAM_05.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Photos via Onguza by SRAM</em></p>\n<p>Throughout the build process of my bike, Dan shared how Petrus and Sakaria have worked with master framebuilders to perfect their craft. When people ask about my bike, I proudly say, “It’s a custom steel African bike,” a phrase I’m sure they’ve never heard before.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-14.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-14.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Making a Case for Custom Steel</h3>\n<p>People who ride steel bikes don’t need convincing, but I want to speak to the bike-racing, spandex-wearing, carbon lovers out there. We don’t need the latest frame every year. Steel rides beautifully – it’s compliant and stiff in the right areas. For long gravel races, being comfortable makes you fast.</p>\n<p>The marginal gains in weight and aerodynamics from carbon frames are inconsequential for most of us, and the short-lasting lust over new tech fades quickly. I’ll tell you that after six months, every ride on my Onguza feels like a new bike day all over again.</p>\n<p>It’s important to mention that this is a custom fit. This bike was built from measurements of a professional bike fit that I did in Arizona. I want to emphasize the importance of doing one before starting this process. It will guarantee a perfect fit and will also make the life of the framebuilders <i>waaaaay</i> easier. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu9UOkIsiDU\">Here’s a link</a> to my bike fit video.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-94.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-94.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-94.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-94.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-91.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-91.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-91.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-91.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>In a perfect world, this would be the bike I ride until I can’t pedal anymore. But we know that’s not realistic. Riders and their demands change, and although it’s not addressed that often, this might not be my “forever bike”. But it could be someone else’s, ideally my kids’.</p>\n<p>Steel frames last much longer than carbon frames, are repairable and can be stripped and refinished or modified much easier than carbon or aluminum.</p>\n<p><i>“Steel is real,” as the saying goes. If you want to dive into the properties that make steel an innovative material for frame-building, check out Daniel Yang’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDDjyTGY-Lg\">detailed breakdown on YouTube</a>.</i></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-19.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-19.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Ride Quality</h3>\n<p>I can’t dissect angles or tubing diameters; I wish I had the knowledge to dive into that sort of thing. But I can tell you how this bike makes me feel when I’m riding. Whether I’m tackling Northern New Mexico’s chunky gravel or navigating sketchy singletrack with John, this bike stays planted on descents and alive on climbs. It handles washboard sections with ease and goes fast on groomed gravel like our local Rail Trail. Maybe a little too fast for a heavy-traffic social ride, but I’m not surprised, considering the maker.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-21.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-21.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Beyond the fast pedigree lies the true nature of an Onguza bike. It’s built for endurance and is designed to withstand Namibia’s tough desert conditions. Breaking down in the middle of nowhere isn’t an option there – they have lions!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-5.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Race Metal \\m/</h3>\n<p>My first race with the Onguza Goat was in Pueblo, Colorado, at a new race called Grassroots Gravel. This is a super welcoming event consisting of mostly smooth dirt roads with some road sections. The difficulty of the terrain came from the elevation gain on the first 35 miles.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-8.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-8.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-6.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-6.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I did the 75-mile course with around 3,500 feet of climbing in 4 hours 10 minutes. The bike truly shone in the last hour of the race. I felt really comfortable after three and half hours of hard racing, and my position on the bike and the compliance were key to alleviating the fatigue that comes from riding lots of miles.</p>\n<p>A custom fit and a steel bike give me so much confidence to dream about riding Ultras in the future.</p>\n<p><em>Maybe Mega Mid South 2025?

You see them everywhere. They are hardy survivalists who are also cheeky and fun. That feels like a gravel bike to me – and I would like to think that we don’t take ourselves too seriously. I mean, how can you if you idolise a goat!?</p>\n<p>Another thing about the goat is the fact that we come from the country with the highest population of cheetah in the world. We have leopards, elephants, lions and more roaming our landscapes. If I’m lucky I’ll see giraffe on some of my rides from the factory. And yet we celebrate the humble goat and the cow – because as much as Namibia is famous for the wildlife, the people farm with and are proud of their herds. That’s what we want to celebrate.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-Onguza-29er-Hardtail-6.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-Onguza-29er-Hardtail-6.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-Onguza-29er-Hardtail-6.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-Onguza-29er-Hardtail-6.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-BIke-Show-Onguza-Hardtail-18.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-BIke-Show-Onguza-Hardtail-18.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-BIke-Show-Onguza-Hardtail-18.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-BIke-Show-Onguza-Hardtail-18.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-82.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-82.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-82.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-82.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>John’s eye for detail across three Onguza bikes…</em></p>\n<p><strong>How do you select which tubing to use on your bikes?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>“Until now we have almost exclusively been using Columbus tubing and are slowly branching out when the need arises. Due to the distance and resulting shipping costs, we have to be very careful about our shipping strategies and therefore the tubing selection.</p>\n<p>The main differentiator is the down tube and the top tube. On the gravel bike, for large bikes we use a larger diameter top tube than for the smaller bikes. A tapered tube that is 31.7 mm diameter on one end and 28.6 mm on the other. Smaller riders get a top tube that is 28.6 mm throughout.</p>\n<p>The downtube has remained 35 mm throughout on the gravel bikes at the moment, but we have a selection of options with different butting profiles. The main go-to is the Life 35 mm tube, SLFL12650, which is 650 mm long with 0.65 – 0.45 – 0.65 butting profiles. I have been warned that these walls are on the thin side for a gravel bike, but I built my first gravel bike in 2016 with this tube and have yet to have dents from flying rocks be an issue, but I am always wondering when the day will come.</p>\n<p>We always have some 35 mm tubing with a thicker butt on hand in case there is someone larger who wants a bike. I am busy testing out narrower tubes for the downtube, as I have had great success using those on a gravel bike with a lugged steel fork, which rides like a dream on the local corrugated roads.</p>\n<p>Another problem with going to narrower tubes, but using the modern look that comes from a carbon fork, is that almost all modern forks are now 1 1/2″crown race, which necessitates a large head tube, which does not “flow” so nicely with the narrower tubes. So this is all an evolution as I test things out and find the right parts that suit what I want to build.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-16.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-16.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>How do you dial geometry per size and rider needs?

Fortunately for my workload, that happens less these days as I get accustomed to asking all the questions up front instead of piecemeal. The important part is that a customer is comfortable on their current bike and can give me reliable measurements – or has a bike fit with something that they trust and are comfortable with the result.</p>\n<p>I once had a customer do a bike fit on a drop bar bike and wanted a flat bar bike, which devolved into chaos and constant questions. So please don’t ever do that to a builder…</p>\n<p>It all starts with a video call where I get to know the customer and work out why they are ordering a bike and what they want to achieve with it (like the time a guy wanted a gravel bike, but it turned out that he actually wanted a road bike with bigger clearance). One of my favorite questions to get stuck into is previous bikes and what someone liked about them and why. This opens up a load of possibilities and when compared to the riders bike fit info (or their current bike setup measurements) I can work out quite easily if there are some special needs in terms of geometry.</p>\n<p>From all of my years as a professional road racer, where slammed stems were simply expected (the good old days when we knew little), I have now learned that a low front end is usually not a great idea – so I take great pleasure in building a longer head tube (within reason) and reducing spacer stack under the stem. That said, a lot of framebuilders like building bikes with zero spacers, and I really enjoy leaving a spacer or two under the stem. To my eye it does not reduce the appeal of the bike and it does always allow you some extra adjustability – which is something I always enjoy myself.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-89.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-89.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-89.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-89.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-49-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-49-1.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-49-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-49-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Onguza at the 2023 MADE Bike Show</em></p>\n<p><strong>Who paints your bikes, what inspires the designs, and what is the colorway of my bike called?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>“Elvis Presley, believe it or not. Elvis Presley Sageus is our painter, and I am so glad to have our own paint booth on the same property as the little factory. Elvis is the only crew member who only works for us part time as he has his own spray painting business down the road in Omaruru. He used to come with his own assistant, but that didn’t work out so well, and so now one of our junior framebuilders, Sakeus (unusual coincidence with such similar names), helps out in the paint booth when Elvis is in the building.</p>\n<p>This has worked out really well, as we have one person who is in the frame building process and also the painting process, so he understands and works on both processes and can relay information and help us keep tabs on QC between the two departments.</p>\n<p>Your colourway is currently not on the website, so it has the very creative name of “Khaki”. But I am sure that will be changing in the near future ;)</p>\n<p>Our paint designs are very much a work in progress – as the brand evolves and finds its voice. We started out with the loud and bold funky cow fork and stem to make a bit more of a statement and to be easily seen. Now we have put the funky cow design (the yellow cowprint) on the inside of the fork to make it more subtle, but it’s still very much there and part of our design.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/Onguza_SRAM_02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/Onguza_SRAM_02.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/Onguza_SRAM_02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/Onguza_SRAM_02.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Onguza by SRAM</em></p>\n<p><strong>Okay, last but not least: Tell me your favorite African ride snack.</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>“My wife likes to say that Namibia should be used as a research centre for an apocalyptic global warming future. And as usual, she has a good point! Our factory is based on the edge of the desert with bushland savannah and a lot of dust. Absolutely amazing scenery but not always the most forgiving. As such, we don’t get any bananas growing like one would in Rwanda or other places. No fig trees to stop under and fill your belly like in Girona.<br />\nWhen I was still racing, I would have to ride 65 km on the one tar road through town in order to get to the next small town where I could fill up my bottles at the petrol station shop – and Coke was always on the shopping list, no matter what.</p>\n<p>But there is one gravel road loop of 150 km that always had me excited! Especially once I started riding it regularly after I built my first monster cross bike (now known as a gravel bike) in 2016. Besides a few private farm houses and one lodge where a water stop is possible, there is only one village with shops and the chance to buy some refreshments. Sitting outside one of the shops, in the shade of an acacia tree, there is always an old lady with her cast iron pot, preparing fresh <em>vetkoek</em>. <em>Vetkoek</em> translates directly to “Fat Cake” and essentially is an unsweetened donut which is usually eaten with curry mince or other savory combinations. I don’t think there is any other ride food that gets me quite as excited as that little old lady.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\"

SRAM 13-speed gravel groupset. This bike doesn’t even have cable routing for mechanical shifting. This was a huge gamble on my part, and it could come back to bite me in the <i>nalgas</i>. The groupset has performed flawlessly, and there’s no noticeable lag in the shifting, the only caveat is the experience.</p>\n<p>It feels like tapping an iPhone when shifting compared to an actual lever. In my opinion, it makes you feel less connected to the bike and the terrain. Another new sensation for me is low battery anxiety; I question myself almost every single ride if I charged my bike (bear in mind this is also coming from someone experiencing late-diagnosed adulthood ADHD).</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-69.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-69.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-69.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Onguza-Bicycles-Goat-Gravel-Bike-Review-69.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Pricing and Build Kit</h3>\n<p>The full frameset (frame, fork, stem, seat post, and headset – painted and shipped) starts at $4,100 USD, with a $1,500 deposit to begin the process.</p>\n<p>I know this isn’t pennies.
