The only way I have been able to keep the ridiculous factory simulation from eating an even-more-unhealthy amount of my time was the game's keyboard-and-mouse dependency. But the work, it has found me—on my couch, on a trip, wherever one might game, really.</p>\n<p>In a 1.1 release on <em>Satisfactory</em>'s Experimental branch, there are <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/526870/view/520835140699555676\">lots of new things</a>, but the biggest new thing is a controller scheme. Xbox and DualSense are officially supported, though anyone playing on Steam can likely tweak their way to something that works on other pads. With this, the game becomes far more playable for those playing on a couch, on a portable gaming PC like the Steam Deck, or over household or remote streaming. It also paves the way for the game's console release, which is currently slated for sometime in 2025.</p>\n<div><div></div><div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div>\n      Coffee Stain Studios reviews the contents of its Experimental branch 1.1 update.\n\n          </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p><em>Satisfactory</em> seems like an unlikely candidate for controller support, let alone consoles. It's a game where you do a lot of three-dimensional thinking, putting machines and conveyer belts and power lines in just the right places, either because you need to or it just feels proper. How would it feel to select, rotate, place, and connect everything using a controller? Have I just forgotten that <em>Minecraft, </em>and first-person games as a whole, probably seemed similarly desk-bound at one time? I grabbed an Xbox Wireless controller, strapped on my biofuel-powered jetpack, and gave a reduced number of inputs a shot.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/satisfactory-now-has-controller-support-so-theres-no-excuse-for-your-bad-lines/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/satisfactory-now-has-controller-support-so-theres-no-excuse-for-your-bad-lines/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6f72d92b71d32ee25e6e46e495fdb0f6fd2207241905d804a26b47372d104396","category":"Tech"}
