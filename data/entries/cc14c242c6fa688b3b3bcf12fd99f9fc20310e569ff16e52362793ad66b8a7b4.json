The new Jespr cycling computer promises ease of use, easy-to-digest data expression, and immersive mapping, all in a tidy package. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-mounted--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-mounted--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Jespr computer mounted\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-mounted--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-mounted--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-mounted--1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-mounted--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-mounted--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-mounted--2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-mounted--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-mounted--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(All Images: Jespr) </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Jesper Computer Display</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Jasper computer boasts a large, high-resolution display. The clear-eyed (easy-to-read) interface Jespr developed allows riders to quickly consume ride metrics and mapping details at a glance without taking their eyes off the road. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the display, the Jespr computer boasts advanced GPS features, including automatic rerouting, course notifications, climb detection, topographical view, and wind information. Like most computers, riders can add different bikes to their profiles. Choose their ride type, and the device will show relevant information. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-controls--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-controls--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Jespr computer controls\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-controls--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-controls--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-controls--1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-controls--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-controls--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-controls--2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-controls--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-controls--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Estimated Ride Power </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Jespr computer connects to ride sensors, including heart rate and power. But even for cyclists who ride without a power meter, Jespr can derive and estimate live power output values from other available ride data (the accuracy of this remains to be seen). More importantly (to me at least), Jespr can also pair with rear-mounted radar systems and show approaching traffic on the display.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-water-proof-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-water-proof-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Jespr computer water proof\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-water-proof-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-water-proof-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-water-proof-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-water-proof-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-water-proof-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-water-proof-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-water-proof-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-water-proof-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Specific Ride Modes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Because no ride is the same as the last, the Jespr cycling computer includes specific ride modes developed with partnered professional athletes and performance coaches. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ride Modes Include</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Free Ride Mode </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Direction Mode </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Training Mode</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Race Mode</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p> <em>Jespr hasn’t included much information on the breakdown of each mode but we’re guessing it is more or less power and HR metrics on the screen. – More to come as we know! </em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Jespr computer\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer--1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer--2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Internet Connection to Every Ride</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Jespr computer boasts the first integrated ‘always on’ mobile data connection with an internal SIM that eliminates tethering to your phone. Unlike the Hammerhead Karoo 2, where a SIM card is optional, the Jespr has one built directly into the computer. This means ongoing navigation and wind data information come via the device. If you happen to be in an area without Jespr coverage, Jespr says you can connect the device with an active hotspot. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Over the Air Sync</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://my.Jespr.io\">my.Jespr.io </a>platform supports the sync of over-the-air routes and training plans with all major players, including Strava, Training Peaks, and Komoot. Settings are also synced to the Jespr platform – a stellar feature if a user switches to a new Jespr device. Plus, software updates beam to the device automatically, without the hassles typical of other devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-mount-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-mount-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Jespr computer mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-mount-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-mount-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-mount-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-mount-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-mount-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-mount-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-mount-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computer-mount-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>A Free Data Subscription (till 2025) for the First Users</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a welcome to the Jespr eco-system, the brand’s first customers will receive a free data plan until the end of 2025. After that, a monthly subscription model kicks in, estimated at $5.50/€5.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computerJespr-computer-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computerJespr-computer-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Jespr computerJespr computer\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computerJespr-computer-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computerJespr-computer-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computerJespr-computer-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computerJespr-computer-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computerJespr-computer-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computerJespr-computer-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computerJespr-computer-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jespr-computerJespr-computer-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Jespr Computer Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Weight 180 g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Colors: black</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Touch screen and tactile buttons</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cellular, WiFi, ANT+, Bluetooth</li>\n\n\n\n<li>24 months warranty</li>\n\n\n\n<li>CE certified</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Made in Switzerland</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pricing and Availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Available in Europe now – North America soon</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pricing: $612, €570 including VAT (Europe), CHF 540 including VAT (Switzerland)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jespr.io/home\">Jespr.io/home</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/swiss-startup-jespr-debutes-e570-cycling-computer/\">The Swiss-Made Jespr Cycling Computer Is Essentially a Cell Phone for Your Bike</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"cc14c242c6fa688b3b3bcf12fd99f9fc20310e569ff16e52362793ad66b8a7b4","category":"Cycling"}
