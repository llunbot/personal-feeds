Right now, the states with the highest averages for daily new cases per 100,000 people are Arkansas, Missouri, Florida, Louisiana, and Nevada, which all have below-average vaccination rates. Nationwide, average daily cases are up 140 percent over the past two weeks. Hospitalizations and deaths, which lag behind increases in cases by weeks, are also up 34 percent and 33 percent, respectively.</p>\n<p>Relative to the rest of the pandemic, the nationwide numbers of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are low—they're matching or are below numbers seen back in April of 2020.
