{"title":"Apple Updates iPad Air (M2→M3) and Regular iPad (A14→A16), and Revamps Magic Keyboard for iPad Air","link":"https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/03/apple-updates-ipad-air-and-ipad-revamps-magic-keyboard-for-ipad-air/","date":1741122113000,"content":"\n<p>Dan Moren, writing at Six Colors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The most consequential part of the Air’s update — perhaps the\n<em>only</em> real update — is the M3 processor, which brings with it\nGPU-based capabilities like hardware-accelerated ray tracing and\nvideo encoding and decoding for ProRes and ProRes RAW.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, the Air is basically unchanged: it comes in 11-inch and\n13-inch versions, features the same cameras, battery life, the\nexact same dimensions, and the same accessory compatibility as its\nM2-based predecessor. It even comes in the same colors — Space\nGray, Blue, Purple, and Starlight — at the same prices starting\nat $599.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A true speed-bump update — no big whoop, but it’s good for the platform for devices to get regular speed-bump updates in between major new revisions. The previous M2 iPad Air models only came out in May of last year, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/05/brief_thoughts_and_observations_on_yesterdays_let_loose_ipad_keynote\">alongside the M4 iPad Pro models</a>. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/06/ipad-air-m2-9-core-gpu\">Just like those M2 iPad Air models</a>, these new M3 iPad Airs have 9-core GPUs. The current (not for long?) M3 MacBook Airs are offered with 8- and 10-core GPUs. I presume these 9-core M3 chips used for the iPad Air are <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/glossary-binning-definition,5892.html\">binned chips</a> that didn’t have 10 good GPU cores?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The new Magic Keyboard for Air is interesting in that it seems to\nmeld parts of the older Magic Keyboard with the Magic Keyboard for\niPad Pro <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/05/some-hands-on-ipad-event-impressions/\">last May</a>. While the new Magic Keyboard includes a\nfunction row and a larger trackpad like its Pro compatriot, it\nlacks haptics in the trackpad and backlit keys, and it seems to be\nbuilt on the same design of the original silicone exterior instead\nof the new aluminum-based model. But you get some cost savings for\nthat: it’s just $269 instead of $299. Also, it only comes in white — black keyboards are for pros, I guess.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>$269 feels like a crummy deal. The new-from-last-year $299 Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro, with an aluminum top, feels way more than $30 better than the old-style silicone-covered ones like this new Magic Keyboard for iPad Air. It kind of feels like a design failure of some sort that these new iPad Airs can’t use the same Magic Keyboards as the iPad Pros of the same size.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The base iPad’s update is perhaps somewhat more disappointing, as\nthat model was introduced in 2022 and its A16 processor will make\nit one of the few current main-line Apple devices — perhaps only — not to support Apple Intelligence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The recently updated iPad Mini (<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/apple-introduces-powerful-new-ipad-mini-built-for-apple-intelligence/\">October</a>) has an A17 Pro chip, and thus supports Apple Intelligence. But the iPad Mini starts at $500, and the regular iPad still starts at just $350. The just-plain iPad is really the only “budget” device that Apple makes. There are no iPhone or Mac models in that price range.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/moren-ipad-air-ipad-updates\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"02d820edc216903f105ba0e9abe984ed3aec4805bef678ba5133a81bd265b832","category":"Tech"}
