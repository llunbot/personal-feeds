Motivated by the adoption of Wi-Fi 6E in these two Apple devices, competitors will be encouraged to do the same.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOther upcoming head-mounted displays for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) experiences, such as from Meta, will also offer Wi-Fi 6E. Kuo explained that Wi-Fi 6E will be key to providing the high-speed wireless transmissions necessary for AR and VR experiences.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nKuo said that head-mounted display devices in 2022, 2023, and 2024 will offer Wi-Fi 6/6E, Wi-Fi 6E/7, and Wi-Fi 7, respectively, but it is unclear if this information is related to Apple's product roadmap specifically.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nKuo had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/01/apple-ar-vr-headset-wifi-6e-support/\">previously mentioned</a> that Apple's headset is expected to feature Wi-Fi 6E but this is the first explicit mention of the upgraded specification for the ‌iPhone 14‌. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/18/iphone-13-may-support-wifi-6e-barclays/\">Some</a> reports <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/26/iphone-13-wi-fi-6e-rumor/\">suggested</a> that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> lineup would feature Wi-Fi 6E, but the rumor never panned out.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWi-Fi 6E offers the features and capabilities of Wi-Fi 6, including higher performance, lower latency, and faster data rates, extended into the 6 GHz band. The additional spectrum provides more airspace beyond existing 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi, resulting in increased bandwidth and less interference.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLast year, the <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-opens-6-ghz-band-wi-fi-and-other-unlicensed-uses\">FCC adopted rules</a> that make 1,200 MHz of spectrum in the 6 GHz band available for unlicensed use in the United States, paving the way for the introduction of new devices with Wi-Fi 6E support.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/\">Apple Glasses</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wifi-6e/\">WiFi 6E</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-glasses-ar-and-vr.209\">Apple Glasses, AR and VR</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/17/iphone-14-and-mixed-reality-headset-wi-fi-6e/\">Kuo: iPhone 14 and Mixed Reality Headset to Feature Wi-Fi 6E</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-iphone-14-and-mixed-reality-headset-to-feature-wi-fi-6e.2323788/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=FUxf5lrOZCY:RjZz0W4YEoY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=FUxf5lrOZCY:RjZz0W4YEoY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1d843b89c4d43cafc6a9d079ba478a71fc50b5fa8817ba1868eff81acddb9e3c","category":"Apple"}
