In fact, judging by the plummeting temperatures recently you’d be forgiven for thinking autumn had been and gone too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Except it hasn’t, and we know that because we haven’t had Il Lombardia yet. The fifth and final Monument of the year is an autumnal institution – not for nothing is it known as ‘The Race of the Falling Leaves’ – and is typically the last big appointment of the year for the pro peloton’s leading lights.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride 157 Lake Como\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-02.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Its status isn’t done any harm, of course, by where it takes place. Starting in Bergamo and winding its way through Lombardy in the direction of Como, it’s a day-long advertisement for the picture postcard splendour of this part of the world – even (or especially) when dressed in fallen leaves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also the location for our Big Ride in the November 2024 issue of <em>Cyclist</em> magazine, which is available on newsstands now. Our route takes in the majestic grandeur of Lake Como, tackles the infamous Muro di Sormano and Madonna del Ghisallo climbs, and even works in a couple of boat crossings on the lake itself. You won’t find the pros doing that next Saturday.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/classic-climb-galibier-01-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Classic Climb Col du Galibier\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/classic-climb-galibier-01-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/classic-climb-galibier-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/classic-climb-galibier-01-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/classic-climb-galibier-01-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/classic-climb-galibier-01-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/classic-climb-galibier-01-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/classic-climb-galibier-01-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/classic-climb-galibier-01-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/classic-climb-galibier-01.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In contrast to the short, sharp brutality of Il Lombardia’s signature climbs we have the far more grandiose Col du Galibier, which is the subject of this issue’s Classic Climb. As a Tour de France institution it’s a climb that needs little introduction, whether tackling it from the north via the Col de Telegraphe or – as we do here – from the south via the Col de Lauterets.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/new-issue-vuelta-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/new-issue-vuelta-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/new-issue-vuelta-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/new-issue-vuelta-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/new-issue-vuelta-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/new-issue-vuelta-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/new-issue-vuelta-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/new-issue-vuelta-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/new-issue-vuelta-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/new-issue-vuelta.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Also in the November issue, we look back at the recent Vuelta a España through the eyes of a pro photographer, delve into the science around training at altitude, visit the headquarters of British titanium bike brand Mason, and test new bikes from Enve, Enigma and Van Rysel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.cyclist.co.uk/collections/coffee/products/issue-157\" target=\"_blank\">Get your issue at the Cyclist Shop</a> or <a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">get a Cyclist magazine subscription</a> to have every issue delivered free, straight to your door.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/clickable-subs-promo9-970x343.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/clickable-subs-promo9-970x343.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/clickable-subs-promo9-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/clickable-subs-promo9-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/clickable-subs-promo9-1536x543.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/clickable-subs-promo9-2048x724.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/clickable-subs-promo9-750x265.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/clickable-subs-promo9-1140x403.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There are three levels of <em>Cyclist </em>subscriptions available.
