On Friday, security tester Jax Winterbourne <a href=\"https://x.com/JaxWinterbourne/status/1733339886155968714?s=20\">tweeted</a> a screenshot of Grok denying a query with the statement, \"I'm afraid I cannot fulfill that request, as it goes against OpenAI's use case policy.\" That made ears perk up online, since Grok isn't made by OpenAI—the company responsible for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/\">ChatGPT</a>, which Grok is positioned to compete with.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, xAI representatives did not deny that this behavior occurs with its AI model. In reply, xAI employee Igor Babuschkin <a href=\"https://x.com/ibab_ml/status/1733558576982155274?s=20\">wrote</a>, \"The issue here is that the web is full of ChatGPT outputs, so we accidentally picked up some of them when we trained Grok on a large amount of web data. This was a huge surprise to us when we first noticed it. For what it’s worth, the issue is very rare and now that we’re aware of it we’ll make sure that future versions of Grok don’t have this problem. Don’t worry, no OpenAI code was used to make Grok.\"</p>\n<p>In reply to Babuschkin, Winterbourne wrote, \"Thanks for the response. I will say it's not very rare, and occurs quite frequently when involving code creation. Nonetheless, I'll let people who specialize in LLM and AI weigh in on this further. I'm merely an observer.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989950#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989950&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1f88e9f318a3e177a552b77fa41b46948730573aa7c7429cf2e649217cf9c987","category":"Tech"}
