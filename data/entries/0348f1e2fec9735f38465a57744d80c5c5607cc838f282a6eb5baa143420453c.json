The smaller iPhone 16 Pro, as well as the lower-end iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, are largely still available for launch-day delivery on Friday, September 20 as of writing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInventory will inevitably continue to tighten for both delivery and Apple Store pickup as the day progresses, so order quickly if you are planning to.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone 16 Pro models have several new features, including larger 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays with thinner bezels, longer battery life, a new Camera Control button for quick access to camera functions, a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera, a faster A18 Pro chip, Wi-Fi 7 support, faster 5G, faster charging, and more. Both of the devices support Apple Intelligence, which will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/ios-18-1-available-in-october/\">begin rolling out with iOS 18.1 in October</a>.
