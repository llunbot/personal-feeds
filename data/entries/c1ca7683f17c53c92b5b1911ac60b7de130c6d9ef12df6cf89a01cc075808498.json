For example, both Macs support up to eight 4K displays at 60Hz when configured with the M2 Ultra chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Pro-Display-XDR-Lifestyle.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThe new Mac Studio has an HDMI 2.1 port, and the new Mac Pro has two. These ports each support an 8K display at 60Hz, or a 4K display at 240Hz. Apple says the M2 Ultra chip also supports up to six Pro Display XDRs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe previous Mac Studio supported up to five external displays when configured with the M1 Ultra chip, so the new model supporting up to eight is a considerable improvement. Apple silicon has come a long way in this area since the first Macs with the M1 chip were released in 2020 with native support for only a single external display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new Mac Studio and Mac Pro launched today after pre-orders began last week. Apple has also published support documents explaining <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213663\">how to install PCIe cards in the Mac Pro</a> and listing <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213661\">compatible types of PCIe cards</a>. Unlike the Intel-based Mac Pro, the new model <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/11/apple-exec-discusses-mac-pro-lack-of-egpu-support/\">does not support graphics cards</a> due to Apple silicon's unified architecture.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio\">Mac Studio (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro\">Mac Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237\">Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-pro.1\">Mac Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/13/m2-ultra-chip-supports-up-to-eight-4k-displays/\">New Mac Studio and Mac Pro Support Up to Eight 4K Displays</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-mac-studio-and-mac-pro-support-up-to-eight-4k-displays.2392894/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c1ca7683f17c53c92b5b1911ac60b7de130c6d9ef12df6cf89a01cc075808498","category":"Apple"}
