The \"Charged\" ad, for example, shows a serious professor commenting on a student's remaining battery life.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\"First class of the day and no charger? You're playing a dangerous game...\" he says, but the student says that she doesn't have to worry about it because the Mac's battery lasts all day.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn \"Powered,\" a student in a library is approached by a woman who says that laptops aren't meant to handle big files and multiple apps. \"You think it won't crash?\" she says. \"You're a hot dog in a hurricane.\" The student lets her know that \"it's a Mac,\" so it's \"running fine.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nThe \"Found\" ad features a student looking for her laptop. \"Yeah, computers have a funny way of vanishing around here...\" says a man nearby. The student uses ‌Find My‌ to ping her laptop and is able to locate it while he's still going on about how computers are often sold for parts. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nAll three videos have a dramatic, funny vibe that should play well on social networks. The ads are 38 seconds long, so they'll likely be shown on TikTok, Instagram, and other social networks.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/\">Apple Ads</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/mac-ads-apple-silicon-battery-life/\">Humorous Apple Ads Highlight MacBook's Power and Battery Life</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/humorous-apple-ads-highlight-macbooks-power-and-battery-life.2428045/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6456b7c07b562bed8eab0eef679216633e2edf6c0cdb915545ce96bf077aa58e","category":"Apple"}
