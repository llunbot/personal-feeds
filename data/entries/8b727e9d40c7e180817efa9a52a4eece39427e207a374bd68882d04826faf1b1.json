{"title":"OpenAI Might Be Making a Web Browser","link":"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-considers-taking-on-google-with-browser","date":1732645855000,"content":"\n<p>Erin Woo, Sahil Patel, and Amir Efrati, reporting for The Information (paywalled, alas):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>OpenAI is preparing to launch a frontal assault on Google. The\nChatGPT owner recently considered developing a web browser that it\nwould combine with its chatbot, and it has separately discussed or\nstruck deals to power search features for travel, food, real\nestate and retail websites, according to people who have seen\nprototypes or designs of the products. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Making a web browser could help OpenAI have more control over a\nprimary gateway through which people use the web, as well as\nfurther boost ChatGPT, which has more than 300 million weekly\nusers just two years after its launch. It isn’t clear how a\nChatGPT browser’s features would differ from those of other\nbrowsers.</p>\n\n<p>In a signal of its interest in a browser, several months ago\nOpenAI hired Ben Goodger, a founding member of the Chrome team at\nGoogle. Another recent hire is Darin Fisher, who worked with\nGoodger to develop Chrome.</p>\n\n<p>But OpenAI isn’t remotely close to launching a browser, multiple\npeople said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bengoodger_excited-to-share-that-ive-joined-the-supremely-activity-7206837692494483456-dMzn/\">Goodger</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/darin-fisher-7059ab/\">Fisher</a>’s hirings weren’t secret — both keep up-to-date profiles on LinkedIn — and it’s not safe to assume that just because two people have previously created new web browsers that their new gig is creating a new web browser. But it sure feels like a good guess.</p>\n\n<p>Fisher most recently was at <a href=\"https://thebrowser.company/\">The Browser Company</a> for two years, working on <a href=\"https://arc.net/\">Arc</a>, an innovative browser that I admire for its originality but which simply did not click for me at all. The Browser Company is in flux, too, working both on Arc 2.0 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24279020/browser-company-ai-browser-arc\">and an as-yet-unnamed second project</a> that might be a more traditional web browser.</p>\n\n<p>Combine this with regulatory pressure on Apple’s Safari and especially Google’s Chrome, and it’s an exciting time for web browsers. It’s kind of wild how every few years the web browser market gets shaken up. The pattern that’s repeated several times is that just when the browser market seems settled — like the markets for, say, spreadsheets and word processors — there’s a period of flux and new entries shake up the market. There was a point where it seemed like Internet Explorer would be dominant forever; today it doesn’t even exist. There was a point where Firefox seemed entrenched on Windows; <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/all/worldwide/2023\">today it’s an afterthought</a>. Today <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/all/worldwide/2023\">Chrome seems entrenched, as dominant as IE once was</a>. Maybe not?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/26/openai-browser\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8b727e9d40c7e180817efa9a52a4eece39427e207a374bd68882d04826faf1b1","category":"Tech"}
