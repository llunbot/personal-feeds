I don’t believe we’ve ever covered Girona-based Mégamo bikes before. Although I’ve occasionally seen them around the European XC Marathon circuit over the last few years. This latest Track XC bike even popped up in the PR of Fulcrum’s latest <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fulcrum-red-zone-carbon-plus-lightweight-xc-mtb-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">Red Zone Carbon+</a> cross-country racing wheels last fall. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the Buff-Megamo men have ridden to a first-stage Cape Epic win on this limited edition bike you can actually buy now through their dealers… if one is close to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What kind of bike is the Megamo Track R120?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Megamo Track is a modern 120mm full carbon full-suspension XC race bike, paired to 120mm forks. It features a familiar lightweight linkage-driven single-pivot suspension design with small-diameter flex seatstays. Its short control link is mounted high on the seattube, driving a horizontal shock under the thin, wide toptube. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Track is built around modern geometry for technical XCO &amp; XCM racing – in 4 stock sizes (S-XL). Slack 66.5° head angle, steep 75.6° seat angle, short 431mm chainstays. And medium long Reach (435mm in M, 460mm in L).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Megamo-Track-120mm-carbon-XC-Marathon-mountain-bike_Buff-Megamo-Team-Cape-Epic-Limited-Edition-replica_angled-rear.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Megamo-Track-120mm-carbon-XC-Marathon-mountain-bike_Buff-Megamo-Team-Cape-Epic-Limited-Edition-replica_angled-rear.jpg\" alt=\"Megamo Track 120mm carbon XC Marathon mountain bike, Buff-Megamo Team Cape Epic Limited Edition replica, angled rear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Megamo-Track-120mm-carbon-XC-Marathon-mountain-bike_Buff-Megamo-Team-Cape-Epic-Limited-Edition-replica_angled-rear.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Megamo-Track-120mm-carbon-XC-Marathon-mountain-bike_Buff-Megamo-Team-Cape-Epic-Limited-Edition-replica_angled-rear-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Megamo-Track-120mm-carbon-XC-Marathon-mountain-bike_Buff-Megamo-Team-Cape-Epic-Limited-Edition-replica_angled-rear-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Megamo-Track-120mm-carbon-XC-Marathon-mountain-bike_Buff-Megamo-Team-Cape-Epic-Limited-Edition-replica_angled-rear-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Megamo-Track-120mm-carbon-XC-Marathon-mountain-bike_Buff-Megamo-Team-Cape-Epic-Limited-Edition-replica_angled-rear-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Megamo-Track-120mm-carbon-XC-Marathon-mountain-bike_Buff-Megamo-Team-Cape-Epic-Limited-Edition-replica_angled-rear-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Megamo-Track-120mm-carbon-XC-Marathon-mountain-bike_Buff-Megamo-Team-Cape-Epic-Limited-Edition-replica_angled-rear-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Megamo &amp; <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/buffmegamoteam/\" target=\"_blank\">Buff-Megamo</a>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Add on top of that most of the current top-tier standards.

But this is still a great-looking limited edition bike worth a closer look. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Megamo-Track-120mm-carbon-XC-Marathon-mountain-bike_Buff-Megamo-Team-Cape-Epic-Limited-Edition-replica_20-bikes.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Megamo-Track-120mm-carbon-XC-Marathon-mountain-bike_Buff-Megamo-Team-Cape-Epic-Limited-Edition-replica_20-bikes.jpg\" alt=\"Megamo Track 120mm carbon XC Marathon mountain bike, Buff-Megamo Team Cape Epic Limited Edition replica, 1/20 LTD\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Megamo-Track-120mm-carbon-XC-Marathon-mountain-bike_Buff-Megamo-Team-Cape-Epic-Limited-Edition-replica_20-bikes.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Megamo-Track-120mm-carbon-XC-Marathon-mountain-bike_Buff-Megamo-Team-Cape-Epic-Limited-Edition-replica_20-bikes-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Megamo-Track-120mm-carbon-XC-Marathon-mountain-bike_Buff-Megamo-Team-Cape-Epic-Limited-Edition-replica_20-bikes-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Megamo-Track-120mm-carbon-XC-Marathon-mountain-bike_Buff-Megamo-Team-Cape-Epic-Limited-Edition-replica_20-bikes-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Megamo-Track-120mm-carbon-XC-Marathon-mountain-bike_Buff-Megamo-Team-Cape-Epic-Limited-Edition-replica_20-bikes-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Megamo-Track-120mm-carbon-XC-Marathon-mountain-bike_Buff-Megamo-Team-Cape-Epic-Limited-Edition-replica_20-bikes-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Megamo-Track-120mm-carbon-XC-Marathon-mountain-bike_Buff-Megamo-Team-Cape-Epic-Limited-Edition-replica_20-bikes-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Only 20 Buff-Megamo Team Cape Epic Limited Edition Megamo Track XC bikes are officially for sale anyway.
