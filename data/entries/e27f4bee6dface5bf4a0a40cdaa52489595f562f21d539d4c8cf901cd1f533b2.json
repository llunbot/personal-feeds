We call it Apple Breakfast because we think it goes great with a Monday morning cup of coffee or tea, but it’s cool if you want to give it a read during lunch or dinner hours too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is this event another non-event?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple started running virtual press events during the pandemic when in-person gatherings made little sense and at various times were frowned upon or literally illegal. But Apple has largely stuck with that format even as health concerns lessened and its own employees were herded back into the office. Why is that? Because virtual events have advantages far beyond the containment of disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from avoiding the logistical headaches of getting a thousand bad-tempered journalists from around the world to the same place at the same time, a pre-recorded video presentation is much easier to run smoothly than a live performance. Remember when Craig Federighi introduced Face ID and the phone refused to unlock? Or when Steve Jobs’ clicker didn’t work? We’d never have seen those or any number of other gaffes if Apple had the ability to do another take or recreate the process with CGI. Pre-recorded keynotes are not immune to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2062534/apple-environment-mother-nature-skit-usb-c.html\">embarrassing errors of judgment</a>, but they happen a lot less.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody cringes harder than me when live performers get things wrong, and I absolutely get the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676617/why-all-apple-announcements-should-be-virtual.html\">attraction of virtual keynotes</a> for Apple. But it does raise some awkward existential questions about why we need to bother with the elaborate charade that is a keynote presentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What, after all, is the point of a keynote? If it’s just to get information about new products, that can be done far more efficiently via a press release that you can read at your own speed; just the facts, no sitting through skits and corporate self-congratulation. Is it to be marketed by the best hypemen in the business? If that’s really something you want, you might as well get it from an ad: virtual keynotes give none of that dubious excitement and tribalistic sense of inclusivity you get with a live performance. And we’ve even lost the stress-test element of seeing an executive operating the product under extreme pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we’re left with is a strange hybrid: a long press release read out by a series of charisma-free executives, interspersed with advertisements. Which is fine, provided the information is at least worth the effort. But as far as tomorrow’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2320316/let-loose-may-7-different-kind-of-apple-event-speculation.html\">Let Loose</a> event goes, the signs are not promising. It looks a lot like Apple wanted to use its spring 2024 event to launch both iPads and MacBooks but had to hold back the iPads as a result of production delays, and during the wait, the MacBooks were released via a quiet press release. Has anything new appeared in the meantime to fill the stage/screen time that would have been devoted to laptops? Perhaps. And perhaps not, in which case we’ll be getting an awful lot of filler about environmental policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s possible that Apple will come up with a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2311282/3-surprises-apple-let-loose-event.html\">surprise announcement</a> Tuesday to blow our socks off: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2002360/apple-needs-to-totally-rethink-airpods-max.html\">2nd-gen AirPods Max</a>, a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePod with a screen</a>, or a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-ai-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">revamped version of Siri</a> that’s actually smart. Even a new standard iPad or iPad mini would be somewhat interesting. But it seems likely we’ll just get a new iPad Air (including a new larger-screen model), a new iPad Pro (with a fancy OLED screen and either an M3 or M4 processor), a new overpriced Magic Keyboard, and yet another Apple Pencil with a squeeze gesture. And a lot of viewers will wish Apple had saved us all the bother and sent out an email.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3811721/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trending: Top stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wait, is Apple actually <strong>doomed</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2318517/macalope-apple-doomed-iphone-vision-pro-sales.html\">for real this time</a>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s <strong>M3 chip</strong> is a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2318469/apple-m3-chip-victim-of-the-times.html\">victim of the times</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>new iPad Pro</strong> is coming to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2319895/ipad-pro-let-loose-event-oled-display-processor-accessories.html\">take the tablet crown</a> (and your money).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google finally <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2322890/google-android-audio-emoji-joy-clapping-poop-sounds.html\">made an Android feature</a> even <strong>Apple won’t steal</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2319323/makes-no-sense-give-ipad-m4-before-mac.html\">makes no sense</a> to give the iPad Pro an <strong>M4 chip</strong> before the Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, to take the <strong>opposite viewpoint</strong>… putting an M4 in an iPad Pro <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2320631/ipad-pro-m4-processor-ai-hardware-developers-timing.html\">makes perfect sense</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2322093/apple-q2-2024-earnings.html\">Apple Q2 2024 earnings:</a> Analysts’ expectations exceeded but <strong>iPhone sales down</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Podcast of the week</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, Apple is holding an event dubbed <strong>“Let Loose.”</strong> So what new products will Apple introduce on May 7?
