That’s despite the fact that the brand uses many of the same high-quality materials as their much more expensive competitors. Furthering their value proposition, Tifosi offers a lifetime warranty against manufacturing defects, and makes replacement parts available so you can potentially extend the life of your shades, even if you are rough on them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tifosi Optics Rivet: $79.95</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-studio.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-studio-800x534.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-studio-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-studio-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-studio-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-studio-768x513.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-studio-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-studio.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Tifosi Rivet is a lightweight, half-frame sunglass designed to offer adequate coverage with a sleek look. The lenses are made from shatterproof and scratch-resistant polycarbonate, and they offer 100% UVA/UVB protection. The lenses have their own vents to prevent condensation, and they’re ideal for medium to large faces, with each measuring 42.1mm x 71.5mm. The Rivet’s frames are 137mm wide overall,  arms are 120mm long, and the bridge measures 15mm.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With an ultralight and durable Grilamid TR-90 frame the Rivets weigh just 28g. Their adjustable nose and ear pads are made from hydrophilic rubber so they actually get grippier as you sweat.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-black-blue.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"355\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-black-blue-800x355.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-black-blue-800x355.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-black-blue-297x132.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-black-blue-120x53.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-black-blue-768x341.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-black-blue.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rivet offers five different lens/frame combinations – one suggested option for cyclists is this Satin Vapor frame with a Clarion Blue Fototec photochromic lens. This lens ranges from nearly clear to a smoke tint with blue mirror when exposed to sunlight, which Tifosi says is ideal for riding in varying light conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-straight-on.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-straight-on-800x350.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-straight-on-800x350.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-straight-on-297x130.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-straight-on-120x53.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-straight-on-768x336.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rivet-straight-on.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Between the six available frame colors, other lens options include Clarion lenses (<em>which repel moisture</em>), Enliven Golf lenses (<em>specifically tuned for green contrast on golf courses</em>), and Tifosi’s Interchange models come with three different lenses to cover bright, low light, and no light situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rivet’s MSRP remains the same for all different lens/frame options – which seems like an especially good value on the photochromic lenses. Each pair comes with a zippered hardshell case and a microfiber cleaning bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tifosi Optics Rail Race: $79.95</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-red-angle.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-red-angle-800x450.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-red-angle-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-red-angle-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-red-angle-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-red-angle-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-red-angle-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-red-angle.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In October of 2022, the frame-less <strong><a href=\"https://tifosioptics.com/products/rail-race?al_pg_id=ad00d061-fe51-4f90-b36a-ca4cc84450f2\">Rail Race</a></strong> was launched as a limited edition model – an update to the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/tifosi-rail-xc-sunglasses-first-look/\" target=\"_blank\">Rail XC</a> that we just reviewed this spring. But after selling out quickly, now it is now being re-released as a regular part of Tifosi’s lineup. The re-released models now feature top and bottom vents, and laser etching on their rimless frames.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-white-blue-angle.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-white-blue-angle-800x450.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-white-blue-angle-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-white-blue-angle-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-white-blue-angle-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-white-blue-angle-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-white-blue-angle-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-white-blue-angle.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rail Race’s temples/arms are also made from light &amp; durable Grilamid TR-90, and the sunglasses claim a weight of 32g. Like the Rivets above, they include shatterproof, scratch-resistant polycarbonate lenses that provide 100% UVA/UVB protection, just here with extra coverage. The Rail Race also shares Tifosi’s adjustable hydrophilic rubber ear and nose pieces.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-straight-on.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-straight-on-800x450.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-straight-on-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-straight-on-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-straight-on-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-straight-on-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-straight-on-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tifosi-Rail-Race-straight-on.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideal for larger faces, the Rail Race measures 131mm wide, the arms 121mm long, and the nose bridge is 15.5mm wide. For ample eye protection, the lenses are on the taller side at 59.5mm, measured top-to-bottom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rail Race sunglasses also come in three frame colors, and each includes two interchangeable lenses – one clear and one shaded (all selling for the same price). Available combinations are Satin Vapor frames with Clarion Red/Clear lenses, Crystal Clear frames with Clarion Rose/Clear, Matte White with Clarion Blue/Clear, and a special anniversary edition Chrome frame with Clarion Blue/Clear. A hardshell case and microfiber cleaning bag are included with each pair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://tifosioptics.com/?al_pg_id=ad00d061-fe51-4f90-b36a-ca4cc84450f2\">TifosiOptics.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/tifosi-optics-adds-new-affordable-rivet-plus-popular-rail-race-sunglasses-return/\">Tifosi Optics Adds New Affordable Rivet, plus Popular Rail Race Sunglasses Return</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"935ba8599a8e99c650b112776f6536860a641ec757338d8cd8fe051bd4cd73d3","category":"Cycling"}
