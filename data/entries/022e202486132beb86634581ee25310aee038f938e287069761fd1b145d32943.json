Two physicists have now analyzed the underlying fluid dynamics at work to create those intricate shapes and patterns, describing their findings in a <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/2/pgae059/7603780\">new paper</a> published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Nexus.</p>\n<p>“Painters have often employed fluid mechanics to craft unique compositions,\" <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1035730\">said co-author Eliot Fried</a> of the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) in Japan. \"We have seen it with [Mexican muralist] David Alfaro Siqueiros, Jackson Pollock, and Naoko Tosa, just to name a few. In our laboratory, we reproduce and study artistic techniques, to understand how the characteristics of the fluids influence the final outcome.\"</p>\n<p>Fried is one of several scientists intrigued by how artists exploit fluid dynamics in their work. For instance, Roberto Zenit, a physicist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, has been <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/12/study-modern-masters-like-jackson-pollock-were-intuitive-physicists/\">studying the physics</a> of fluids at work in those techniques for several years, concluding that the artists were \"intuitive physicists,\" using science to create timeless art—including <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0126135\">Siqueiros' \"accidental painting\" technique</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007448#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007448&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"022e202486132beb86634581ee25310aee038f938e287069761fd1b145d32943","category":"Tech"}
