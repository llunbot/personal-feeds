However, there is a second one being produced (in a different size) so more We Are One employees can get in on product testing. And that right there is the reason this bike exists. We Are One figured out it would be easier and cheaper to make their own DH frame rather than buy a fleet of someone else’s for product testing purposes. They intend to develop more downhill parts in the future including two that are already on the prototype bike… more on that below!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-linkage.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-linkage.jpg\" alt=\"We Are One prototype downhill bike swingers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-linkage.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-linkage-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-linkage-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-linkage-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-linkage-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-linkage-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One way they kept the prototype’s cost down is by using the same rear triangle found on their Arrival trail/enduro bikes. This wasn’t just about saving money though, using a rear end that is familiar to the staff and test riders helps them focus on other adjustments they make to the prototype. That said, because they’re using stiffer suspension links Design Engineer Vladimir Yordanov notes that this rear end does feel a little stiffer than the Arrival’s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-01-link.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-01-link.jpg\" alt=\"We Are One prototype downhill bike links\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-01-link.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-01-link-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-01-link-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-01-link-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-01-link-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-01-link-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above photo you’ll notice a small ‘01’ on the shock mount. We Are One has four different sets of mounts they can play with, furthermore, they worked with SRAM to get four custom-tuned rear shocks to line up with their sets of mounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike was thoughtfully appointed with different shock mounts, links, and a geo flip-chip so every possible adjustment can be isolated; if they want to alter the shock rate without affecting geometry, that’s an option. If they want to play with geo but maintain the shock tune, they can do that too. Yordanov firmly believes this is the ideal way to nail down all the various attributes of the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-shock-area.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-shock-area-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"We Are One prototype downhill bike rear shock\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-shock-area-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-shock-area-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-shock-area-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-shock-area-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-shock-area-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-shock-area.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since nothing is set in stone, and the bike may not ever be available to the public, I didn’t nag Yordanov for all the various geometry figures they’re testing… mixing up the mounts and shocks will yield a wide range of results, and that’s the whole idea of this test mule. I can tell you the bike is currently running 215mm of rear travel (which could change) and the reach is 480mm, which happens to fit a handful of We Are One’s staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-carbon-DH-handlebar.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"722\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-carbon-DH-handlebar.jpg\" alt=\"We Are One prototype downhill bike head tube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-carbon-DH-handlebar.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-carbon-DH-handlebar-297x179.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-carbon-DH-handlebar-800x481.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-carbon-DH-handlebar-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-carbon-DH-handlebar-768x462.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This bike was built to test downhill components, beginning with We Are One’s carbon downhill rims. But the prototype now has two incoming parts on it; the stem and handlebars. All I can tell you about the bars is that they are carbon fiber, no geometry has been decided at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-DH-stem.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-DH-stem.jpg\" alt=\"We Are One prototype downhill bike handlebar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-DH-stem.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-DH-stem-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-DH-stem-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-DH-stem-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-DH-stem-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-DH-stem-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One cool thing about the prototype stem is that the clamps can be run as shown, or reversed. Flipping them around offers a wider clamp, which should increase or decrease the stiffness of the handlebar. This will likely be quite useful as We Are One tests and hones in their new carbon bars. The prototype stems have been produced in 46mm and 50mm lengths.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-DH-bike-angle.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-DH-bike-angle.jpg\" alt=\"We Are One prototype downhill bike front end\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-DH-bike-angle.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-DH-bike-angle-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-DH-bike-angle-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-DH-bike-angle-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-DH-bike-angle-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WeAreOne-prototype-DH-bike-angle-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While We Are One currently states no intention to produce this prototype DH bike, it’s obvious they have everything they need to do so – but no promises were made! For now, the carbon handlebars and stem are coming soon, so keep an eye on We Are One’s website for those components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.weareonecomposites.com/\">weareonecomposites.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/crankworx-whistler-2023-we-are-one-prototype-dh-testing-mule/\">Crankworx Whistler 2023: We Are One’s Prototype DH Testing Mule</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"c621a72b7712c5185e2bc221504f91c026c31c800d7a5745ea313e2080f2f6ec","category":"Cycling"}
