She shares her startup story, telling the unlikely series of events that led to launching, building, and ultimately selling a sports nutrition brand.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jess-cera-joje-bar-founder-interview-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jess-cera-joje-bar-founder-interview-2-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"jess cera JoJe bar founder with her bike on the coast\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jess-cera-joje-bar-founder-interview-2-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jess-cera-joje-bar-founder-interview-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jess-cera-joje-bar-founder-interview-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jess-cera-joje-bar-founder-interview-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jess-cera-joje-bar-founder-interview-2-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jess-cera-joje-bar-founder-interview-2-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jess-cera-joje-bar-founder-interview-2.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We also talk a little about how her upbringing and support throughout her racing career came full circle to putting on her own event that helps fund scholarships for other girls in her community. It’s a fun story that, as a fellow entrepreneur, I love sharing to inspire you to follow your own dreams and see where they take you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>This Episode Sponsored by:</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/970-x-250.jpg\" alt=\"Hammerhead Karoo 2 cycling computer ad\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/970-x-250.jpg 970w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/970-x-250-297x77.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/970-x-250-800x206.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/970-x-250-120x31.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/970-x-250-768x198.jpg 768w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hammerhead Karoo 2 is the most advanced GPS cycling computer available today, with industry-leading mapping, navigation, and routing capabilities that set it apart from other GPS options.
