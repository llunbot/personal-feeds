{"title":"DJI Mavic 4 Pro vs The Gauntlet: ActiveTrack Sports Follow-Me Testing","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/05/dji-mavic4-pro-activetrack-testing-review.html","date":1747826403000,"content":"<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p>The DJI Mavic 4 Pro is different from most of the other sports-tracking drones I’ve tested over the past year (such as the <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/09/dji-neo-gauntlet-activetrack-testing.html\">DJI Neo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/03/hoverair-x1-pro-gauntlet-tracking.html\">HoverAir X1 Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/03/dji-flip-vs-activetrack-testing.html\">and DJI Flip</a>). Those drones don’t really care about their own safety while flying. They don’t have forward obstacle avoidance during tracking, and instead, aim to precisely follow your path, hoping that by mimicking it, it’ll keep them alive. Sometimes that works. And if it doesn’t, they’re designed to be crashed hundreds of times (well, some of them are anyways…).</p>\n<p>Whereas the Mavic 4 Pro is a beast, primarily in terms of size. But also technology inside. It’s got new lidar capabilities to detect tiny branches, even in total darkness. It’s got 6 additional cameras for obstacle avoidance (plus two sensors for ground detection). In many ways, it’s more like the DJI drones of the past when it comes to ActiveTrack than the newer generation of YOLOing mini sports drones. The question is: Can it bridge the gap and be both?</p>\n<p>Obviously, I set out to put that to the test, as always.</p>\n<p>In this video, I put my DJI Mavic 4 Pro through The Gauntlet and all its stages, to see how well it handles. Both in terms of obstacle avoidance (and crashes), as well as image quality, and the cameras that you’re allowed to use in ActiveTrack mode.</p>\n<p>To see how well this drone holds up, hit the play button up above. Even if you don’t care about drones, I suspect you’ll find it entertaining.</p>\n<p>Thanks for watching!</p>","author":"Ray Maker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"3a82c3be4d6814b0427dc1f12ae515161cc486ece245c5e5a4e54a0cc7840881","category":"Cycling"}
