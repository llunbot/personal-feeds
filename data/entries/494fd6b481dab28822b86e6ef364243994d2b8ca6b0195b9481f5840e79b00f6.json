What began as a solution to streamline running Docker containers on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a> has evolved into a cornerstone technology, offering both impressive performance and operational simplicity, including a serverless option with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/getting-started/?nc=sn&amp;loc=4\">AWS Fargate</a> for seamless container orchestration.</p> \n<p>Over the past decade, Amazon ECS has become a trusted solution for countless organizations, providing the reliability and performance that customers such as SmugMug rely on to power their operations without being bogged down by infrastructure challenges. As Andrew Shieh, Principal Engineer at <a href=\"https://www.smugmug.com/\">SmugMug</a>, shares, Amazon ECS has been the “unsung hero” behind their seamless transition to AWS and efficient handling of massive data operations, such as migrating petabytes of photos to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/getting-started/?nc=sn&amp;loc=6&amp;dn=1\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a>. “The blazingly fast container spin-ups allow us to deliver awesome experiences to our customers,” he adds. It’s this kind of dependable support that has made Amazon ECS a favorite among developers and platform teams, helping them scale their solutions and innovate over the years.</p> \n<p>In the early 2010s, as containerized services like Docker gained traction, developers started looking for efficient ways to manage and scale their applications in this new paradigm. Traditional infrastructure was cumbersome, and managing containers at scale was challenging. Amazon ECS arrived in 2014, just when developers were looking to adopt containers at scale. It offered a fully managed, and reliable solution that streamlined container orchestration on AWS. Teams could focus on building and deploying applications without the overhead of managing clusters or complex infrastructure, ushering in a new era of cloud-native development.</p> \n<p>When the Amazon ECS team set out to build the service, their vision was clear. As Deepak Singh, product manager who launched Amazon ECS now serving as VP of Next Generation Developer Experience, said at the time, “Our customers wanted a solution that was deeply integrated with AWS, that could work for them at scale and could grow as they grew.” Amazon ECS was designed to use the best of what AWS has to offer—scalability, availability, resilience, and security—to give customers the confidence to run their applications in production environments.</p> \n<p><strong>Evolution</strong><br /> Amazon ECS has consistently innovated for customers over the past decade. It marked the beginning of the container innovation journey at AWS, paving the way for a broader ecosystem of container-related services that have transformed how businesses build and manage applications.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/smartsheet-ecs-fargate-case-study/\">Smartsheet</a> proudly sings the praises of the significant impact that Amazon ECS, and especially AWS Fargate, had on their business to date. “Our teams can deploy more frequently, increase throughput, and reduce the engineering time to deploy from hours to minutes. We’ve gone from weekly deployments to deployments that we do multiple times a day. And from what used to be hours of at least two engineers’ time, we’ve been able to shave that down to several minutes,” said Skylar Graika, distinguished engineer at Smartsheet. ” Within the last year, we have been able to scale out its capacity by 50 times, and by leveraging deep integrations across AWS services, we have improved efficiencies and simplified our security and compliance process. Additionally, by adopting AWS Graviton with the Fargate deployments, we’ve seen a 20 percent reduction in cost.”</p> \n<p>Amazon ECS played a pivotal role as the starting point for a decade of container evolution at AWS and today, it still stands as one of the most scalable and reliable container orchestration solutions, powering massive operations such as Prime Day 2024, where <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/how-aws-powered-prime-day-2024-for-record-breaking-sales/\">Amazon launched an impressive 77.24 million ECS tasks</a>, Rufus, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/scaling-rufus-the-amazon-generative-ai-powered-conversational-shopping-assistant-with-over-80000-aws-inferentia-and-aws-trainium-chips-for-prime-day/\">a shopping assistant experience powered by generative AI that uses Amazon ECS as part of its core architecture</a> and so many others.</p> \n<p>Rustem Feyzkhanov, ML engineering manager at Instrumental, and AWS Machine Learning Hero, is quick to recognize the increased efficiency gained from adopting the service. “Amazon ECS has become an indispensable tool in our work,” says Rastem. “Over the past years, it has simplified container management and service scaling, allowing us to focus on development rather than infrastructure. This service makes it possible for application code teams to co-own infrastructure and that speeds up the development process.”</p> \n<p><strong>Timeline<br /> </strong>Let’s have a look at some of the key milestones that have shaped the evolution of ECS, marking pivotal moments that changed how customers harness the power of containers on AWS.</p> \n<p><strong>2014</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2014/11/13/introducing-amazon-ec2-container-service/\">Introducing Amazon EC2 Container Service</a>! – Check out this nostalgic blog post, which marked the release of ECS in preview mode. It shows how much functionality the service already launched with making a big impact from the get-go! Customers could already run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/getting-started/\">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</a> instances, with built-in resource management and task scheduling. It became generally available on April 9, 2015.</p> \n<p><strong>2015</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2015/12/amazon-ec2-container-service-supports-additional-cloudwatch-metrics/\">Amazon ECS auto-scaling</a> – With the introduction of added support for more Amazon CloudWatch metrics, customers could now automatically scale their clusters in and out by monitoring the CPU and memory usage in the cluster and configuring threshold values for auto scaling.
