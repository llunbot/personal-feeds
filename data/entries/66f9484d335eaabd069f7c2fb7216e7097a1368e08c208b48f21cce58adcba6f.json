Downloading the app and opening it up directs users to \"Open Partner App\" to choose a task. Tapping on the option launches another app called Premise.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPremise is a company that lets people earn rewards by \"completing simple tasks.\" The Premise app is described as a task marketplace that provides money for taking surveys, sharing local information like construction zones or grocery pricing, or taking pictures of city locations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nStrings in Apple's Surveyor app found by <em>MacRumors</em> suggest that once assigned a mapping task by the Premise app, Premise users will be instructed to attach an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> to a mount, rotate the ‌iPhone‌ to landscape orientation, and capture images along a route while driving using the Surveyor app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Surveyor app says that images are being captured of items along the road like signs and traffic lights, location and data about physical features sent to Apple to \"precisely place objects on the map.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPremise is not listed as an ‌Apple Maps‌ partner in Apple's mapping data information, but the app suggests that Apple is using data collected by Premise users for the purpose of keeping small details in ‌Apple Maps‌ up to date.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/\">Apple Maps</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/14/apple-maps-surveyor-app/\">Apple Launches 'Surveyor' App for Apple Maps Data Collection</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-surveyor-app-for-apple-maps-data-collection.2453127/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"66f9484d335eaabd069f7c2fb7216e7097a1368e08c208b48f21cce58adcba6f","category":"Apple"}
