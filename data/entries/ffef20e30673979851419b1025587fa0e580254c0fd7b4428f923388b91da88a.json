With an 11.5″ inseam, this version of the Ramble Scramble is great for those with longer legs, who combine kneepads with their gear, or who just want more coverage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ramble Scramble Long features a stretchy, durable 100% polyester body. It’s decked out with classic 5-pocket styling, a drop-in side pocket, and a secure phone pocket on the side. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Curious-Creatures-2024-Ramble-Scramble-Long-colors.jpeg\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Curious-Creatures-2024-Ramble-Scramble-Long-colors.jpeg\" alt=\"Curious Creatures 2024 Ramble Scramble Long colors\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Curious-Creatures-2024-Ramble-Scramble-Long-colors.jpeg 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Curious-Creatures-2024-Ramble-Scramble-Long-colors-297x297.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Curious-Creatures-2024-Ramble-Scramble-Long-colors-120x120.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Curious-Creatures-2024-Ramble-Scramble-Long-colors-768x768.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a subtle tonal color pop on the back pocket maintaining the brand’s sense of fun and irreverence. The fabric is 100% polyester for moisture management and performance, using a bio-based stretch yarn instead of spandex. Therefore making the shorts recyclable at the end of their life. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Curious-Creatures-2024-Ramble-Scramble-Long-hands-in-pockets.jpeg\"><img width=\"960\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Curious-Creatures-2024-Ramble-Scramble-Long-hands-in-pockets.jpeg\" alt=\"Curious Creatures 2024 Ramble Scramble Long hands in pockets\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Curious-Creatures-2024-Ramble-Scramble-Long-hands-in-pockets.jpeg 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Curious-Creatures-2024-Ramble-Scramble-Long-hands-in-pockets-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Curious-Creatures-2024-Ramble-Scramble-Long-hands-in-pockets-90x120.jpeg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Curious-Creatures-2024-Ramble-Scramble-Long-hands-in-pockets-768x1024.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally requested by men, the Ramble Scramble Long comes in standard men’s sizing.
