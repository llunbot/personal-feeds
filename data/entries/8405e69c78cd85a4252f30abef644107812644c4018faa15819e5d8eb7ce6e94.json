Pick from a more compact long tail cargo ebike (<em>not so dissimilar to Globe’s new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/specialized-globe-haul-lt-cargo-ebike-extends-a-long-tail-to-haul-more/\" target=\"_blank\">Haul LT</a></em>), or go all-in with a big box out front to haul more kids and bigger objects out front. Either way then, it looks like two more reasons for urban &amp; suburban families to seriously consider adopting the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/onelesscar/\" target=\"_blank\">#onelesscar</a> concept..</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cannondale Cargowagen &amp; Wonderwagen Neo cargo ebikes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale is fully embracing (<em>small</em>) two wheels and e-mobility as alternative transportation with their two new cargo ebikes. No matter where you stand on the ebikes on the road &amp; trail debate, cargo ebikes are awesome – that is assuming you have somewhere to park these behemoths.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Cargowagen-Neo-long-tail-cargo-ebike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Cargowagen-Neo-long-tail-cargo-ebike.jpg\" alt=\"Cannondale Cargowagen Neo long tail cargo ebike, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Cargowagen-Neo-long-tail-cargo-ebike.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Cargowagen-Neo-long-tail-cargo-ebike-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Cargowagen-Neo-long-tail-cargo-ebike-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Cargowagen-Neo-long-tail-cargo-ebike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Cargowagen-Neo-long-tail-cargo-ebike-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Cargowagen-Neo-long-tail-cargo-ebike-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Cargowagen-Neo-long-tail-cargo-ebike-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all c.

It also uses cable-driven steering instead of a linkage to keep the cargo box and all that weight low. All-in, the Wonderwagen can haul 3 kids in addition to the driver/rider – with a max total load rating of 250kg/551lb (ebike, rider &amp; load).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Powering it all, Cannondale gives these two e-cargo setups Bosch ebike motors to get ’em moving. In Europe, that’s the 25kph limited high-torque Bosch Cargo Line. On the other hand, in the US, it’s the high-speed 28mph-limited Bosch Performance Speed electric motor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Wonderwagen-Neo-cargo-ebike_riding.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Wonderwagen-Neo-cargo-ebike_riding.jpg\" alt=\"Cannondale Wonderwagen Neo long john bakfiets cargo ebike, headlights rriding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Wonderwagen-Neo-cargo-ebike_riding.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Wonderwagen-Neo-cargo-ebike_riding-225x300.jpg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Wonderwagen-Neo-cargo-ebike_riding-800x1067.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Wonderwagen-Neo-cargo-ebike_riding-90x120.jpg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Wonderwagen-Neo-cargo-ebike_riding-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Wonderwagen-Neo-cargo-ebike_riding-1152x1536.jpg 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Cargowagen-Neo-cargo-ebike_riding.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Cargowagen-Neo-cargo-ebike_riding.jpg\" alt=\"Cannondale Cargowagen Neo long tail cargo ebike, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Cargowagen-Neo-cargo-ebike_riding.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Cargowagen-Neo-cargo-ebike_riding-225x300.jpg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Cargowagen-Neo-cargo-ebike_riding-800x1067.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Cargowagen-Neo-cargo-ebike_riding-90x120.jpg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Cargowagen-Neo-cargo-ebike_riding-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cannondale-Cargowagen-Neo-cargo-ebike_riding-1152x1536.jpg 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both get powerful integrated lighting – check out the cool headlights on the Wonderwagen, full-coverage fenders, dropper seatposts, kickstands, a built-in glove box, and integrated locks. Plus, then there’s lots of other accessories to choose from, including optional dual-battery setups and even a trailer hitch. The rear racks are designed to clip on a traditional kids’ seat, a cargo cage, or pannier bags. The Cargowagen can even add an extra min front rack.
