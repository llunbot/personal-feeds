This seems to apply even when Nintendo has not actually moved to block something, but merely seems like it might.</p>\n<p>That's why, one week after announcing that his years-long \"demake\" of Valve's classic <em>Portal </em>to the Nintendo 64 platform had its \"First Slice\" ready for players, James Lambert has <a href=\"https://github.com/lambertjamesd/portal64/tree/61d225e9a438b917cfbd4cb544a2f0e62cdad2ca\">taken down <em>Portal 64</em></a>. There's no DMCA takedown letter or even a cease-and-desist from Nintendo. There is, as <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/that-portal-64-demake-we-liked-so-much-has-been-kiboshed-by-valve-they-have-asked-me-to-take-the-project-down-creator-says/\">Lambert told PC Gamer</a>, \"communication with Valve\" that \"because the project depends on Nintendo's proprietary libraries, [Valve] have asked me to take the project down.\"</p>\n<p>Ars contacted Valve and Nintendo for comment and will update the post with any new information. Lambert could not be reached for comment.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995660#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995660&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1e71f37322950a0c66908f80ed40cb9ec22880ca2b77208b8ce481090b6268cd","category":"Tech"}
