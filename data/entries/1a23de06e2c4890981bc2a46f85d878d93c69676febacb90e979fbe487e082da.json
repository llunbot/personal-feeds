{"title":"Harvard, M.I.T., and Penn Presidents Under Fire After Dodging Questions About Antisemitism","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/us/harvard-mit-penn-presidents-antisemitism.html","date":1701987969000,"content":"\n<p>Stephanie Saul and Anemona Hartocollis, reporting for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Support for the presidents of Harvard, the University of \nPennsylvania and M.I.T. eroded quickly on Wednesday, after they \nseemed to evade what seemed like a rather simple question during a \ncontentious congressional hearing: Would they discipline students \ncalling for the genocide of Jews? </p>\n\n<p>Their lawyerly replies to that question and others during a \nfour-hour hearing drew incredulous responses. “It’s unbelievable \nthat this needs to be said: Calls for genocide are monstrous and \nantithetical to everything we represent as a country,” said a \nWhite House spokesman, Andrew Bates. [...] </p>\n\n<p>Much of the criticism landed heavily on Ms. Magill because of an \nextended back-and-forth with Representative Stefanik. Ms. Stefanik \nsaid that in campus protests, students had chanted support for \nintifada, an Arabic word that means uprising and that many Jews \nhear as a call for violence against them. Ms. Stefanik asked Ms. \nMagill, “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Penn’s \nrules or code of conduct, yes or no?” </p>\n\n<p>Ms. Magill replied, “If the speech turns into conduct, it can be \nharassment.” </p>\n\n<p>Ms. Stefanik pressed the issue: “I am asking, specifically: \nCalling for the genocide of Jews, does that constitute bullying or \nharassment?” </p>\n\n<p>Ms. Magill, a lawyer who joined Penn last year with a pledge to \npromote campus free speech, replied, “If it is directed and \nsevere, pervasive, it is harassment.” </p>\n\n<p>Ms. Stefanik responded: “So the answer is yes.” </p>\n\n<p>Ms. Magill said, “It is a context-dependent decision, \ncongresswoman.” </p>\n\n<p>Ms. Stefanik exclaimed: “That’s your testimony today? Calling for \nthe genocide of Jews is depending upon the context?” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The reckoning has come for the bizarro-world political climate that’s taken hold at these universities in the last decade or two. This patently offensive equivocation — when the correct answer was obviously an unambiguous “Yes” — makes sense in the context of the insular far-left worldview where the oppressed are viewed as inherently just, but comes across as absurd to everyone living in the real world. All three of these elite university presidents are obviously utterly tone-deaf and detached from the real world.</p>\n\n<p>You can only pretend to live in a bubble for so long. <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/12/07/upenn-antisemitism-magill-100-million-donation\">Then the bill comes due</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/07/harvard-mit-penn-presidents-antisemitism\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1a23de06e2c4890981bc2a46f85d878d93c69676febacb90e979fbe487e082da","category":"Tech"}
