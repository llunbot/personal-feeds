They also looked at the options already out there (at the time, that was pretty much just the original Fox AX fork) and benchmarked their concept against that.

The lower spring is to maintain pressure on the damper to prevent cavitation…kinda like an IFP, except with less friction.</p></div><p>The tricky part was making a damping system light enough to handle the tiny movements coming from these vibrations. In their words, it’s a fairly sophisticated system, but uses simple steel coil springs to keep seal pressure light.</p><p>An air spring would be lighter, but the much higher seal pressure to contain the air would have introduced stiction. Even the damper uses a low-pressure design to keep the seals light. And, it uses two roller bearings between the tubes, so there are no bushings to create drag, either. You can see it in action in the video above…it’s <em>smooooooth</em>.</p><div id=\"attachment_272742\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075926/2022-BMC-URS-full-susp-gravel-bike-5.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-272742\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075926/2022-BMC-URS-full-susp-gravel-bike-5.jpg\" alt=\"bmc urs lt full suspension gravel bike closeup on fork lockout and top tube mounts\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075926/2022-BMC-URS-full-susp-gravel-bike-5.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075926/2022-BMC-URS-full-susp-gravel-bike-5-200x300.jpg 200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075926/2022-BMC-URS-full-susp-gravel-bike-5-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075926/2022-BMC-URS-full-susp-gravel-bike-5-80x120.jpg 80w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075926/2022-BMC-URS-full-susp-gravel-bike-5-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075926/2022-BMC-URS-full-susp-gravel-bike-5-1024x1536.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-272742\">A lockout knob sits on the top of the steerer tube.</p></div><p>Despite cramming all of that into the head tube, steerer length and stack height are still fully adjustable.

It comes stock with the medium-rate spring and spacer. Unfortunately, it needs a special tool to swap them out, but your BMC dealer will have those, and the aftermarket springs and spacers.</p><p>BMC recommends tuning it to 5mm of sag, which gives the fork room to rebound into small dips and maintain traction better. The sweet spot of usable travel is the middle ~12mm, with bottom- and top-out bumpers to prevent hard smacks.</p><p>This isn’t the first use of HiRide’s steerer tube fork, it <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2019/04/11/pinarello-dogma-fs-drops-in-electronically-controlled-ultralight-full-suspension-road-bike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">debuted on the Pinarello Dogma FS</a> along with their electronically controlled rear shock.

It also makes it easier to service.</p><p>They say the complete fork is just 1200g, only about 750g more than their standard rigid fork, but still a couple hundred grams (or more) lighter than a traditional suspension fork.</p><h2>URS LT geometry, pricing &amp; specs</h2><div id=\"attachment_272759\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25084702/BMC-URS-LT-geometry-chart.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-272759\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25084702/BMC-URS-LT-geometry-chart.gif\" alt=\"geometry chart for bmc urs lt gravel bike\" width=\"1578\" height=\"796\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-272759\">With 5mm of sag on the fork, the URS LT geometry matches the original URS.</p></div><p>BMC’s Gravel+ Geometry uses a slack, 70º head angle with a long front end and wheelbase for good high-speed stability, but short stems to keep the reach normal and low-speed handling sharp.</p><p>Key specs and features include:</p><ul><li>Tuned Compliance Concept (TCC) carbon layup</li><li>1150g claimed frame weight (size Medium)</li><li>1x drivetrains only</li><li>45mm tire clearance</li><li>Integrated downtube protection</li><li>D-fender fender-compatible seatpost</li><li>Internal dynamo cable routing on right fork leg</li><li>Dropper post compatible with adapter to use a 27.2 round seatpost</li><li>Rack and fender compatible</li><li>Top tube bag mounts</li><li>Three bottle cage mounts (one under downtube)</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075956/bmc-urs-lt-one-spec-sheet.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075956/bmc-urs-lt-one-spec-sheet.jpg\" alt=\"bmc urs lt one gravel bike spec sheet\" width=\"1600\" height=\"834\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075956/bmc-urs-lt-one-spec-sheet.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075956/bmc-urs-lt-one-spec-sheet-297x155.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075956/bmc-urs-lt-one-spec-sheet-800x417.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075956/bmc-urs-lt-one-spec-sheet-120x63.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075956/bmc-urs-lt-one-spec-sheet-768x400.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075956/bmc-urs-lt-one-spec-sheet-1536x801.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The URS LT launches with two builds and colors, both using SRAM Eagle mountain bike rear derailleurs and cassettes paired with road cranks and 38-tooth chainrings.</p><p>The top level URS LT One comes in mustard yellow and will retail for $7,999 (€7,999 / £7,600).</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075959/bmc-urs-lt-two-spec-sheet.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075959/bmc-urs-lt-two-spec-sheet.jpg\" alt=\"bmc urs lt two gravel bike spec sheet\" width=\"1600\" height=\"828\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075959/bmc-urs-lt-two-spec-sheet.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075959/bmc-urs-lt-two-spec-sheet-297x154.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075959/bmc-urs-lt-two-spec-sheet-800x414.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075959/bmc-urs-lt-two-spec-sheet-120x62.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075959/bmc-urs-lt-two-spec-sheet-768x397.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/25075959/bmc-urs-lt-two-spec-sheet-1536x795.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>URS LT Two comes in gray and will retail for $6,299 (€5,999 / £5,700).
