And in most ways, it's a straightforward update, with no major changes to the laptop's physical design, screen specs, keyboard, or ports.</p>\n<p>The most important update is the price. The 13-inch M4 MacBook Air will start at $999, a $100 price cut compared to the M3 Air and the same price that Apple set for the M2 Air last year when the M3 models came out. The 15-inch model will also get a $100 cut, from $1,299 to $1,199. These baseline configurations still come with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, plus the 8-core version of the M4's GPU.</p>\n<p>The M2 version will continue to be sold as a budget model in some countries, but the US isn't one of them. Apple will also continue to sell a cheaper version of the M1 MacBook Air through Walmart, which it has been <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/walmart-resurrects-the-m1-macbook-air-as-an-entry-level-699-laptop/\">doing since March 2024</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/macbook-air-gets-the-m4-a-new-blue-color-up-to-32gb-of-ram-and-a-100-price-cut/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/macbook-air-gets-the-m4-a-new-blue-color-up-to-32gb-of-ram-and-a-100-price-cut/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d234fa66bc918a77833ef357ac9c852d3c08c2cdb5864809d5d2582643a7a778","category":"Tech"}
