According to the latest post on the matter, the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max will be an \"image flagship,\" suggesting that it will be heavily focused on its camera capabilities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe device's main camera will apparently feature a customized 48-megapixel Sony IMX903 sensor with advanced features like a stacked design for better performance, a 14-bit Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) for high-quality image data conversion, and Digital Gain Control (DCG) for better dynamic range and noise control.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Weibo user also reiterated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/28/iphone-16-pro-size-increase-camera-upgrades/\">their previous claim</a> that the ‌‌iPhone 16 Pro‌‌ Max will feature a 12% larger camera sensor that is 1/1.14-inches in size. The ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a>‌ Pro and ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models currently feature a 1/1.28-inch sensor. A larger sensor could improve the main ‌iPhone‌ camera's dynamic range and background blur, as well as substantially enhance low-light photography capabilities since a bigger surface area can capture more light with the same shutter speed and aperture.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe leaker also mentioned in passing that the next-generation high-end iPhones will feature a slightly more curved screen design, iterating on the design introduced with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> lineup last year. Corroborating information <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/29/iphone-16-preliminary-weights-dimensions/\">shared by <em>MacRumors</em></a> last year, the post added that the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ models will have virtually the same thickness as their predecessors. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nDigital Chat Station accurately revealed that the ‌iPhone 15‌ and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus would feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/27/iphone-15-still-to-have-smaller-sensor-than-pros/\">slightly smaller 48-megapixel sensor</a> than the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max last year, as well as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/27/5-4-inch-iphone-12-display-images/\">display panel design</a> of the ‌iPhone‌ 12 back in 2020. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> lineup is expected to debut in the fall.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/\">Digital Chat Station</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/24/iphone-16-pro-max-to-feature-advanced-main-sensor/\">iPhone 16 Pro Max Rumored to Feature Bigger, More Advanced Main Camera Sensor</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-max-rumored-to-feature-bigger-more-advanced-main-camera-sensor.2417293/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e323cc1712ef03ad4f318f26871614bf9c0cb66271eec93f0b2fff0240e9f4b6","category":"Apple"}
