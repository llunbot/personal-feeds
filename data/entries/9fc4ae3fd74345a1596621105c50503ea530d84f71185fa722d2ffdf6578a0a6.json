As of right now, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Hawaii, California, Ohio, Iowa, and New Mexico have implemented support.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAcording to Apple, Connecticut, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Utah, Montana, and West Virginia are also working to implement the feature.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/\">Apple Wallet</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/05/iphone-drivers-license-support-new-mexico/\">iPhone Driver's License Support in Wallet Expands to New Mexico</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-drivers-license-support-in-wallet-expands-to-new-mexico.2444692/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9fc4ae3fd74345a1596621105c50503ea530d84f71185fa722d2ffdf6578a0a6","category":"Apple"}
