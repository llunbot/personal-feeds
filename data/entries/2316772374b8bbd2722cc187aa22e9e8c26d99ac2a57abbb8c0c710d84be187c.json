Developers have access to the software so they can begin incorporating all of the new features into their apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-tile-summary.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nRegistered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app on their device, going to the Software Update Section, tapping on the \"Beta Updates\" option, and toggling on the Developer Beta. Note that an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta, but Apple allows even free developer accounts to install beta software.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is a bad idea to install early betas on a main device, and we recommend having a secondary device if you want to try out the software. There are often significant bugs in early versions of iOS and macOS, so if you do install on a main device, make sure to create a backup beforehand.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOver the course of the next several months, Apple will refine the features available in all of its new software, and we will go through several betas before the updates see a public release around September.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the betas are limited to developers right now, Apple typically provides a public beta in July, which is usually much more stable than the early developer betas.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/\">macOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/\">watchOS 10</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-first-developer-betas-new-software/\">Apple Releases First Betas of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia, tvOS 18, watchOS 11, and visionOS 2</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-first-betas-of-ios-18-ipados-18-macos-sequoia-tvos-18-watchos-11-and-visionos-2.2428680/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2316772374b8bbd2722cc187aa22e9e8c26d99ac2a57abbb8c0c710d84be187c","category":"Apple"}
