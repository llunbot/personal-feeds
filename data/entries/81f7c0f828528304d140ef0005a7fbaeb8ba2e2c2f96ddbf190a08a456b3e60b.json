The biggest news came in the form of NASA's formal acknowledgement that a human landing on the Moon in 2024 is not possible, but there were plenty of other noteworthy tidbits.</p>\n<p>NASA Administrator Bill Nelson led the briefing with space reporters, which came five days after the US Court of Federal Claims <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/blue-origin-suffers-grave-setback-as-judge-dismisses-lawsuit-against-nasa/\">ruled against</a> Blue Origin's lawsuit against NASA for its selection of SpaceX to build a lunar lander for the Artemis Program. Previously, Nelson had promised to provide an update on the Artemis Program following the lawsuit, and on Tuesday he made good on that.</p>\n<p>He came out guns blazing at Blue Origin. \"We've lost nearly seven months in litigation and that likely has pushed the first human landing likely to no earlier than 2025,\" Nelson said, pinning the delay in NASA's return to the Moon firmly on Blue Origin and its lawyers. During the legal process, NASA was forbidden from working or even talking with SpaceX regarding the Human Landing System (HLS) program. The agency was also unable to provide milestone payments.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811660#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811660&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"81f7c0f828528304d140ef0005a7fbaeb8ba2e2c2f96ddbf190a08a456b3e60b","category":"Tech"}
