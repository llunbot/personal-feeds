We call it Apple Breakfast because we think it goes great with a Monday morning cup of coffee or tea, but it‚Äôs cool if you want to give it a read during lunch or dinner hours too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Copy that</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Imitation is supposed to be the sincerest form of flattery, but I don‚Äôt advise readers to rely on that defense in court. Not even if you‚Äôre one of the biggest technology companies in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It remains to be seen, admittedly, whether Samsung is about to find itself in court. But let‚Äôs just say that the signs aren‚Äôt promising. As one <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://x.com/citruswink/status/1806637635630236014&amp;xcust=1-1-2375051-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter wag</a> has pointed out, the <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/2380366/i-wont-be-buying-a-galaxy-watch-ultra-if-these-leaks-are-true.html\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and the Samsung Buds 3 are so close to their Apple equivalents that it‚Äôs hard to believe the whole thing is a coincidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Apple Watch &amp; Samsung Watch<br /><br />Apple Airpod &amp; Samsung Buds 3 Pro<br /><br />I need to know what Samsung is smoking. üôÇ Because this is just‚Ä¶ <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://t.co/4lMNA1EXgF&amp;xcust=1-1-2375051-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/4lMNA1EXgF</a></p>‚Äî Dillon Horsfall (@citruswink) <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://twitter.com/citruswink/status/1806637635630236014?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2375051-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">June 28, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We‚Äôve been here before. Between 2011 and 2018 Apple and Samsung fought bitterly in courts around the world, accusing one another of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/669801/apple-v-samsung-complete-summary-of-patent-trial-updated.html\">violating smartphone patents</a>. Apple pointed out that Samsung phones (namely the i9000 model of the Galaxy S) looked quite a lot like its own phones (namely the iPhone 3GS) and asked for action to be taken. Seven years and a small fortune in lawyers‚Äô fees later it felt like very little had been resolved, but I suppose a point of sorts had been made: copy our designs and at the very least you‚Äôll be dragged through a long and costly legal process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amid that case, incidentally, I got to make my one and only appearance on national TV when ‚Äúexpert‚Äù analysis was required on a news show. It‚Äôs possible that the bookers had overestimated my ability to explain copyright law to a teatime audience, but I did have some success with an analogy between smartphones and microwaves. (I always say that a good analogy is like a friend who‚Äôs better at explaining things.) Microwave ovens all look the same, I argued, because that device‚Äôs evolution arrived at an optimal design and there was no longer anything to gain by changing the fundamentals. At some point, smartphones will reach that point too, and they may have done so already. The legal system will need to be able to account for that, or we‚Äôll just be forcing some of the companies to make worse handsets for the sake of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that was then, and this is now, and it must be admitted that the latest case of imitation/flattery feels more blatant than the case of the Galaxy S and the iPhone 3GS. Based on leaked images, the Samsung Buds 3 Pro don‚Äôt just look like they copied the fundamentals of a pleasing rival design‚Äîthey look <em>exactly like</em> a pair of AirPods. They look, in fact, like one of those scam products designed to trick you into thinking you‚Äôre holding the real thing, right up until you notice they‚Äôre called AirPro Pods and cost $11.99. As for the band and the squarish rugged look of the Galaxy Watch Ultra‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just say that using a slightly different shade of orange doesn‚Äôt count as designing your own product. I mean, even the back and the band-swapping mechanism appear to be carbon copies of the Apple Watch Ultra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a different time, the Cupertino legal team would be currently assembling, like Voltron in expensive shoes, and gearing up for another epic battle. And perhaps they are. But such a battle won‚Äôt achieve anything except cost both companies a great deal of money and give tech websites something to talk about. But maybe, on some level, Tim Cook can just smile about the whole thing. For a rival company to be driven to this level of desperate mimicry, the AirPods and the Apple Watch must be truly great products, or at least products that every consumer wants to own. And maybe there‚Äôs something to that old saying about imitation and flattery after all.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trending: Top stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AI is a mess</strong> and Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2375909/ai-is-a-questionable-technology.html\">here to clean it up</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2379750/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-vs-m3-apple-silicon-cpu-gpu-performance.html\">Arm race</a>: How Apple‚Äôs M3 squares off against the <strong>Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is an <strong>Apple Vision SE</strong> the key to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2377065/apples-vision-strategy-comes-into-focus.html\">spatial computing‚Äôs success</a>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple‚Äôs <strong>HomePod</strong> speakers <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2376876/apple-intelligence-homepod-siri-hardware-specs-chatgpt-private-cloud-compute.html\">aren‚Äôt as smart</a> as we thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Podcast of the week</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What‚Äôs going on with Apple‚Äôs next phone, the <strong>iPhone 16</strong>?
