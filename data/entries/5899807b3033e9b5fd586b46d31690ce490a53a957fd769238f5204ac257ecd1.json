It’s a great way to give your old stuff a new lease of life and help other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For bikes, <a href=\"https://thebikeproject.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">The Bike Project</a> is one charity that takes in second-hand bikes, refurbishes them and donates them to refugees and people seeking asylum in the UK. The project has donated over 11,000 bikes so far. If the bike is beyond repair, it will be dismantled, and its various parts will be reused to rebuild other bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re based in or near Scotland, try <a href=\"https://www.bikesforrefugees.scot/\" target=\"_blank\">Bikes for Refugees Scotland</a>, it’s dedicated to providing bikes for refugees and asylum seekers in Scotland.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bikes-for-refugees-yaman-970x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bikes-for-refugees-yaman-970x970.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bikes-for-refugees-yaman-300x300.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bikes-for-refugees-yaman-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bikes-for-refugees-yaman-768x768.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bikes-for-refugees-yaman-75x75.jpg 75w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bikes-for-refugees-yaman-350x350.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bikes-for-refugees-yaman-750x750.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bikes-for-refugees-yaman.jpg 1080w\" /><figcaption>Bikes for Refugees Scotland</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thebikenetwork.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Bike Network</a> is another great option.

You can drop your bike off at various places including at <a href=\"https://www.halfords.com/bikes/services-advice/re-cycle.html\" target=\"_blank\">Halfords</a> stores nationwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alpkit has a similar project where it donates outdoor clothing and equipment to those in need through its <a href=\"https://alpkit.com/pages/continuum\" target=\"_blank\">Continuum project</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Local cycling clubs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Chances are there are plenty of things in your cupboard a youngster could really benefit from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The amount of gear needed for cycling can be overwhelming, not least on the purse strings, so contact your local cycling club to see if you can pass on a few things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From unworn bib shorts to hardly worn jackets, to barely used equipment, all these things could really benefit someone getting into cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.

Recycling carbon fibre is an issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way carbon fibre is structured and the resins that bind the composite together make it complicated to recycle, and this process is incredibly energy-intensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add in the relatively small size of a bicycle and thus the amount of carbon fibre, and this recycling process becomes less and less attractive for companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the aviation industry where the sheer amount of carbon fibre waste produced means that a recycling programme is profitable, the numbers don’t stack up for bikes. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"836\" height=\"477\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/greener-bicycle-manufacturing-02.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/greener-bicycle-manufacturing-02.jpg 836w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/greener-bicycle-manufacturing-02-300x171.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/greener-bicycle-manufacturing-02-768x438.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/greener-bicycle-manufacturing-02-750x428.jpg 750w\" /><figcaption>CompLam</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Innovation is happening in the industry however.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taiwan-based CompLam claims to have devised methods to recycle both manufacturing scrap and end-user carbon waste into usable material.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>US company Vartega Carbon Fiber Recycling has a novel chemistry-based recycling process for carbon bicycles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But widespread and accessible for the consumer? We are watching this space with hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, it’s worth contacting brands directly to ask if they offer recycling – some may and the more people enquire, the more likely brands are to take the idea seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article was first published in 2023 and has since been updated by the Cyclist team.</em></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hunt-sustain-wheels\">Hunt Sustain wheels use recycled materials to reduce environmental impact as brand aims for net zero</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/steel-bike-frame-environmental-impact\">What’s the environmental impact of a steel bicycle frame?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-hidden-cost-of-the-tour\">Examining the environmental impact of the Tour de France</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-green-is-cycling-kit\">How green is my jersey?
