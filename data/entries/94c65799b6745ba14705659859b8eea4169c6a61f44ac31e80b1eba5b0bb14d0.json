[credit:\n                        Netflix                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>One month after its vague announcement of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/netflix-will-start-publishing-video-games-has-hired-former-ea-exec/\">a new gaming-centric strategy</a>, Netflix has explained how it will \"publish\" video games in the foreseeable future: as downloadable smartphone apps, available exclusively for paying video-streaming subscribers.</p>\n<p>The news coincides with the company's public launch of Netflix Gaming on Thursday as part of the service's smartphone app... but only in Poland—and only on Android. The company's American Twitter translated Thursday's Polish announcement, which explains how the service works. It also announced the two games launching as part of the service today: <em>Stranger Things 3</em>, a 16-bit beat-'em-up that was previously available as a standalone Google Play purchase (and is still live on PC and consoles); and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.NGP.StrangerThings\"><em>Stranger Things: 1984</em></a>, a rebranding of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgLQLA2CQMI\">a 2017 smartphone-exclusive game</a> that revolve around slow, puzzle-solving movement through pixelated TV-series environments. (Both games, coincidentally, were made by the same indie game studio, <a href=\"https://bonusxp.com/\">BonusXP</a>, which is based in Texas, not Poland.)</p>\n<p>To access this content, you'll need to log in to Netflix's Android app while using a Polish IP address, then open the region's new \"N Gaming\" row of icons (pictured below). From there, pick either of those games, and the app will direct you to their Google Play download listings. Once downloaded, the apps in question will request your Netflix credentials before loading, and they will not work without an active Netflix membership.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790000#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790000&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"94c65799b6745ba14705659859b8eea4169c6a61f44ac31e80b1eba5b0bb14d0","category":"Tech"}
