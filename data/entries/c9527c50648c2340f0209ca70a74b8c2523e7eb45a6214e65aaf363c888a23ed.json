{"title":"Fallout: London is a huge Fallout 4 mod that is now playableâ€”and worth playing","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/fallout-london-is-a-huge-fallout-4-mod-that-is-now-playable-and-worth-playing/","date":1729855805000,"content":"<p>It took a crew of more than 100 talented modders and another hundred voice actors nearly five years to make <a href=\"https://fallout4london.com/\"><em>Fallout: London</em></a>. Just as they planned to release it, Bethesda <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/fallout-london-devs-will-downgrade-fallout-4-to-save-their-massive-mod/\">came out with a \"next-gen upgrade\" of the mod's base game</a>, <em>Fallout 4</em>, forcing the team to scramble and ultimately find a way to downgrade the game. When they finally released <em>London</em>, they then dealt with game-stopping bugs and quality issues that their small QA team could not have caught. It's been a long, maybe even post-apocalyptic road for these modders.</p>\n<p>A few updates later, <em>Fallout: London</em> is in much better shape. I've been able to put about 12 hours into it, and that, in itself, is essentially my review: it is worth that kind of time and more. If you can still enjoy <em>Fallout 4</em>, of course.</p>\n<p>Any Fallout fan waits a long time between official releases, so it can be tempting to go easy on any new offering, however spit-and-bailing-wire it may seem. But <em>Fallout: London </em>is a game in its own right, with a distinct look, vision, and stories to tell. You can find evidence of its unofficial mod-ness if you look around, but you're better off doing the <em>Fallout</em> thing: wandering, wondering, fighting, and occasionally talking to some messed-up weirdo.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/fallout-london-is-a-huge-fallout-4-mod-that-is-now-playable-and-worth-playing/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/fallout-london-is-a-huge-fallout-4-mod-that-is-now-playable-and-worth-playing/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c9527c50648c2340f0209ca70a74b8c2523e7eb45a6214e65aaf363c888a23ed","category":"Tech"}
