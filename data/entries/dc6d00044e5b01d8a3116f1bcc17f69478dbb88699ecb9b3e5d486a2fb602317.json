Apple and Mozilla both killed off the user-tracking technology <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192830/apple-safari-intelligent-tracking-privacy-full-third-party-cookie-blocking\">in 2020</a>. Google, the world's largest advertising company, originally said it wouldn't kill third-party cookies <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/01/google-plans-to-drop-chrome-support-for-tracking-cookies-by-2022/\">until 2022</a>. Then in 2021, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/google-delays-floc-rollout-until-2023/\">it delayed</a> the change until 2023. In 2022, it delayed everything again, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/google-delays-death-of-tracking-cookies-again-wants-more-time-for-testing/\">until 2024</a>. It's 2024 now, and guess what? Another delay. Now Google says it won't turn off third-party cookies until 2025, five years after the competition.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en_us/news/update-on-the-plan-for-phase-out-of-third-party-cookies-on-chrome/\">new blog post</a> cites UK regulations as the reason for the delay, saying, \"We recognize that there are ongoing challenges related to reconciling divergent feedback from the industry, regulators and developers, and will continue to engage closely with the entire ecosystem.\" The post comes as part of the quarterly reports the company is producing with the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the UK’s CMA isn't concerned about user privacy but instead is worried about other web advertisers that compete with Google. The UK wants to make sure that Google isn't making changes to Chrome to prop up its advertising business at the expense of competitors. While other browser vendors shut down third-party cookies without a second thought, Google said it wouldn't turn off the user-tracking feature until it built an alternative advertising feature directly into Chrome, so it can track user interests to serve them relevant ads. The new advertising system, called the Topics API and \"Privacy Sandbox,\" <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/googles-widely-opposed-ad-platform-the-privacy-sandbox-launches-in-chrome/\">launched in Chrome</a> in 2023. Google AdSense is <a href=\"https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/12567752?hl=en\">already compatible</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019664#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019664&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"dc6d00044e5b01d8a3116f1bcc17f69478dbb88699ecb9b3e5d486a2fb602317","category":"Tech"}
