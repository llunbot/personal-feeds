That’s the motivation for component brand Tenet who just updated its Nora stem. The <a href=\"https://ridetenet.com/collections/hardgoods/products/nora-o35-v2-5-stem\" target=\"_blank\">Nora V2.5</a> stem is designed with modern bike geometry and short offset forks in mind. These are designed for a  ø35mm clamp bar, thus the shortest length you could go is 32mm. From there, Tenet increased the stem length by 5mm increments, matching the fork offsets of 37mm and 42mm nicely. Most brands that offer bikes with modern geometry recommend running a stem as close to your fork offset as possible. These stems are machined in Bellingham, Washington, from North American sourced 6061-T6 aluminum and carry a retail price of $134.
