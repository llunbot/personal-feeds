Black Friday sales are also now in full swing, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple to Adopt RCS Messaging Standard for Better Interoperability With Android Devices</h2>\r<br />\nIn a bit of shocking news this week, Apple announced that it will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/\">add support for the Rich Communication Standard (RCS) standard</a> \"later next year,\" allowing for better messaging interoperability with Android devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-rcs-thumb.jpg\" width=\"2776\" height=\"1562\" />\r<br />\nApple has long resisted adopting the successor to SMS and MMS messaging amid intense pressure from Google and Android device manufacturers, and it's unclear exactly what has changed Apple's mind other than perhaps ongoing pressure from regulators on various aspects of the company's business.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile RCS will remain separate from iMessage, it will bring a number of advancements for communication between Apple and Android users, including enhanced security, higher-resolution photos and videos, audio messages, and much-improved group chats.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone 16 Series Rumored to Have These 17 New Features</h2>\r<br />\nIt's still only November, but weâ€™ve been hearing about a decent number of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/15/iphone-16-series-16-rumored-new-features/\">potential upgrades for next year's flagship iPhone lineup</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iPhone-16-Mock-Header-Updated-1.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nFrom bigger displays on the Pro models to camera improvements and more, it looks like 2024 should be a good year for those who are ready to make the jump to a new iPhone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone App Sideloading Coming to Users in the EU in First Half of 2024</h2>\r<br />\niPhone users in the EU next year will be able to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/eu-iphone-app-sideloading-coming-2024/\">download apps hosted outside of Apple's official App Store</a> to comply with European regulations, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/federighi-sideloading.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nWriting in the latest subscriber edition of his Power On newsletter, Gurman said Apple will introduce a \"highly controlled system\" that lets EU users install apps hosted elsewhere. Apple also will reportedly alter Messages and payment apps as part of the changes, likely via a localized iOS 17 update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Black Friday Deals Available Now: AirPods, iPhone, iPad, and More</h2>\r<br />\nWe're less than a week away from Black Friday, but deals have been in full swing since October so we are firmly in holiday shopping season where you can get great deals across Apple products and accessories.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/best-early-black-friday-deals.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nWe're <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-black-friday-deals-available-now/\">keeping track of the best deals on Apple products and related accessories</a>, so be sure to check out our ongoing coverage throughout the rest of this month and into December.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>AI-Infused iOS 18 Lauded as 'Ambitious and Compelling' by Apple Execs</h2>\r<br />\nApple internally believes its iOS 18, macOS 15, watchOS 11, and tvOS 18 updates next year <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/apple-says-ios-18-ambitious-compelling/\">will be \"ambitious and compelling,\"</a> thanks to major new software features and designs in the works. That's according to the latest information relayed by <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nWhile little is known about the specifics, many of the changes are believed to involve generative AI, including a smarter version of Siri that takes the virtual assistant's integration with the operating systems to a new level.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>watchOS 10.2 Beta Reintroduces Option to Change Apple Watch Faces With a Swipe</h2>\r<br />\nAs part of Apple's revamp of the Apple Watch interface with watchOS 10, the company did away with the ability to quickly change watch faces with a simple swipe.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-watch-ultra-pink.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nWhile some users were relieved to no longer find themselves accidentally changing faces, others have been upset that changing faces now requires multiple steps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the latest watchOS 10.2 beta seeded this week, Apple is seeking to satisfy both groups, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/15/watchos-10-2-watch-face-swipe-change/\">bringing back the swipe gesture to change watch faces</a> but making it an optional setting. watchOS 10.2 is expected to see a public release next month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/nov-16-2023\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/18/top-stories-apple-rcs-support/\">Top Stories: Apple to Support RCS, iPhone 16 Rumors, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-apple-to-support-rcs-iphone-16-rumors-and-more.2411356/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"52c88c1bb4afced73fbb246c64b9c0c8d6662033e0022c0acf2ec311d60a1508","category":"Apple"}
