The versions with screens cost $47 for a 120 mm version and $52 for a 140 mm version, and TL fans without screens go for $33 and $36, respectively. The fans need to be connected to their own dedicated fan controller, which can drive up to seven of the LCD-equipped fans at a time. The screens can then be customized via proprietary software, as is unfortunately common for RGB lights and mini-screens.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992311#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992311&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"df386b7e6092d40bcabaf06630f2895ce686e20f6fa89d01f9ab276fb77b9eb4","category":"Tech"}
