This article will keep track of what’s being reported, as well as offer a perspective based on Apple’s current lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>MacBook Pro M4: Release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has yet to make a big impression in the AI market, which is sizzling hot right now. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2302124/apple-plans-to-go-big-with-ai-and-m4-mac-processors-starting-later-this-year.html\">Apple wants to make a big splash with the M4 chip</a>, which will have big AI enhancements and Apple wants to release the M4 as soon as possible. Gurman states that Apple plans to release M4 MacBook Pro models later this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple could ship in the fall of 2024, which would be about a year after the M3-series MacBook Pro was released. Gurman warns that the plans could change–whether he meant they could ship earlier or later, he doesn’t say.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>MacBook Pro M4: Design and Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The M4 upgrade would be the fourth generation of this particular MacBook Pro design. Apple isn’t expected to change it at all, so the 2024 release will likely be a chip upgrade only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M4 could change its memory configuration, though. Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2302124/apple-plans-to-go-big-with-ai-and-m4-mac-processors-starting-later-this-year.html\">reported</a> in April that Apple may increase the upper memory limit of its high-end desktop Macs. He didn’t say anything about MacBooks, but it’s not a reach to conclude that the M4 and its enhanced AI capabilities could lead to more RAM on the chip for MacBooks, too. However, design constraints could prevent the MacBooks from having an upper limit increase as big as on desktop Macs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another feature that could change is battery life. The M4 could be more efficient, or it could be more power-hungry, affecting battery life. Reports about the M4’s power consumption have yet to be made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple could offer a new color. With the M3 Pro/Max release, Apple introduced Space Black, which replaced Space Gray, with the other color option being Silver. The base M3 MacBook Pro is available in Space Gray or Silver, not Space Black.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"space black macbook pro\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?resize=1536%2C1023&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>Space Black made its debut with the M3 Pro/Max MacBook Pro last fall.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"space black macbook pro\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?resize=1536%2C1023&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Space Black made its debut with the M3 Pro/Max MacBook Pro last fall.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"space black macbook pro\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?resize=1536%2C1023&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-back-angle.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Space Black made its debut with the M3 Pro/Max MacBook Pro last fall.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple increased the display brightness from 500 to 600 nits with the M3 MacBook Pro, so this probably won’t change with the M4.
