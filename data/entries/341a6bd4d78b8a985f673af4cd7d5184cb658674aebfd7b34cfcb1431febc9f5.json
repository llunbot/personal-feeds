But that turns out to be more complicated than it might seem. Humans have a large package of behavioral traits that we lump together as intelligence, while many other creatures only have a limited subset of those traits. Some aspects of intelligence appear in species widely scattered across the evolutionary tree, ranging from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/03/cuttlefish-can-pass-the-marshmallow-test/\">cuttlefish</a> to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/giraffes-despite-a-relatively-small-brain-can-handle-statistics/\">giraffes</a>.</p>\n<p>Even in animals with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/09/for-the-first-time-research-reveals-crows-use-statistical-logic/\">widely acknowledged intellectual capacities</a> like birds, it can be difficult to understand whether evolution has directly shaped their intelligence or their smarts emerged as a side effect of something else that evolution selected for.</p>\n<p>A study released today complicates the picture a little further. It does persuasively show that the ability to learn complex new songs is associated with problem-solving in a large range of bird species. But it also shows that other things we associate with intelligence, like associative learning, seem completely unrelated.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968585#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968585&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"341a6bd4d78b8a985f673af4cd7d5184cb658674aebfd7b34cfcb1431febc9f5","category":"Tech"}
