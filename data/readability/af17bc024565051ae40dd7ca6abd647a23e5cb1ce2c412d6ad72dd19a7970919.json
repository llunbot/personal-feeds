Monte Grappa is a sacred place for many, including me. However, I didn’t discover it until I came here on a cycling trip with my Dad. We fuelled up with polenta, ate Asiago cheese for recovery, drank coffee in tiny bars, traded jokes in our ancient dialect and pedalled through some heavy rain. I crashed after my rental bike’s brakes failed, and still have the scars.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Baum-Corretto-Bikes-of-the-bunch-cyclingtips-17.jpg\"><figcaption>The Corretto at home in Monte Grappa.</figcaption></figure><p>I brought my Baum Orbis with me on the next trip. This was an all-rounder: could sprint, cruise for 250kms, and nail rollers. I battled up some 26% grades in straight (53/39) gearing, in a relatively laid back position on a bike that I’ve never weighed (but was probably over 7kgs). I tried my best to destroy myself on that bike, riding every day, in all conditions, with every group, up every climb. The bike never failed me but my mate’s brakes did while he was in front of me on a descent, and I ended up with a broken femur.</p><p>Sitting on the couch, dreaming about the mountains, I started designing a bike that belonged in Bassano del Grappa and would be made by Baum. The colours would pay homage to the Alpini soldiers. The name would be Frankie, after my great-grandfather Franceso, a very tall chap who was in the special Grenadiers division of the army.</p><p>The bike had to climb well. After spending six hours on the trainer in Geelong, trying five saddles, adjusting cleats for over an hour – talking about everything from artificial intelligence to fasting to Cadel Evans’ fixie-based training – Darren [Baum] and I settled on a design that was essentially like my Orbis but assuming that I would mostly be on grades &gt;10%. The gearing would assume that I had to get up grades &gt;20% after riding too much … or drinking too much grappa.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Baum-Corretto-Bikes-of-the-bunch-cyclingtips-11.jpg\"><figcaption>An 11-34T cassette awaits the Alps.</figcaption></figure><p>The groupset would be Campagnolo, of course, given that the company was started and remains here (among others: Castelli, Sportful, Selle Italia, Wilier, SiDi, Gaerne, Basso, Battaglin and many more). I was tempted to make this a ‘super light’ climbing bike by fitting it with THM/Lightweight/Extralite parts, maybe shaving off 500 grams. However, I know what it’s like to get stuck in a European country town: there are no disc brake pads with special compounds, mechanics to reset your SRAM Red, or glue for your singles. I also break stuff. I needed rim, mechanical, and doubles. Simple.</p><p>As it happens, Darren Baum named his rim-braked titanium bicycle the Corretto, among a line of coffee-inspired names (Ristretto, Cubano and Romano). The Bassanese drink a lot, you see: they take an Aperol spritz the minute the bar stops serving cappuccino at 10:30am (in the same seat). They follow with Prosecco (also from here) before lunch, Lugano (white wine) during lunch, a beer in the afternoon, and – when you need to push through that last block of work for the day – you take a caffé corretto. That is, coffee ‘corrected’ with grappa. Usually, you take a local (Nardini/Poli) or home-made grappa, and dump it into the coffee. However, one can also take the grappa before, after, alongside, or as a way to wash out the cup.</p><p>Finishing a ride on a Corretto, with a corretto, in Bassano: perfetto.</p><h2>Build </h2><p><strong>Frame:</strong> Baum Corretto Titanium<br><strong>Fork:</strong> Enve 2.0 50mm<br><strong>Headset:</strong> Chris King 1 1/8 Black SV<br><strong>Wheelset:</strong> Campagnolo Bora WTO 33<br><strong>Shifters:</strong> Campagnolo Super Record 12 speed<br><strong>Crankset:</strong> Campagnolo Super Record 12 speed<br><strong>Bottom bracket:</strong> Campagnolo Super Record 12 speed<br><strong>Front derailleur:</strong> Campagnolo Super Record 12 speed<br><strong>Rear derailleur:</strong> Campagnolo Super Record 12 speed<br><strong>Cassette:</strong> Campagnolo Super Record 12 speed 11-34<br><strong>Chain:</strong> Campagnolo Super Record 12 speed<br><strong>Brakes:</strong> Campagnolo Super Record 12 speed<br><strong>Tyres:</strong> Pirelli P Zero TLR SL 26mm<br><strong>Handlebar:</strong> 3T Superleggera Team Stealth 42cm<br><strong>Stem:</strong> 3T ARX 2 Team 120mm 31.8 6 degree<br><strong>Seatpost:</strong> Enve 5mm offset<br><strong>Cages:</strong> King Ti<br><strong>Bar tape:</strong> Silca Nastro Piloti Black<br><strong>Saddle:</strong> Prologo Zero ii Pas<br><strong>Pedals:</strong> Speedplay titanium<br></p><h2>Gallery</h2><figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Baum-Corretto-Bikes-of-the-bunch-cyclingtips-12.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Baum-Corretto-Bikes-of-the-bunch-cyclingtips-7-1340x754.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Baum-Corretto-Bikes-of-the-bunch-cyclingtips-2-1340x754.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Baum-Corretto-Bikes-of-the-bunch-cyclingtips-3-1340x754.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Baum-Corretto-Bikes-of-the-bunch-cyclingtips-4-1340x754.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Baum-Corretto-Bikes-of-the-bunch-cyclingtips-5-1340x754.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Baum-Corretto-Bikes-of-the-bunch-cyclingtips-6-1340x754.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Baum-Corretto-Bikes-of-the-bunch-cyclingtips-8.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Baum-Corretto-Bikes-of-the-bunch-cyclingtips-9.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Baum-Corretto-Bikes-of-the-bunch-cyclingtips-10.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Baum-Corretto-Bikes-of-the-bunch-cyclingtips-11.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Baum-Corretto-Bikes-of-the-bunch-cyclingtips-13.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Baum-Corretto-Bikes-of-the-bunch-cyclingtips-14.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Baum-Corretto-Bikes-of-the-bunch-cyclingtips-15.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Baum-Corretto-Bikes-of-the-bunch-cyclingtips-16.jpg\"></figure></li></ul></figure></div></div>","author":"CyclingTips","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"af17bc024565051ae40dd7ca6abd647a23e5cb1ce2c412d6ad72dd19a7970919","category":"Cycling"}
