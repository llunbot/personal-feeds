The increase in cost will improve Apple's average ‌iPhone‌ selling price, but it could put the device out of range of some customers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is Apple's new pricing lineup, with the ‌iPhone 16e‌ included:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li>‌iPhone 16e‌ - Starting at $599</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> - Starting at $699</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>‌iPhone 15‌ Plus - Starting at $799</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> - Starting at $799</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>‌iPhone 16‌ Plus - Starting at $899</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> - Starting at $999</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max - Starting at $1,199</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 16e‌ is available for pre-order on Friday, with a launch to follow on February 28.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e\">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/iphone-lineup-599-starting-price/\">Apple's Cheapest iPhone Now Starts at $599</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-cheapest-iphone-now-starts-at-599.2449711/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0d5c46ba403563a22d31909850b646825c5d8245028ebda2e9ad8f6ce6be4d1b","category":"Apple"}
