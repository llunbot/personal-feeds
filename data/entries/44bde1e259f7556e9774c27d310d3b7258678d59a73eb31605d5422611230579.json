{"title":"Kuo: AirPods Pro With USB-C Charging Case to Launch Later This Year","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/24/airpods-pro-2-usb-c-later-this-year/","date":1679662898000,"content":"Apple plans to release second-generation AirPods Pro with a USB-C charging case later this year, with mass shipments expected to begin in the second to third quarter, according to information shared today by Apple industry analyst <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1639249902483173376\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/airpods-pro-2.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe second-generation AirPods Pro launched in September 2022 with a Lightning charging case. The updated version of the second-generation AirPods Pro would have a USB-C charging case instead, but it's unclear if any other hardware changes are planned. Kuo believes references to new AirPods <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/21/ios-16-4-airpods-reference/\">discovered in the iOS 16.4 Release Candidate</a> earlier this week are related to the USB-C version of the AirPods Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAround two years after the original AirPods Pro launched, Apple started selling the headphones with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/airpods-pro-magsafe-charging-case/\">MagSafe-compatible charging case</a>, so there is precedent for a mid-cycle charging case update. Unfortunately, the MagSafe case was not sold on a standalone basis, and it's unclear if the USB-C case will be sold separately.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current version of the AirPods Pro charging case features a built-in speaker that can play a sound when the case is misplaced, an opening to attach a lanyard, a U1 chip for Find My support, and newly added compatibility with the Apple Watch charger.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll four iPhone 15 models coming later this year are expected to be equipped with a USB-C port, so it makes sense for the AirPods Pro charging case to switch to USB-C as well.  Apple already <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/apple-tv-remote-usb-c-port/\">switched the Apple TV's Siri Remote from Lightning to USB-C</a> last year and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/15/kuo-usb-c-apple-accessories/\">other accessories like the MagSafe Battery Pack</a> are rumored to follow eventually.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/24/apple-not-planning-usb-c-version-of-airpods-3/\">added</a> that Apple currently has no plans to release USB-C charging cases for the second-generation or third-generation AirPods. This suggests the standard AirPods may not have a USB-C charging case until a fourth-generation pair are released. Apple released the third-generation AirPods in October 2021.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/24/airpods-pro-2-usb-c-later-this-year/\">Kuo: AirPods Pro With USB-C Charging Case to Launch Later This Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-airpods-pro-with-usb-c-charging-case-to-launch-later-this-year.2384642/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"44bde1e259f7556e9774c27d310d3b7258678d59a73eb31605d5422611230579","category":"Apple"}
