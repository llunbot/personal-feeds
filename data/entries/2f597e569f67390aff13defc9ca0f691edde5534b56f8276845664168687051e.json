Here are some of the highlights of the region’s cycling landscape, key cycling events for amateur and pro cyclists alike, and places to visit and stay on your travels.</span></p>\n<h3><span>The cycling landscape</span></h3>\n<p><span>With year-round temperate weather, diverse terrain and beautiful scenery, the Costa Brava and Girona Pyrenees region provides a stunning backdrop for the cycling enthusiast. In just one ride you can explore vastly different landscapes, with culturally rich medieval Mediterranean towns nestled between quiet coves, imposing volcanoes and high-mountain passes in the Pyrenees.</span></p>\n<p><span>Whatever your discipline and ability – road racer, casual cyclist or intrepid mountain biker – there’s a route for you. For a stunning coastal ride, where you can take in views of the breathtaking blue Mediterranean, you have the road route from Lloret-Tossa de Mar to Sant Feliu de Guíxols. For traffic-free cycling, there are more than 140 kilometres of greenways, passing through around thirty towns in the region.</span></p>\n<p><span><br />\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/09/copia-de-copia-de-arxiu-ptcbg-cbatista-_-sans-25.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p></p></span></p>\n<p><span>These were once the train tracks that connected towns and industries in the Costa Brava and Girona Pyrenees. There’s plenty to offer by way of gravel riding too. The Pirinexus cycle loop spans 353 kilometres of greenways, rural tracks and quiet local roads, taking you through the Spanish and French Pyrenees in the Catalan region.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Girona’s cycling culture </span></h3>\n<p><span>Girona has fast become one of the cycling capitals of the world. It’s a unique setting for bicycle aficionados that pairs the authenticity of local culture and historical roads, squares and alleyways to explore with a growing cycling community and sporting atmosphere. In many ways, enthusiast cycling culture and Girona’s local culture are inseparable, with many pro cyclists, including David Millar, Hannah and Alice Barnes and Kasia Niewiadoma, training in and making Girona their home, and many locals being brought up with a passion for cycling. </span></p>\n<p><span>One of the most famous and much-loved aspects of Girona’s cycling culture is its abundance of cycling cafes, many of which are run by professional cyclists from around the world. For example, specialty coffee shop La Fábrica and Girona's only in-house coffee roastery, Espresso Mafia, were set up by former pro-cyclist Christian Meier and his wife Amber. Federal Café in Girona’s old town is owned by Australian former professional road racer Rory Sutherland, and Hors Catégorie is owned by Dutch cyclist Robert Gesink. The La Comuna cafe and hotel is run by the triathlete couple Emma and Jan Frodeno, who both won triathlon gold medals at the Beijing 2008 Olympics.</span></p>\n<p><span><br />\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n          </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p></p></span></p>\n<h3><span>Key cycling events around the Costa Brava</span></h3>\n<p><span>Whether you’re a pro or amateur enthusiast, you won’t be disappointed by the cycling events the Costa Brava region has to offer.
