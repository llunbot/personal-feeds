Well, the small team that runs Camp and Go Slow used to have a pair of Great Horned Owls nesting in a tree near their place. After a tragic and devastating wildfire ripped through their area, the owls had found somewhere else to nest. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Campandgoslow-New-Owl-Tape-non-drive.webp\"><img width=\"1080\" height=\"566\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Campandgoslow-New-Owl-Tape-non-drive.webp\" alt=\"Campandgoslow New Owl Tape non-drive\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Campandgoslow-New-Owl-Tape-non-drive.webp 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Campandgoslow-New-Owl-Tape-non-drive-297x156.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Campandgoslow-New-Owl-Tape-non-drive-120x63.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Campandgoslow-New-Owl-Tape-non-drive-768x402.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Campandgoslow-New-Owl-Tape-stargazer.webp\"><img width=\"1080\" height=\"566\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Campandgoslow-New-Owl-Tape-stargazer.webp\" alt=\"Campandgoslow New Owl Tape stargazer\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Campandgoslow-New-Owl-Tape-stargazer.webp 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Campandgoslow-New-Owl-Tape-stargazer-297x156.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Campandgoslow-New-Owl-Tape-stargazer-120x63.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Campandgoslow-New-Owl-Tape-stargazer-768x402.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After four years, the owls returned to nest nearby. Casey decided that he would pay homage to these magnificent creatures, one of the best ways he knows how… with its very own signature bar tape. Now, joining the team with the Western and Eastern Rattlers, and the Brown Trout, this new tape fits right in! </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Campandgoslow-New-Owl-Tape-Four-Tapes.webp\"><img width=\"1080\" height=\"566\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Campandgoslow-New-Owl-Tape-Four-Tapes.webp\" alt=\"Campandgoslow New Owl Tape Four Tapes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Campandgoslow-New-Owl-Tape-Four-Tapes.webp 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Campandgoslow-New-Owl-Tape-Four-Tapes-297x156.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Campandgoslow-New-Owl-Tape-Four-Tapes-120x63.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Campandgoslow-New-Owl-Tape-Four-Tapes-768x402.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Here’s the full collection of tapes.
