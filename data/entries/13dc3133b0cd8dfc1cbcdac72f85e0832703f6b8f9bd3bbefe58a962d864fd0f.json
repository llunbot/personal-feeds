{"title":"Dithering Today: A Preview of Spatial Video on Vision Pro","link":"https://dithering.fm/","date":1699639221000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://dithering.fm/\">\n<img src=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/11/dithering-cover-nov-2023.jpeg\" alt=\"November 2023 cover art for Dithering, depicting a family in silhouette, holdings umbrellas, crossing the street on a rainy fall day.\" width=\"500\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>New episodes usually drop at the crack of dawn, but today’s Dithering was held until 10am PT/1pm ET due to an embargo. Yesterday I got hands-on experience shooting spatial video using an iPhone 15 Pro and watching those videos that I shot — along with others, recorded by Apple — on a Vision Pro headset. I’m blown away once again. I’ll have a column describing my experience out later this afternoon, but Dithering subscribers can hear my thoughts now.</p>\n\n<p>Dithering as a standalone subscription costs just $5/month or $50/year. You get two episodes per week, each exactly 15 minutes long. You can also get it as part of my co-host Ben Thompson’s Stratechery Plus bundle — a veritable steal at just $12/month or $120/year. I just love having an outlet like Dithering for weeks like this one. People who try Dithering seem to love it, too — we have remarkably little churn.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/10/dithering-spatial-video\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"13dc3133b0cd8dfc1cbcdac72f85e0832703f6b8f9bd3bbefe58a962d864fd0f","category":"Tech"}
