SPD-compatible Velosamba Cycling Shoes.</p>\n<p>The Velosamba Cold.Rdy shoes are designed for cold-weather commuting and use a new construction that sees 50 per cent recycled plastic used in the upper material.</p>\n<p>Alongside the Velosamba Cold.Rdy, Adidas has also released The Cold.Rdy Cycling Jacket, which joins the padded Cold.Rdy Cycling Bib Tights in the brand’s winter-cycling range.</p>\n<p>Adidas only re-entered the cycling market two years ago after a 15-year hiatus.</p>\n<h2>Cold-weather classics</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

Cold.Rdy isn’t quite as casual as the regular <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/adidas-samba/\">Velosamba</a>, but the soul of Adidas’ Classic Samba shoe can still be seen in its design.</p>\n<p>Adidas says this insulated version extends your comfort zone in cold weather, while still retaining the Samba style.</p>\n<p>To increase pedalling efficiency, Adidas has given the Velosamba Cold.Rdy a nylon and glass fibre plate midsole.</p>\n<p>The brand says the midsole still has some flex to aid in comfortable walking, which should enable you to continue to wear the Velosamba Cold.Rdy when you’re off the bike.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\"

shoe is the cleat box on the sole.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Adidas</i></span></div>\n<p>The sole features a two-bolt cleat mount, which allows for <a

visibility.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Adidas</i></span></div>\n<p>Adidas has also included more reflective accents than the regular Velosamba, with the outer of the shoes and the brand’s iconic three stripes using a reflective material to help with low-light visibility when <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/cycling-at-night/\">riding at night</a>.</p>\n<p>Laces and chainrings aren’t always the best combination, but Adidas has included an elastic bungee to prevent loose ends drifting into the drivetrain.</p>\n<p>The Velosamba Cold.Rdy is only available in black and can be purchased through Adidas’ website for £130/$170/€150.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a
