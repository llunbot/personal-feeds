Scanning is free across iOS, iTunes backups (if you’re still using those), and iCloud data, but recovery is limited to three instances on the free plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>FoneLab’s premium version will allow a user to recover data from any of the above, as well as a ‘Fix iOS system’ option that could potentially help you brick a device (that could be a handy safety net if you’re still jailbreaking your iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also covers a whole host of messaging services, including regular suspects like Messenger and WhatsApp, as well as Viber, Kik, Line, and WeChat, and does so for around $70 for a lifetime license.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That one license covers you for 1 Mac and 6 mobile devices, and it’s a much better value than paying $50 per month for 1 Mac and 1 device with the monthly license. See the other Mac data recovery apps we’;’ve tested in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668874/best-data-recovery-apps-for-mac.html\">Best Mac data recovery app round-up</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s perhaps not quite as full-featured with things like duplicate detection offered by <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2390220/disk-drill-pro-review.html\">Disk Drill (reviewed here)</a>, but it remains an affordable option that can cover a family’s devices for a relatively affordable fee – and that’s before discounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>First Impressions</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Free-vs-Premium.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Free vs Premium\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Free-vs-Premium.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 776w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Free-vs-Premium.jpeg?resize=300%2C269&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Free-vs-Premium.jpeg?resize=768%2C688&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"776\" height=\"695\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Free vs Premium – FoneLab makes it clear what you’re paying for right off the bat.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you boot up the Mac version of FoneLab for the first time, it instantly explains what you can gain from the premium version. I appreciate that transparency instead of waiting for users to muddle through themselves and find what’s paywalled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no real friction with the app, either – you plug in your phone, enter your passcode, and hit ‘Scan’. Scanning is faster than some rivals, but analyzing that data takes a little longer – expect to see plenty of thumbnails that can’t be opened just yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, it’s nice to look at, with a clear sidebar full of filters and a main window that packs a whole host of previews so you can easily pick what it is you need to recover.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>FoneLab features</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Image-Recovery.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Image Recovery\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Image-Recovery.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1108w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Image-Recovery.jpeg?resize=300%2C180&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Image-Recovery.jpeg?resize=768%2C460&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"614\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Image Recovery: Scanning doesn’t take too long, but recovery takes longer.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>While some options offer a multitude of features like a data recovery Swiss Army Knife, FoneLab is much more focused on just doing the recovery part well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned above, that might be what makes it a little faster than some other recovery tools we’ve reviewed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It meant that within around 45 minutes I could see a whole host of images I thought were lost to time, including deleted product shots from old reviews and duplicate pet photos. It can restore from iCloud backups, too, which is handy if your device is lost or stolen.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scanning.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Scanning\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scanning.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1228w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scanning.jpeg?resize=300%2C171&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scanning.jpeg?resize=768%2C437&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scanning.jpeg?resize=1200%2C683&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Scanning: FoneLab is a polished app to look at.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The iOS System Recovery tool could be helpful if you’ve inadvertently bricked your phone, too, while the option to back up and restore your phone locally is handy, but also something offered by Apple’s own toolkit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, WhatsApp transfer is very welcome for anyone fed up of the lengthy process of switching between phones and having your data from the messaging app come with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also worth noting that there’s a Windows version of the app, too, so you’re not restricted to using just an Apple computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>FoneLab annoyances</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/iOS-System-Recovery.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iOS System Recovery\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/iOS-System-Recovery.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1127w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/iOS-System-Recovery.jpeg?resize=300%2C176&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/iOS-System-Recovery.jpeg?resize=768%2C450&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>iOS System Recovery: FoneLab could fix a ‘bricked’ iPhone.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I tested FoneLab on an M3 MacBook Air with 24GB of RAM, and sadly ran into a couple of occasions per scan where performance would slow to a crawl. Thankfully it picked up again and I didn’t need to abort the process, but if you’re running it on an older Mac you may struggle to get it to play along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the subject of varying from device to device, it’s worth noting that some reviews have suggested FoneLab was less useful for recovering certain data types. I can only review based on my experience, but there are enough mentions of the lack of photo recoveries to make it worth pointing out here.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy FoneLab?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A solid recovery option lacking in bells and whistles you’ll find elsewhere, FoneLab is a relatively affordable option that feels ideal for families with multiple devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e4d2d319f41e08a0451fd1267d1b3acdb6b9331e9984c61b72b3632bde22278d","category":"Apple"}
