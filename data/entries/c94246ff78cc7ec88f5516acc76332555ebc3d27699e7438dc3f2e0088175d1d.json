Thanks to the switch to OLED, Apple is reportedly going to trim some 20 percent from the thickness of the device, making it one of the thinnest devices Apple has ever made:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>11-inch iPad Pro (2022):</strong> 247.6 mm x 178.5 mm x 5.9 mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>11-inch iPad Pro (2024):</strong> 249.7 mm x 177.5 mm x 5.1 mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>12.9-inch iPad Pro (2022):</strong> 280.6 mm x 214.9 mm x 6.4 mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>12.9-inch iPad Pro (2024):</strong> 281.5 mm x 215.5 mm x 5.0 mm</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The site also confirms reports that Apple will release a new 12.9-inch iPad Air with similar dimensions to the existing iPad Pro. That would make the iPad Air and iPad Pro lines identical in size but differentiated by features and specs like the standard and Pro iPhones. The main differences between the lines will likely be the processor (M2 vs M3), display tech (LED vs OLED), and biometrics (Touch ID vs Face ID). The iPad Pro will also likely still have higher storage options, better cameras, and faster data transfers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/14-inch-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">new iPad Pro</a> is also rumored to get a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2096970/ipad-mini-air-pro-rumors-specs-processor-upgrades.html\">new Magic Keyboard accessory</a> with a redesigned aluminum body and a larger trackpad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/when-is-apples-next-event.html\">Apple’s spring event</a> is expected to be held next month and will likely include new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2000691/13-15-inch-macbook-air-m3-release-date-specs-rumors-html.html\">M3 MacBook Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2109165/m3-mac-mini-design-processor-specs-release-rumors.html\">Mac mini</a> along with the new iPads (potentially a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110304/ipad-air-2024-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html\">new iPad Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/ipad-mini-7-specs-design-processor-release.html\">iPad mini</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2158175/ipad-11th-gen-2024-release-date.html\">11th gen iPad</a>). Apple could also unveil the M3 Ultra chip for the Mac Studio and Mac Pro as well as a new mid-cycle iPhone color.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c94246ff78cc7ec88f5516acc76332555ebc3d27699e7438dc3f2e0088175d1d","category":"Apple"}
