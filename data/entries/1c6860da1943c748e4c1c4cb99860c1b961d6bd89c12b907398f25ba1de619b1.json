{"title":"Jessica Lessin’s 2014 Profile of Kim Vorrath","link":"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-s-software-taskmaster-faces-tough-test?rc=jfy0lk","date":1737768469000,"content":"\n<p>Jessica Lessin, writing for The Information back in 2014:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ms. Vorrath, who has worked on all seven iOS releases, generally\noperates by asking lots of questions of engineers, sticking to the\nfacts and getting them to explain in plain English why a\nparticular feature should be included in the operating system.\nShe’s easy to get along with, say former colleagues, who recall\nplayfully mocking her 1990s feathered hairstyle and late 1980s\nfashion sense. But she isn’t known for chitchat and has been known\nto “blow up” on occasion when people miss deadlines or make\nexcuses, colleagues say.</p>\n\n<p>During a tense time before the first release of iOS software in\n2007, Ms. Vorrath grew irate when a colleague was heading home\nearly before another marathon weekend meeting. She slammed her\noffice door so hard that the door knob broke, and she locked\nherself in. Mr. Forstall grabbed a baseball bat to try to break\nher out, people who worked at Apple at the time recall. Mr.\nForstall didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My understanding is that Forstall <em>did</em> break her out, smashing the doorknob off with the bat. Every good software team needs a baseball bat.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/24/lessin-vorrath\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1c6860da1943c748e4c1c4cb99860c1b961d6bd89c12b907398f25ba1de619b1","category":"Tech"}
