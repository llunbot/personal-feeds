{"title":"Apple's 27-Inch 'iMac Pro' With Mini-LED Display Expected in Spring 2022","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/apple-imac-pro-spring-2022/","date":1639424444000,"content":"Apple's next-generation larger-screened \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> Pro\" is expected to launch next spring, according to a <a href=\"https://www.displaysupplychain.com/blog/what-will-the-big-display-stories-be-in-2022\">forward looking article</a> on Apple's upcoming devices penned by display analyst Ross Young.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/2020-iMac-Mockup-Feature-teal.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nYoung says that the new ‌iMac‌ is \"expected in the spring,\" with spring in the Northern Hemisphere starting on March 20 and ending on June 21. Apple often holds an event in the spring, so we could perhaps see the new ‌iMac‌ come out at the annual spring event.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere were rumors of an ‌iMac‌ with a display larger than 27 inches, but more recent information, including details from Young, have pointed toward Apple maintaining the 27-inch display size. The device will use a mini-LED display similar to the MacBook Pro, and it will feature support for 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo simplify its naming strategy, the new ‌iMac‌ could be called the \"‌iMac‌ Pro,\" which would differentiate it from the 24-inch ‌iMac‌ and put it on par with the MacBook Pro machines. The new 27-inch iMacs are expected to use the same <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-pro/\">M1 Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-max/\">M1 Max</a> chips as the 2021 MacBook Pro models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere have been rumors about Apple transitioning to OLED displays for some Macs and iPads instead of mini-LED, and Young also touches on that subject in his analysis. Young believes that we shouldn't expect an OLED <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> or MacBook until 2023 at the earliest.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRight now, prices for Apple's mini-LED panels are more expensive than similar OLED panels, but the adoption of OLED vs. the continued adoption of mini-LED will depend on how fast mini-LED prices drop. Young says that pricing differences \"will be critical\" in the \"OLED vs. mini-LED battle.\"<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/\">Ross Young</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2022-imac-pro/\">2022 iMac Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/apple-imac-pro-spring-2022/\">Apple's 27-Inch 'iMac Pro' With Mini-LED Display Expected in Spring 2022</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-27-inch-imac-pro-with-mini-led-display-expected-in-spring-2022.2327348/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kz2LzTxtp80:BS_M6a24L8Y:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kz2LzTxtp80:BS_M6a24L8Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7852d130cd12f946696bd2122801f63a192858ae1bb60671617d8a3be179f8db","category":"Apple"}
