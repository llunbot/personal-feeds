Meh.com does the daily deal thing, sells cool shit for cheap, and they keep it simple. One thing a day — just go there and see what’s up now. They’ll have something different tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>They also have a sharp logo that looks great on the DF background color, and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2021/10/fucking_mehcom\">they write really funny sponsored entries</a> for the RSS feed. I sincerely recommend you check them out.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/17/meh\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2aedc1148c54e97f4acf0592ae9c8cb6b679e984ff77c662d520afdb10f0b878","category":"Tech"}
