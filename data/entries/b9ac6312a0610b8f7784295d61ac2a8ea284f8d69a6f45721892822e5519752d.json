There are so many leaks.</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, Carphone Warehouse posted an <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20211009124610/https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/google/pixel6-river-content.html\">official-looking teaser</a> site (it has since been taken down) for the Pixel 6.

Google isn't designing any custom CPU or GPU cores, (though it is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/shocking-pixel-6-rumor-lists-google-soc-with-two-arm-x1-cpu-cores/\">getting creative</a> with the configuration) and has only alluded to a small handful of AI use-cases as selling points of the SoC.</p>\n<p>We've <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/new-reports-say-the-pixel-6-will-feature-a-custom-google-whitechapel-soc/\">long speculated</a> that Google's chip plans are really about extending Android's support time, allowing the company to better compete with Apple, and now we finally have confirmation of that. Apple is up to <a href=\"https://www.igeeksblog.com/how-long-apple-supports-iphones-infographic/\">seven years</a> of support on the iPhone 6s, by the way.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802975#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802975&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b9ac6312a0610b8f7784295d61ac2a8ea284f8d69a6f45721892822e5519752d","category":"Tech"}
