That time, however, Faulkner miscalculated somewhat, her tempo proving too much even for herself and she dropped back once Gaia Realini and Elisa Longo Borghini took charge of the pace. </span></p>\n<p><span>The 30-year-old was not originally set to race in Tuscany last weekend but was down as a reserve, and was called in last-minute fresh off a holiday in Thailand that she took post-UAE Tour. </span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1471185199.jpeg?width=730\" alt width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /><figcaption><span>SIENA, ITALY – MARCH 04: (L-R) Lotte Kopecky of Belgium and Team SD Worx on second place, race winner Demi Vollering of The Netherlands and Team SD Worx and Kristen Faulkner of The United States and Team Jayco-Alula on third place pose on the podium ceremony after the Eroica – 9th Strade Bianche 2023, Women’s a 136km one day race from Siena to Siena 318m / #StradeBianche / on March 04, 2023 in Siena, Italy.

The pair worked together to build a gap of a minute and a half before Faulkner left her breakaway companion behind with 32 km to go. </span></p>\n<p><span>By the time she reached the sixth sector, Pieve a Salti, Faulkner had extended her lead to almost two minutes. Each time the camera panned to the American, her jersey and shorts ripped and bloodied from her earlier crash, she looked composed, controlling her effort well while the group behind attacked each other.</span></p>\n<p><span>Once the SD Worx duo of Kopecky and Vollering got themselves organised to chase the Jayco-AlUla rider her gap began to plummet, but Faulkner went down swinging. She chipped away, maintaining her gap all the way to the bottom of the Via Santa Caterina climb but, excruciatingly, was caught with 700m to go – although not before a moment of standing her ground to Demi Vollering, who she forced into the barriers. </span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1471176838.jpeg?width=730\" alt width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /><figcaption><span>SIENA, ITALY – MARCH 04: Kristen Faulkner of The United States and Team Jayco-Alula crosses the finish line during the Eroica – 9th Strade Bianche 2023, Women’s a 136km one day race from Siena to Siena 318m / #StradeBianche / on March 04, 2023 in Siena, Italy.

An undeniably talented rider but also a fiercely determined one, as evidenced by her aggressive racing but also her ability to pick herself up and carry on – she finished the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/tag/tour-de-france-femmes-avec-zwift/\">Tour de France Femmes</a> covered almost head-to-toe in bandages.  </span></p>\n<p><span>She may not be the most technically or tactically astute rider, but Faulkner has guts when it comes to making a big move, and the legs to back it up. Whether it pays off or not, her strength and determination deserve to be applauded. </span></p>","author":"Amy Jones","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"fd09d7391cecdf580ba476be83fd4500f1b20042745a156833ad88d5a59ce235","category":"Cycling"}
