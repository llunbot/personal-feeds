Alexa will be able to hold complex, context-aware conversations with users, and will be able to handle multi-faceted requests.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAmazon is using AI models from Anthropic's Claude rather than relying solely on its in-house AI technology, as early versions of Amazon AI had trouble responding in a timely manner. Amazon initially planned to roll out the updated version of Alexa last year, but ended up pushing the debut back.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is important for Amazon to get changes to Alexa right, because there are more than 100 million active Alexa users and over 500 million Alexa-enabled devices have been sold. Amazon is aiming to convert some of those Alexa users into paying customers, with plans to eventually charge a subscription fee for the new Alexa. At launch, Amazon will test the new Alexa with a small number of users and won't charge for it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new version of Amazon Alexa will come just ahead of when we are expecting Apple to begin testing a new iteration of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> that's equipped with new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> capabilities. Apple says that ‌Siri‌ is going to be updated with on-screen awareness, personal context, and the ability to do more in and with apps, all of which are expected to allow ‌Siri‌ to do more for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and Mac users.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNext year, rumors suggest Apple will roll out an updated version of ‌Siri‌ trained using large language models, so ‌Siri‌ will be able to better compete with ChatGPT and chatbots.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/alexa/\">Alexa</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/amazon/\">Amazon</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/05/alexa-ai-coming-february/\">Amazon Plans to Unveil Next-Generation Alexa AI Later This Month</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/amazon-plans-to-unveil-next-generation-alexa-ai-later-this-month.2448849/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a94e010d1a212f201a15db4a3de65eefc2c962a02ff8deba9bf5c970726e6a53","category":"Apple"}
