The company plans to sell it, and you can sign up for more information, though pricing and availability have yet to be determined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Atomic Keyboard is hard at work on the project. This week, they’ve released a couple of videos where you can see the keyboard up close. The first video was posted several days ago and shows the keyboard layout and someone using the keys and trackball. Turn on the volume, and you can hear the key switches in action.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The second video posted on Wednesday, and it’s from Atomic Keyboard’s booth at the <a href=\"https://zfx.zfrontier.com/\">ZFX Shanghai Keyboard Meetup</a> (TIL: people gather at events <em>specifically for keyboards</em>). You can get another close look at the product and see people using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If those two videos have captured your interest, you can let Atomic Keyboard know by filling out the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc1R9zB0S57U7scq-2RQABci_eM93eZxQvQTKhuyIimSgKBcw/viewform\">MDR Dasher Keyboard Interest Check form</a>. Atomic Keyboard wants your input (excuse the pun) on what features the MDR Dasher should have. For example, should it be wired or wireless&gt; Do you want the <em>Severance</em> key layout (and stay true to the show), or a Standard layout (and actually be able to do work)? It’s a two-minute form, so if you truly want this, fill it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting thing revealed by the form is somewhat vague pricing information. While the price has yet to be finalized, the form states that “the early bird price will be no more than $399 (with tiered pricing up to $699).” No more than $399? Yikes, even under that, it’s an expensive keyboard. To top it off, the form states that the whole <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2660512/president-trump-us-tariffs-impact-apple-products-price.html\">tariff drama</a> could affect the price, since the keyboard will be made in China.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Atomic Keyboard, the MDR Dasher Keyboard is inspired by the<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.pdp-11.nl/dg/d200/dasher200.html&amp;xcust=1-1-2688687-1-0-0-0-0-01JT3R09JB2C1CQGYP493569JR&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/2688687/praise-kier-the-severance-keyboard-is-coming-to-the-mac.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Data General Dasher 200</a>, a computer terminal from the 1970s. Atomic Keyboard originally posted that the MDR Dasher “boasts a unique 73-key, 70% layout with no Escape, no Control, and no Options keys” but that could change if enough people tell the company that a Standard layout is preferable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MDR Dasher Keyboard will be available for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
