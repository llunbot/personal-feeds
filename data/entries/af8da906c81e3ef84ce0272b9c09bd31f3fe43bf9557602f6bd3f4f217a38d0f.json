But ARPGs live and die by their endgame loops, and it was far too early at the time to accurately assess the game’s true staying power.</p>\n<p>Sadly, after that confident first step, like so many loot-hunting games before it, <em>Diablo IV</em> fell flat on its face. I’ve seen plenty of boneheaded updates to live-service games, but <em>Diablo IV</em>’s first major patch, released a couple of months after the game’s release, was still pretty shocking. By that point, a consensus had emerged that the endgame was a bit barren, and getting to the game’s level cap of 100 was a tedious slog. But that’s the great thing about live-service games, right? Tweak some numbers, throw in a couple of fun high-level activities, and, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr2PlqXw03Y\" target=\"_blank\">baby, you’ve got a stew going</a>.</p>\n<p>Sadly, the game’s developers at Blizzard had other plans. The patch notes for that first update read like someone had systematically gone through the game and <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/23801426/diablo-4s-season-1-patch-1-1-nerfs-community-reaction\" target=\"_blank\">removed anything that could be considered fun</a>. Almost every character build had been mercilessly nerfed, and worst of all, the game became even slower. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1534z13/patch_11_is_essentially_a_slowdown_to_every/\" target=\"_blank\">Fans were incensed</a>, and <em>Diablo IV</em> floundered like this for its first three <a href=\"https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Season_(Diablo_IV)\">seasons</a>.
