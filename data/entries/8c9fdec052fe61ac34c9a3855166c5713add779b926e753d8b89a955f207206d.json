In a first, the rules would apply to old wells in addition to new ones, and the rules would introduce “a comprehensive monitoring program to require companies to find and fix leaks,” the EPA said. Altogether, the rules would trim the oil and gas sector’s methane leaks by 75 percent, the administration estimated.</p>\n<p>Leaks are rife throughout the industry, <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aar7204\">amounting</a> to 2.3 percent of all natural gas production in the US. Globally, leaks are responsible for just over 5 percent of all energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/driving-down-methane-leaks-from-the-oil-and-gas-industry\">according</a> to the International Energy Agency.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809626#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809626&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8c9fdec052fe61ac34c9a3855166c5713add779b926e753d8b89a955f207206d","category":"Tech"}
