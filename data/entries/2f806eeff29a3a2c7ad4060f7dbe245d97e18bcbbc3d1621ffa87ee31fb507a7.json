With a promised starting price of $39,900, the single-motor version ever so slightly <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/ford-reveals-pricing-for-the-f-150-lightning-pro-work-truck/\">undercut the cheapest version</a> of Ford's electric F-150 Lightning. Tesla increased the entry-level price by more than $20,000 by the time the Cybertruck was actually getting close to production, with promises of deliveries in 2025. But now, all mention of the cheaper rear-wheel drive Cybertruck is gone from Tesla's ordering page.</p>\n<p>Although pickup trucks have dominated new vehicle sales in the US for decades, their buyers are not exactly clamoring to swap their V8s or diesels for a slab of batteries and some electric motors. Ford has been finding that out the hard wayâ€”<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/07/ford-slashes-f-150-lightning-ev-prices-by-up-to-9979/\">a constant string of price changes</a> have helped keep demand depressed enough that the Blue Oval is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/fords-q1-ev-sales-grew-86-but-its-shifting-focus-to-hybrids/\">shifting its entire electric vehicle strategy</a> as a result.</p>\n<p>And the F-150 Lightning has the advantage of looking just like all the other F-150s that roll off the production line. Not so the Cybertruck, a vehicle that manages to look <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/11/the-tesla-cybertruck-finally-goes-on-sale-starting-at-60990/\">even less elegant</a> when you see one in the wild rather than on a screen.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042478#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042478&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
