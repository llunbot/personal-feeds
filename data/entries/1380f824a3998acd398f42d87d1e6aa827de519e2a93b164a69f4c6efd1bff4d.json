The second beta <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/apple-releases-visionos-beta-2/\">came out in July</a>, so it has been over a month since Apple released a ‌visionOS‌ update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Orange.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nA select number of developers have access to Vision Pro headsets at this time, with the headsets used for app testing purposes. Most people will not have access to the ‌visionOS‌ beta outside of Xcode, and it is not yet clear what Apple is adding in each ‌visionOS‌ update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is also allowing developers to attend Vision Pro labs around the world, and developers who visit these locations are able to test the Vision Pro in person and get help from Apple engineers on their ‌visionOS‌ apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Vision Pro headset is not expected until early 2024, so Apple still has a lot of work to do on both hardware and software. Reports from developers who have been able to test the headset have suggested that there are multiple unfinished features, such as an inability to use the front-facing display.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-releases-third-visionos-beta/\">Apple Releases Third visionOS Beta for Developers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-third-visionos-beta-for-developers.2399952/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1380f824a3998acd398f42d87d1e6aa827de519e2a93b164a69f4c6efd1bff4d","category":"Apple"}
