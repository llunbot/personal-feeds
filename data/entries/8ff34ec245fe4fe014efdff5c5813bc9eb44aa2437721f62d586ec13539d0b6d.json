As a client for OpenAI's language model family, the GPT-3.5 and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-announces-gpt-4-its-next-generation-ai-language-model/\">GPT-4</a> models run on the cloud and provide results to your Android device.

As an AI assistant, it can help with summarization, text composition, and analysis.
