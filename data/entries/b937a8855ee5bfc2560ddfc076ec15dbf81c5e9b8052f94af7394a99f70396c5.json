According to <em>The Verge</em>, the prototype speaker had a square shape, and it was similar to the look of Apple's now-discontinued <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe Battery Pack</a>, but thicker.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome employees thought the speaker product would resonate with Gen Z, and expected it to deliver good sound regardless of the compact size. Sonos ended up scrapping the project, though, due to \"technical limitations, questionable appeal, and a limited target market.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSonos has been working to expand its product lineup. Last year, Sonos introduced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/hands-on-sonos-ace-headphones/\">the Sonos Ace headphones</a> that compete with high-end headphones like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a>, and later this year, it is rumored to be planning to introduce a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/04/sonos-set-top-box/\">set-top box similar to the Apple TV</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonos/\">Sonos</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/06/sonos-iphone-magsafe-speaker-prototyped/\">Sonos Considered a MagSafe Speaker for iPhone, But Scrapped It</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sonos-considered-a-magsafe-speaker-for-iphone-but-scrapped-it.2448916/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b937a8855ee5bfc2560ddfc076ec15dbf81c5e9b8052f94af7394a99f70396c5","category":"Apple"}
