{"title":"Disney likely axed The Acolyte because of soaring costs","link":"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/10/the-acolytes-bloated-budget-contributed-to-its-axing/","date":1728416406000,"content":"<p>We had mixed feelings about <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/08/the-acolyte-canceled-no-season-2-star-wars-disney-plus-1236044233/\">the news</a> in August that Disney+ had cancelled its Star Wars spinoff series <em>The Acolyte</em> after just one season. At the time, it seemed steadily declining ratings <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/08/disney-cancels-the-acolyte-after-one-season/\">were to blame</a>, particularly given the high production costs. More <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinereid/2024/09/26/disney-reveals-star-wars-show-the-acolyte-was-over-budget-at-230-million/\">budgetary details</a> have trickled out since then, indicating that the streaming series spent far more than previously reported, topping $230.1 million—roughly $28.7 million per episode—before post-production had even been completed. That's significantly more than the original $180 million reported budget, or about $22.5 million per episode.</p>\n<p>The show received solid-to-lukewarm critical reviews, although a review-bombing campaign hurt the series' standing on Rotten Tomatoes among user reviews. As we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/08/disney-cancels-the-acolyte-after-one-season/\">previously noted</a>, from the start, <em>The Acolyte</em> was a bit of a departure from a typical Star Wars series, weaving in elements from <em>wuxia</em> films and detective stories while <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/06/star-wars-behind-the-scenes-creating-the-unique-aesthetic-of-the-acolyte/\">remaining true</a> to the established Star Wars aesthetic and design. That alone made it an intriguing effort, with fresh characters and new takes on classic Star Wars lore. And the martial arts-inspired fight choreography was clever and fun to watch—especially in the shocking, action-packed fifth episode (\"Night\").</p>\n<p>But there were some obvious shortcomings as well, most notably the clunky dialogue—although that's kind of a long-standing attribute of the Star Wars franchise. The pacing lagged at times, and there was a surprisingly high body count among the central characters. All these contributed to the lukewarm critical reviews.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/10/the-acolytes-bloated-budget-contributed-to-its-axing/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/10/the-acolytes-bloated-budget-contributed-to-its-axing/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"afc73dfa917168f69e8538af898e3c1d9ca20f12bfa38701c0239011ff00bc7d","category":"Tech"}
