As has been rumored for months, the race will start in Hungary next year for the first time in the Giro’s history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plans for Budapest to host the Grande Partenza have been in the works for quite some time as the Hungarian capital was originally slated to welcome the Giro in 2020 before those plans were scrapped due to the COVID-19 pandemic. That race instead started in Sicily with the 2021 edition getting underway from Turin. Next year will finally see the Giro roll out from Hungary after a two-year delay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The race will kick off with a mass start stage from Budapest to Visegrád. The opening stage runs 195 km in full and closes out with a fourth-category uphill finish. That opening stage will be followed by a 9.2 km individual time trial in Budapest which will also conclude with a fourth-category drag to the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Giro peloton will then close out its Hungarian sojourn with a 201 km stage from Kaposvár to Balatonfüred that looks likely to suit the sprinters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further details of the 2022 Giro route will be rolled out over the coming days.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/11/the-2022-giro-ditalia-will-start-with-three-stages-in-hungary/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"50514886233f223da2f156bc8ef948f623ce6ffbe3900739722d716463421100","category":"Cycling"}
