There are complaints from customers about this issue across the <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-9-flickering-when-raising-to-wake-on-10-0-2.2407076/\">MacRumors Forums</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/16y6ssa/apple_watch_ultra_2_screen_flickering/\">Reddit</a>, and the <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255165682\">Apple Support Community website</a>. The issue appears to be present on all watchOS 10 versions, including the latest watchOS 10.0.2 release.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says service providers should not repair affected watches, and instead advise customers to keep their Apple Watch software up to date, suggesting that Apple will eventually make a fix available in a watchOS update. It's unclear if Apple has addressed the issue in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/apple-seeds-watchos-10-1-rc/\">watchOS 10.1</a>, which is expected to be released to the public next week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs a temporary solution, Apple says customers can turn off Always On mode in the Settings app under Display &amp; Brightness â†’ Always On.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Watch-Pink-Complications.jpg\" width=\"1274\" height=\"826\" />\r<br />\nApple is also investigating an issue where complications like Activity rings on a watch face might \"temporarily turn pink,\" according to the memo.
