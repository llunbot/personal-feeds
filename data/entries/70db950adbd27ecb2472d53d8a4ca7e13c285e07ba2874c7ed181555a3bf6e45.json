The listing was removed hours after it went up after enthusiasts on social media and forums discovered it and pieced together what it likely was. Some of those enthusiasts said in the private Facebook group \"Star Trek Prop Makers &amp; Collectors\" that they had contacted the seller suggesting it be returned to its rightful owners, which many believe to be the estate of <em>Star Trek</em> creator Gene Roddenberry.</p>\n<p>On Thursday evening, Rod Roddenberry, son of <em>Star Trek</em> creator Gene Roddenberry and steward of the Roddenberry estate, shared a message on Facebook expressing a desire to get in touch with the seller to see about the model's return. That post has since become inaccessible, but a nearly identical one appeared on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Friday afternoon.
