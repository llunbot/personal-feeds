If you’re thinking about buying one of the new ‌iPad Pro‌ models and don’t know if you should get a keyboard, this article walks through all of the new features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/magic-keyboard-1.jpg\" width=\"1473\" height=\"829\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Design</h2>\r<br />\nApple hasn’t changed the underlying look of the Magic Keyboard, and it continues to use the floating cantilever design introduced with the prior version.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/magic-keyboard-2.jpg\" width=\"1225\" height=\"689\" />\r<br />\nA magnetic back connects to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, allowing for multiple viewing angles by adjusting the amount of tilt. The ‌iPad‌ hovers over the keyboard and palm rest, which is now made from aluminum, much like the MacBook.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe keys are backlit and use a scissor mechanism with 1mm of travel, the same as the prior-generation model. The outer cover provides front and back protection to keep the ‌iPad‌ safe when traveling.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Function Keys</h2>\r<br />\nThe updated Magic Keyboard has a dedicated row of function keys for increasing and lowering brightness, changing the volume, controlling media playback, locking the display, initiating a search, turning on Do Not Disturb, starting dictation, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/magic-keyboard-3.jpg\" width=\"3174\" height=\"1785\" />\r<br />\nThe function row is similar to the function row on the Mac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Trackpad</h2>\r<br />\nApple made the trackpad from glass and increased the size, making it easier to work with. The trackpad supports haptic feedback, allowing for multi-touch gestures and improving precision-based tasks like editing spreadsheets and selecting text.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Colors</h2>\r<br />\nThe Magic Keyboard comes in black and white.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/magic-keyboard-4.jpg\" width=\"2073\" height=\"1166\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Passthrough Charging</h2>\r<br />\nWhile the Magic Keyboard uses the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-connector/\">Smart Connector</a> on the ‌iPad‌ to connect, there is an included USB-C port that can be used for passthrough charging.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Compatibility</h2>\r<br />\nThe new Magic Keyboard is compatible with the M4 ‌iPad Pro‌ models, and it comes in 11-inch and 13-inch sizes. It does not work with other ‌iPad‌ models, and the prior version of the Magic Keyboard does not work with the M4 ‌iPad Pro‌ models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Price</h2>\r<br />\nThe 11-inch version of the Magic Keyboard is priced at $299, and the 13-inch model is $349.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-keyboard/\">Magic Keyboard</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/09/ipad-pro-magic-keyboard/\">What’s New With the iPad Pro Magic Keyboard</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what’s-new-with-the-ipad-pro-magic-keyboard.2425899/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"12c38e1fe7f3e808487d80253bab969b78add7cc8924ab25ed8b49e2a639b5e2","category":"Apple"}
