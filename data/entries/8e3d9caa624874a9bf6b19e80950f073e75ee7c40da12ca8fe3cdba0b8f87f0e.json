Well, it’s got an interesting story…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“Back in 2013 I was invited to show a bicycle at the Portland Art Museum. I was told there would be a collection of around 40 historic bicycles on display, and there would be space in the foyer for myself and other local builders to show off some of our work. At around this time, hand made bicycles were at the peak of their popularity, and I thought, Wow, this is likely a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I mean, how many people get to make something with their own hands and display it in a major museum?”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>… and it’s for sale! <a href=\"https://www.ahearnecycles.com/bicycles-for-sale-blog/2021/9/20/stainless-steel-touring-bike-24998\" target=\"_blank\">Ahearne Cycles is asking $24,998 $19,950</a> for this beauty.
