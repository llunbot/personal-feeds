The new iPad Pro models use low-power LTPO technology, according to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1787890275656024118\">display industry expert Ross Young</a>, allowing the display to ramp down to 10Hz for static content. This change will contribute to lower power consumption, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/2024-ipad-battery-life/\">advertised battery life is unchanged</a> overall compared to the previous iPad Pro generation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe same situation happened a few years ago with the iPhone 13 Pro models, which also support ProMotion down to 10Hz, but lack an always-on display option. The feature finally arrived on the iPhone with the iPhone 14 Pro models, which can ramp down to 1Hz, and Apple Watch models with an always-on display also reach 1Hz.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll in all, the iPad Pro is unlikely to get an always-on display option until if and when it too supports a 1Hz refresh rate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says the iPad Pro now features \"state-of-the-art tandem OLED technology that uses two OLED panels and combines the light from both to provide phenomenal full-screen brightness.\" The new iPad Pro models can achieve up to 1,000 nits of full-screen brightness for SDR content, compared to 600 nits for the previous-generation models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new iPad Pro models are available to order starting today and launch on Wednesday, May 15.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/promotion/\">ProMotion</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro\">iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/new-ipad-pro-still-lacks-always-on-display/\">New iPad Pros Support Lower Refresh Rate, But Lack Always-On Display</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipad-pros-support-lower-refresh-rate-but-lack-always-on-display.2425689/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"60684e96c65b895993e0beb67a0cb261872d60771924581d10e092c6846ad9e0","category":"Apple"}
