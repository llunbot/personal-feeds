Directed by acclaimed filmmaker Todd Haynes, \"The Velvet Underground\" shows just how the group became a cultural touchstone representing a range of contradictions: the band is both of their time, yet timeless; literary yet realistic; rooted in high art and street culture.</blockquote>\"The Velvet Underground\" premieres on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV+</a> on October 15, 2021, and joins several other documentaries that Apple has picked up such as Werner Herzog's \"Fireball: Visitors from Darker Worlds,\" \"Boys State,\" \"Beastie Boys Story,\" \"Dads,\" and \"The Elephant Queen.\"<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/\">Apple TV Shows</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/31/apple-tv-velvet-underground-trailer-oct-15/\">Apple TV+ Shares 'The Velvet Underground' Trailer Ahead of October 15 Premiere</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-shares-the-velvet-underground-trailer-ahead-of-october-15-premiere.2309258/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nOT7ztklEsY:BKzda2YDDMQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nOT7ztklEsY:BKzda2YDDMQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/nOT7ztklEsY\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1654c7830b315b8f2c6023505bd1d774711caca4d54092534a989a74a0131498","category":"Apple"}
