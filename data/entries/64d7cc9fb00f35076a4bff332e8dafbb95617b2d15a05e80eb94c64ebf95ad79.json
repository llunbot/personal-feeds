After first claiming to have breached the network of the publicly traded digital lending company MeridianLink, AlphV officials posted a screenshot of a complaint it said it filed with the SEC through the agency’s website. Under a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/secg-cybersecurity\">recently adopted rule</a> that goes into effect next month, publicly traded companies must file an SEC disclosure within four days of learning of a security incident that had a “material” impact on their business.</p>\n<p>“We want to bring to your attention a concerning issue regarding MeridianLink's compliance with the recently adopted cybersecurity incident disclosure rules,” AlphV officials wrote in the complaint. “It has come to our attention that MeridianLink, in light of a significant breach compromising customer data and operational information, has failed to file the requisite disclosure under item 1.05 of form 8-K within the stipulated four business days, as mandated by the new SEC rules.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984663#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984663&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"64d7cc9fb00f35076a4bff332e8dafbb95617b2d15a05e80eb94c64ebf95ad79","category":"Tech"}
