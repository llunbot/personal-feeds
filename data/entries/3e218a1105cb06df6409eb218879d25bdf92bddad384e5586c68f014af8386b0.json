Designed for users with physical disabilities, Eye Tracking uses the front-facing camera to set up and calibrate in seconds, and with on-device machine learning, all data used to set up and control this feature is kept securely on device, and isn’t shared with Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEye Tracking works across iPadOS and iOS apps, and doesn’t require additional hardware or accessories. With Eye Tracking, users can navigate through the elements of an app and use Dwell Control to activate each element, accessing additional functions such as physical buttons, swipes, and other gestures solely with their eyes.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMore details to follow…<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/accessibility/\">Accessibility</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/ios-18-accessibility-features/\">Apple Announces iOS 18 Accessibility Features, Including Eye Tracking</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-ios-18-accessibility-features-including-eye-tracking.2426404/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3e218a1105cb06df6409eb218879d25bdf92bddad384e5586c68f014af8386b0","category":"Apple"}
