You get the sense that we would learn little if we\nwere privy to a twenty-four-hour-a-day live stream of its every\nprivate utterance. Part of what was so appalling about Trump and\nVance’s recent meeting with <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/volodymyr-zelensky-has-a-plan-for-ukraines-victory\">Volodymyr Zelensky</a> was not\njust their penchant for channelling the world view and negotiating\npoints of <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/vladimir-putin\">Vladimir Putin</a> but their comfort in expressing\nthem, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/newsletter/the-daily/trump-and-zelenskys-stunning-fight\"><em>barking</em> them</a>, at the Ukrainian President in front\nof reporters in the Oval Office.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Stupidity and ignorance as a governing style. That’s it. They are <em>exactly</em> who they claim they are, and in private speak how they do in public.

Few issues in science had as much expert consensus.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/03/thompson-no-vaxxers\">These idiots think vaccines</a> — one of the great breakthroughs in the history of science and medicine — are a bigger health risk than the diseases they immunize against. Now there are unvaccinated American kids dying from measles, a disease that was effectively wiped out in the modern world by the time I was born.</p>\n\n<p>Now they’re bringing the same sort of idiocy, unbound by critical thinking, history, or anything recognized as economic expertise, to trade policy.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/06/the-spectacle-of-incompetence\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2a5f7c49c407b483029719d6365300cfa9b16b54e57dd1bb472db1e2c6927533","category":"Tech"}
