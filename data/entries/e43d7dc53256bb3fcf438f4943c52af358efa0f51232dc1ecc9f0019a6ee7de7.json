While the next-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models have consistently been rumored to launch in 2024 rather than this year, reports around refreshes of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> have been mixed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMost recently, a reliable Weibo leaker said that the sixth-generation ‌iPad Air‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/10/ipad-air-6-rumored-to-launch-in-october/\">should launch in October</a> as the only ‌iPad‌ refresh of 2023, with \"no mini and Pro this year.\" On the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/the-macrumors-show-mark-gurman-iphone-15-event-expectations/\">latest episode</a> of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/\">The MacRumors Show</a> podcast, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> said that there is a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/09/gurman-october-apple-event-unlikely/\">new iPad Air</a> with improved specifications in the works and the device is apparently \"coming soonish,\" likely in October. Given Kuo's latest statement, the launch of a new ‌iPad Air‌ in October now seems to be in doubt. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast week, Kuo said that Apple likely <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/\">no longer plans</a> to release any new MacBook models with M3-series chips this year. All in all, following its \"Wonderlust\" event to unveil the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> lineup, Apple's potential releases for the remainder of 2023 may be dwindling.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/\">Kuo: New iPads 'Unlikely' to Launch This Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year.2401133/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e43d7dc53256bb3fcf438f4943c52af358efa0f51232dc1ecc9f0019a6ee7de7","category":"Apple"}
