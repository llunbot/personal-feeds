In their place are updated bikes from a host of brands, including Canyon, Pinarello, Trek and Wilier on the road and Giant and Trek (again) on gravel.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here’s an updated list of the new bikes and tech that have leaked out so far in 2024. Stay tuned, as we’ll keep this post updated as more shiny new stuff comes to light as the season progresses. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n

we call it? We reckon that Trek has run out of anagrams for ‘Madone’, so this new bike must either be an Emonda, a new new Madone, or a Domane (unlikely). The bike has both Madone and Emonda labels on the top tube, so Trek is clearly enjoying the guessing game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike ridden by Mads Pedersen, Tao Geoghegan Hart (pictured above) and the rest of the Lidl-Trek team has gone on a diet. While it retains the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/trek-madone-review\" target=\"_blank\">Madone Gen 7</a> shape with its distinctive seatpost cluster, the down tube, seatpost and stays are markedly skinnier than the Madone. So our money is on it being a new Emonda – or perhaps a Madone Lite? </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Updated Canyon Aeroad</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-2155853137-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-2155853137-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-2155853137-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-2155853137-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-2155853137-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-2155853137-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-2155853137-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-2155853137-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-2155853137-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-2155853137-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-2155853137-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Blink and you’ll miss them – and in fact the majority of Canyon’s updates to the Aeroad aren’t visible in this shot of Movistar’s Oier Lazkano – but Canyon has made a number of tweaks to its aero bike’s frame, including a repositioned seatpost clamp, now on top of the top tube rather than at the back of the seat tube, as well as what looks to be a slight update to the fork and its head tube junction plus a redesigned bar/stem. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rear triangle may be a little skinnier too, which would line up with the current trend to trim down the rear of aero bikes (as seen in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/giant-propel-advanced-sl-0-review\" target=\"_blank\">Giant Propel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/specialized-tarmac-sl8-vs-sl7\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized Tarmac SL8</a> for example) to save weight and improve compliance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Pinarello Dogma F</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GettyImages-2155707322-970x648.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GettyImages-2155707322-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GettyImages-2155707322-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GettyImages-2155707322-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GettyImages-2155707322-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GettyImages-2155707322-2048x1368.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GettyImages-2155707322-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GettyImages-2155707322-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GettyImages-2155707322-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GettyImages-2155707322-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GettyImages-2155707322-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another bike that looks to have had a subtle update is the Pinarello Dogma F being ridden at the Dauphiné by Ineos Grenadiers. The head tube is now deeper, presumably in search of the aero gains that the UCI’s update of its frame geometry rules allow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with the Aeroad, the rear of the bike also looks to be a little skinnier, as brands find that the majority of the aero benefits occur at the front of the bike, where it hits clean air and that there’s less to gain from deeper tubes further back. It’s an opportunity to lower weight and increase ride comfort at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New lightweight Wilier</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"593\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-04-105246.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-04-105246.jpg 593w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-04-105246-300x276.jpg 300w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There’s a new bike out there from Wilier too. Ridden here by Lenny Martinez of Groupama-FDJ, it looks to be a lightweight model, perhaps an update to the current Wilier 0. The fork looks to have been redesigned, with wider stance, the frame looks even skinnier than the current bike and the bump holding the seatpost clamp has disappeared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the current Wilier 0 has a claimed frame weight of around 800g, expect Wilier to have shaved weight from this, perhaps in search of a whole bike weight to rival the similarly roundish tubed <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-s-works-aethos-review-lightest-ever-disc-brake-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized Aethos</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New SRAM Red XPLR</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C7ouOSVONQQ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C7ouOSVONQQ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Keegan Swenson (@keegels99)</a></p></div></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>When SRAM launched the updated <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/sram-red-axs-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Red AXS groupset</a>, it showcased the 2x 12-speed option, but there was no word of an XPLR version. That’s something of a surprise, as SRAM has always emphasised its 1x options and the compatibility between its groupset components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason for Red XPLR’s absence appeared at the Unbound 2024 gravel race, where a new SRAM Red 1x groupset design was spotted. It’s on the right in the shot below, while the bike in the foreground has an XX Eagle AXS transmission.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SRAM-Red-XPLR-1x-970x646.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SRAM-Red-XPLR-1x-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SRAM-Red-XPLR-1x-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SRAM-Red-XPLR-1x-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SRAM-Red-XPLR-1x-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SRAM-Red-XPLR-1x-2048x1364.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SRAM-Red-XPLR-1x-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SRAM-Red-XPLR-1x-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SRAM-Red-XPLR-1x-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SRAM-Red-XPLR-1x-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SRAM-Red-XPLR-1x-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Life Time Grand Prix/Taylor Chase @chaseincolor</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Red XPLR has a derailleur that follows SRAM’s latest Transmission format, introduced on its Eagle MTB groupsets like above. Here, the derailleur dispenses with a hanger, with a design that wraps the derailleur’s frame interface around both sides of the frame dropout, perhaps marking the end of days for the bent mech hanger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new groupset goes further though, introducing a 13th sprocket. This reduces the jumps between gear ratios, but at the same time removes the 1x to 2x compatibility. It also for now betters SRAM’s MTB groupsets, which top out at 12 speeds, and matches the 13-speed of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/campagnolo-ekar-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Campagnolo’s Ekar</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Trek Checkpoint gravel bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"644\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Trek-gravel-bike-at-Unbound-2024-1-970x644.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Trek-gravel-bike-at-Unbound-2024-1-970x644.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Trek-gravel-bike-at-Unbound-2024-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Trek-gravel-bike-at-Unbound-2024-1-768x510.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Trek-gravel-bike-at-Unbound-2024-1-1536x1020.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Trek-gravel-bike-at-Unbound-2024-1-2048x1360.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Trek-gravel-bike-at-Unbound-2024-1-750x498.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Trek-gravel-bike-at-Unbound-2024-1-1140x757.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Trek-gravel-bike-at-Unbound-2024-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Trek-gravel-bike-at-Unbound-2024-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Trek-gravel-bike-at-Unbound-2024-1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Life Time Grand Prix/Taylor Chase @chaseincolor</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lining up in the first row at Unbound 2024 alongside the race’s winner Lachlan Morton were two copies of a new Trek gravel bike. It’s not just the understated logos that distinguish it from the current <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/trek-checkpoint-slr-9-etap-review\" target=\"_blank\">Checkpoint</a>, there’s a new down tube, which doesn’t have the current Checkpoint’s frame protector. The head tube looks to have been redesigned too, removing the ‘nose’ on the current bike and the bottom bracket area looks more overbuilt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Giant Revolt</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/New-Giant-Revolt-970x646.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/New-Giant-Revolt-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/New-Giant-Revolt-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/New-Giant-Revolt-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/New-Giant-Revolt-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/New-Giant-Revolt-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/New-Giant-Revolt-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/New-Giant-Revolt-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/New-Giant-Revolt-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/New-Giant-Revolt-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/New-Giant-Revolt-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Life Time Grand Prix/Taylor Chase @chaseincolor</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another new gravel bike spotted at Unbound looks to be an update to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/giant-revolt-0-review\" target=\"_blank\">Giant Revolt</a>. The fork appears to be beefed up from the current model, although it retains the two fork leg bolts for mounting gear. There looks to be greater front end integration, with a one piece bar/stem and internal cable routing, although with its longer reach this may be a pro-level one-off. The new bike also includes down tube storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Extra-wide Zipp wheels</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/045-TCG02735-%40chaseincolor-970x647.jpg\" /><figcaption>Life Time Grand Prix/Taylor Chase @chaseincolor</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A number of riders at Unbound were on Zipp wheels which appeared to have grown even more in width from its current generation’s 25mm internal rim. We’d guess that these are new gravel-specific wheel rims, designed to support and provide improved aerodynamics with even-wider gravel bike tyres. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Oakley-alike Scicon glasses</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"592\" height=\"395\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/New-Scicon-glasses.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/New-Scicon-glasses.jpg 592w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/New-Scicon-glasses-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/New-Scicon-glasses-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/New-Scicon-glasses-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Pissei/Instagram</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Earlier in the season, we spotted Tim Wellens on a recce of the route of Strade Bianche in a new model of sunglasses from team sponsor Scicon. Look familiar? The lens-integrated nosepiece shares more than a passing resemblance to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/oakley-kato-cycling-sunglasses\" target=\"_blank\">Oakley Kato</a> sunnies beloved of Mark Cavendish and others. The lens size looks to trump Oakley though – maybe the start of another sunglass arms race?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Supersized Ekoï pedals</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"910\" height=\"606\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Ekoi-pedals.jpg\" alt=\"New Ekoi pedals\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Ekoi-pedals.jpg 910w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Ekoi-pedals-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Ekoi-pedals-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Ekoi-pedals-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Ekoi-pedals-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Ekoi-pedals-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Ekoi-pedals-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Facebook - Team Nice Métropole Côte d'Azur</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The UCI Pro Continental team Nice Métropole Côte d’Azur has been spotted using some novel pedals with a really large platform. The pedals appear to be a new departure for team sponsor Ekoï, whose normal stock in trade is cycle clothing, although it does extend to shoes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either there’s a massive cleat bolted to the bottom of the team’s shoes, or it’s a novel system purpose-designed to mesh with the pedals and potentially built into the sole of the shoes. Judging by the shape of the pedals, It looks as if Ekoï might be following Wahoo Speedplay in building the release mechanism into the cleat rather than the pedal body. Expect weight savings and aero gains to be touted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, the team wasn’t able to use the new pedals on its first planned race outing, as the UCI banned them due to the paperwork not having been filled out prior to the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Kask Utopia?</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/CAuldPhoto-INEOS-2024-5580_d0amcz-970x647.webp\" alt=\"New Kask aero helmet\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/CAuldPhoto-INEOS-2024-5580_d0amcz-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/CAuldPhoto-INEOS-2024-5580_d0amcz-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/CAuldPhoto-INEOS-2024-5580_d0amcz-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/CAuldPhoto-INEOS-2024-5580_d0amcz-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/CAuldPhoto-INEOS-2024-5580_d0amcz-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/CAuldPhoto-INEOS-2024-5580_d0amcz-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/CAuldPhoto-INEOS-2024-5580_d0amcz-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/CAuldPhoto-INEOS-2024-5580_d0amcz-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/CAuldPhoto-INEOS-2024-5580_d0amcz-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/CAuldPhoto-INEOS-2024-5580_d0amcz.webp 1600w\" /><figcaption>C Auld Photo/Ineos Grenadiers</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Here is what looks to be an update to the Kask Utopia aero helmet, as first spotted on the head of several Ineos Grenadiers riders at their winter camp. While the current <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/kask-utopia-y-review\" target=\"_blank\">Utopia Y</a> helmet has a single central vent at its front, the new helmet has a second vent above this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lower vent looks to have decreased in size from that in the current helmet, but the addition of the second vent above a cross-rib may have increased the total venting, presumably improving airflow through the helmet and cooling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Extra frontal airflow may be needed, as the new helmet also sits lower on the head than the current Utopia and encloses the tops of the riders’ ear lobes, presumably to improve airflow over the sides of the head. There’s less venting around the sides and a more pointed tail than in the Utopia Y, which again are likely to improve aerodynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon-branded cycling shoes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"643\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Canyon-SRAM-team-cycling-shoes-970x643.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon SRAM team cycling shoes\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Canyon-SRAM-team-cycling-shoes-970x643.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Canyon-SRAM-team-cycling-shoes-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Canyon-SRAM-team-cycling-shoes-768x509.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Canyon-SRAM-team-cycling-shoes-750x497.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Canyon-SRAM-team-cycling-shoes-1140x756.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Canyon-SRAM-team-cycling-shoes-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Canyon-SRAM-team-cycling-shoes.jpg 1193w\" /><figcaption>X / Canyon//SRAM</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Canyon-SRAM women’s cycling team has shown off its new <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2024-pro-cycling-kit\" target=\"_blank\">2024 kit</a> on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. Alongside the Canyon own-brand clothing, one shot showed some smart-looking white shoes, complete with a Canyon logo on the heel cup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boa was a team sponsor last year and it looks to have contributed two of its fanciest dial closures to the new shoes, which have some interesting-looking reinforcement under the upper Boa dial as well as plenty of venting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon has put its branding on other companies’ cycling gear in the past, including a range of Abus helmets (although Canyon-SRAM wear helmets from Giro), but the brand has increased its clothing and accessories output in the past few years so it’s no surprise shoes would be the next step. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it is a Canyon product, it is likely to have been produced in conjunction with a shoe specialist, much like previous clothing releases made in partnership with companies such as Kalas and Etxeondo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Check out our guide to <a
