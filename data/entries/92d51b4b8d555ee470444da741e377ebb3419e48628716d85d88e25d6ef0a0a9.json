Sure, a Gold Star Membership costs $65, but now it also comes with a $45 Digital Costco Shop Card. That’s $45 to spend in person or online at Costco. Here’s how to make that happen: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you have to either be a new member or have had your membership expire for 18 months or longer. If you’ve been putting off renewing your membership, here’s your sign. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you’ll buy your Costco Gold Star Membership here for $65. That’s the same price you’d normally pay, by the way. Important: make sure to use a valid email when you sign up. That’s because within two weeks of redeeming your membership, you’ll get your $45 Digital Costco Shop Card in your inbox. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that’s left is to go shopping. You can use your $45 in-person or online. How many hotdogs would that cover? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might be time to trade all those little errands for a trip to Costco. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get a <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/costco-1-year-gold-star-membership-45-digital-costco-shop-card?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=costco-1-year-gold-star-membership-45-digital-costco-shop-card&amp;utm_term=scsf-612158&amp;utm_content=a0xRn0000030dUSIAY&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">Costco 1-Year gold Star Membership</a> and a $45 Digital Costco Shop Card for $65. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/costco-1-year-gold-star-membership-45-digital-costco-shop-card?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=costco-1-year-gold-star-membership-45-digital-costco-shop-card&amp;utm_term=scsf-612158&amp;utm_content=a0xRn0000030dUSIAY&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp1.stackassets.com/5c1d2bdda62c3183124e7744ad8fa1e4770b4d01/store/b043cc8af2420537be43a692c406304a9b141211cd677d6ccf93c08e3a51/sale_327464_primary_image.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Costco 1-Year Gold Star Membership + $45 Digital Costco Shop Card – $65</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/costco-1-year-gold-star-membership-45-digital-costco-shop-card?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=costco-1-year-gold-star-membership-45-digital-costco-shop-card&amp;utm_term=scsf-612158&amp;utm_content=a0xRn0000030dUSIAY&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com\" target=\"_blank\">StackSocial</a> prices subject to change. </em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"92d51b4b8d555ee470444da741e377ebb3419e48628716d85d88e25d6ef0a0a9","category":"Apple"}
