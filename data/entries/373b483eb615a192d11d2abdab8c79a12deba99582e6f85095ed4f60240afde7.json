That’s right; you can now watch the chaos, carnage (hopefully not too much), and glory of the world’s biggest gravel race in real-time without a single paywall in sight. No, it’s not Tiz-Cycling (<a href=\"https://tiz-cycling.tv/main/\">we love our Tiz time, though</a>). It’s LifeTime itself offering the coverage.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This coverage of Unbound has been a long time in the making. Since FloSports discontinued its LifeTime Grand Prix coverage in 2022, fans have been left in the digital dust. But this year, Life Time is going big, streaming <em>seven full hours</em> of uninterrupted race footage straight from the soul of gravel country: Emporia, Kansas.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Dominique-Powers_Unbound-racing-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Dominique-Powers_Unbound-racing-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Hunt 40 Limitless Gravel Aero optimized off-road racing wheels, Unbound racing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Dominique-Powers_Unbound-racing-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Dominique-Powers_Unbound-racing-297x149.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Dominique-Powers_Unbound-racing-1536x768.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Dominique-Powers_Unbound-racing-120x60.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Dominique-Powers_Unbound-racing-768x384.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Dominique Powers)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>From Grassroots to Global Showdown</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now in its 19th year, Unbound has grown into a global fixture, drawing over 4,000 riders to the Flint Hills for a five-race buffet of pain, ranging from a mellow (ish) 25 miles to a soul-wrecking 350-mile sufferfest. <em>You’ll see it all:</em> weekend warriors, die-hard dirt junkies, and WorldTour stars trading watts on the same chunky backroads.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Unbound-Gravel-bans-Aerobars-for-Elite-racing_muddy-men.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1250\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Unbound-Gravel-bans-Aerobars-for-Elite-racing_muddy-men.jpg\" alt=\"Unbound Gravel bans Aerobars for Elite racing, muddy elite men\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Unbound-Gravel-bans-Aerobars-for-Elite-racing_muddy-men.jpg 1400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Unbound-Gravel-bans-Aerobars-for-Elite-racing_muddy-men-297x265.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Unbound-Gravel-bans-Aerobars-for-Elite-racing_muddy-men-800x714.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Unbound-Gravel-bans-Aerobars-for-Elite-racing_muddy-men-120x107.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Unbound-Gravel-bans-Aerobars-for-Elite-racing_muddy-men-768x686.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Back in the aero-bar-legal days of Unbound.

It’s where reputations are made, sponsors take notes, and cycling legends either rise or explode in a puff of limestone dust.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Watch the Whole Thing, Live and Free</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first time, the elite men’s and women’s 200-mile races will be broadcast live, start to finish, with no geo-blocking and no subscriptions, bringing you gritty racing straight to your screen. Coverage kicks off Saturday, May 31, at 10:00 a.m. CT on the Life Time Grand Prix YouTube channel, with a pre-show leading into wall-to-wall race action and post-race reactions.
