Focused on comfort and simplicity and built with innovative materials, Atoms are designed for how you live, work and play — everyday. They are unlike any shoes you have ever worn. First-of-its-kind quarter sizing gives you the perfect fit. Atoms’ stretchy laces make it easy to slip on and off. Insoles made with copper thread neutralize odor. And lightweight materials make Atoms exceptionally comfortable, and durable. </p>\n\n<p>For holidays, Atoms has launched three new colorways, a limited edition art collaboration, and also brought back the popular Navy Blue and Neons. On top of that Atoms is offering $20 off of one pair or $50. <a href=\"http://atoms.com/df\">Experience them for yourself</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2021/11/atoms_new_colors_holiday_disco\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"Daring Fireball Department of Commerce","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9cd7e7a2259247a39f58c6838e1ea1eebdce563485d0fa1e93e940eff6d16a99","category":"Tech"}
