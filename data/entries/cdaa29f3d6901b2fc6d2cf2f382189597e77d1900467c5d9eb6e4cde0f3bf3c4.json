Today, though, we've found ourselves enamored with a <em>Super Mario Kart</em> ROM patch that easily makes the game much, much worse.</p>\n<p>Longtime Super Mario Kart hacker MrL314 calls <em>Resident Evil Kart</em> \"the worst thing I have ever created,\" and it's not hard to see why. As implied by the title, <a href=\"https://romhacks.org/romhacks/resident-evil-kart-snes/\">the ROM patch</a> replaces <em>Super Mario Kart</em>'s usual over-the-shoulder tracking camera with something more akin to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U__XY64ctsQ\">the awkward fixed-angle \"perspective shots\" of the original PlayStation 1 <em>Resident Evil</em> games</a>. The perspective automatically jumps between these fixed cameras around the track as your racer moves from section to section, forcing you to judge turns and obstacles from very skewed angles.</p>\n<div><div></div><p><em>Resident Evil Kart</em> release trailer. </p></div>\n<p>MrL314 writes that the idea for this hack arose from time spent \"researching how the camera system in <em>Super Mario Kart</em> works\" as part of the development of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhmaNejxw68\">the impressive-looking <em>Super Mario Kart Deluxe</em></a>.
