The ad appeared before the conventional screensaver kicks in,\nas shown below, and was localized to the region the TV was set to.</p>\n\n<p>We saw an ad for LG Channels — the company’s free, ad-supported\nstreaming service — but there can also be full-screen ads from\nexternal partners, as shown in the company’s own example below.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Death comes for us all.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Amazon, Google, and Roku have long built their respective TV\nmonetization strategies around ads, and with LG and Samsung\nturning webOS and Tizen into digital billboards, the only refuge\nappears to be Apple TV 4K, which can be connected to any TV. You\ncan now disconnect your TV from the internet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I bought an LG OLED in 2020 that hasn’t been connected to the internet since a few days after we started using it.
