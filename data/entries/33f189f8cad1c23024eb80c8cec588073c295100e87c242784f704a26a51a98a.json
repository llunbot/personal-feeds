{"title":"The iPad mini is cheaper than it’s ever been","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2426039/the-ipad-mini-is-cheaper-than-its-ever-been.html","date":1723564878000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for a light back-to-school tablet, a portable reader for the beach, or just a great device for games and movies? In that case, today’s deal can’t be beaten: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9BXKF5\">Amazon is selling the iPad mini with 64GB of storage in all colors for $380</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9LPNLG\">256GB model for $530</a>, a savings of $119 and the lowest price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is working on <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/ipad-mini-7-specs-design-processor-release.html\">a new iPad mini</a>, but it’s not expected to be much different other than a faster processor. The only possible rub is Apple Intelligence, which isn’t supported on this mini. However, we’re not sure if the next iPad mini will have the required 8GB of RAM to run Apple Intelligence—the current model has 4GB, so it would require a massive boost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668142/ipad-mini-6-2021-review.html\">current model</a> is already a great option, with a super-light design built around an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, A15 processor, and a 12MP ultra-wide front camera. It’s also got a Touch ID-enabled power button and a fast-charging USB-C charging port. Weighing about a half-pound, it’s smaller and lighter than a book, and sturdy enough to cram into any bag or backpack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, it’ll be ready to run iPadOS 18 when it arrives later this fall. So go grab one right now. </p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"33f189f8cad1c23024eb80c8cec588073c295100e87c242784f704a26a51a98a","category":"Apple"}
