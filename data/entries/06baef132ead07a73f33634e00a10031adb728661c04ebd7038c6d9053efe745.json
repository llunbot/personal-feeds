This is typically a document that a professor, faced with the same questions semester after semester, has put together to save the most time possible and get back to their work. I recently found such a document inside Princeton University's astrophysics department: \"<a href=\"https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~strauss/AST303/Xintro.pdf\">An Introduction to the X Window System</a>,\" written by <a href=\"https://web.astro.princeton.edu/people/robert-lupton\">Robert Lupton</a>.</p>\n<p>X Window System, which <a href=\"https://www.talisman.org/x-debut.shtml\">turned 40 years old earlier this week</a>, was something you had to know how to use to work with space-facing instruments back in the early 1980s, when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100\">VT100s</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX-11\">VAX-11/750s</a>, and Sun Microsystems boxes would share space at college computer labs. As the member of the AstroPhysical Sciences Department at Princeton who knew the most about computers back then, it fell to Lupton to fix things and take questions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032813#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032813&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"06baef132ead07a73f33634e00a10031adb728661c04ebd7038c6d9053efe745","category":"Tech"}
