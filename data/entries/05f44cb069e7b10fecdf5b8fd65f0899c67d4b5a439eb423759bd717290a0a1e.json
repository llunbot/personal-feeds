In March, Gurman said Apple's foldable iPhone could be arriving \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/foldable-iphone-to-launch-next-year/\">as early as 2026.</a>\" Then again in March, Gurman <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-23/apple-aapl-explores-turning-watches-into-wearable-ai-devices-with-cameras-m8ll6mvy\">said</a>: \"I expect the company to launch its own foldable phone next year,\" suggesting his conviction had strengthened that 2026 would indeed be the year of the foldable iPhone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn April, however, Gurman's reporting about the roadmap of Apple's foldable devices became more obscure. Describing a \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/apple-new-20th-anniversary-design-iphone-pro/\">major shake-up</a>\" for the iPhone's 20th anniversary in 2027, Gurman said that Apple plans to launch a foldable iPhone alongside a \"bold\" new iPhone Pro model that makes more extensive use of glass. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven that Gurman had previously said he expects Apple's first foldable iPhone to be released next year, logic seemed to dictate that the \"foldable version\" he now said was coming in 2027 would be a second iteration of that model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis no longer appears to be the case. Gurman did not give any explanation as to why his latest reporting has changed on the launch schedule of the foldable. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to a <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-release-schedule-shakeup-new-styles\">recent report </a>by <em>The Information</em> and a roadmap prediction by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/apple-second-foldable-iphone-2027-launch/\">industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, Apple does intend to launch its first foldable iPhone in the second half of next year, so there is still hope that, despite Gurman silently walking back his earlier reporting, we might get a foldable device from Apple as soon as 2026.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/foldable-iphone-expected-2026-rumored-features/\">Foldable iPhone Expected Next Year: All the Rumored Features So Far</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nThe device is expected to have a book-style design with a 5.7-inch outer display when closed and an inner display close to eight inches when open. As for pricing, Gurman expects the device to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/foldable-iphone-to-launch-next-year/\">around $2,000</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>Update:</strong> Gurman has since <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1921899037617262889?s=46\">clarified</a> his position on the foldable iPhone's launch timing, saying his column \"is talking about items that will either launch or be in market for 2027.
