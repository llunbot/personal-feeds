As of writing, no 16-inch MacBook Pro deals are available on Amazon, but be sure to keep an eye on our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-pro-air-deals/\">Best MacBook Deals guide</a> for when those start to appear.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nShoppers should note that the 14-inch MacBook Pro is a pre-order on Amazon right now. You can still order the notebook today at a discount, and it's estimated to begin shipping out on launch day, October 26.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQL8KP9?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$50 OFF</div>14-Inch MacBook Pro (8-Core M1 Pro, 512GB) for $1,949.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new MacBook Pro models feature a redesigned look, with a full-screen display that includes a notch with a 1080p webcam.
