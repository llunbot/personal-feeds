All made entirely in Europe and sold at reasonable prices, Unior Bike Tools continues to deliver quality solutions designed to make workshop life easier.

There’s a Spoke Nipple Shuffler than will speed up custom wheel builds. An update to Master Link Pliers because even chains continue to evolve.

No looking for one of three separate tools. Or confusing the 8mm of a crankbrothers pedal for the 6mm of a Shimano pedal. Compact, simple, and it costs just $20 / 22€. Perfect for the home workshop or traveling toolkit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Speed Pedal Wrenches are well, faster</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Unior-Bike-Tools_professional-Speed-Pedal-Wrench-in-use.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Unior-Bike-Tools_professional-Speed-Pedal-Wrench-in-use.jpg\" alt=\"Unior Bike Tools, pro mechanic Speed Pedal Wrench in 6 or 8mm hex, 90°\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Unior-Bike-Tools_professional-Speed-Pedal-Wrench-in-use.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Unior-Bike-Tools_professional-Speed-Pedal-Wrench-in-use-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Unior-Bike-Tools_professional-Speed-Pedal-Wrench-in-use-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Unior-Bike-Tools_professional-Speed-Pedal-Wrench-in-use-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Unior-Bike-Tools_professional-Speed-Pedal-Wrench-in-use-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Unior-Bike-Tools_professional-Speed-Pedal-Wrench-in-use-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you only have one type of pedals, have extra room in your toolbox, or just work in a bike shop and want something a bit more pro and single use?

Most likely you could get away with some creative filing if you already have a favorite set of chain pliers. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Unior-tools-updated-Master-Link-Pliers.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Unior-tools-updated-Master-Link-Pliers.jpg\" alt=\"Unior Bike Tools, updated Master Link Pliers for 6-13sp chains\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Unior-tools-updated-Master-Link-Pliers.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Unior-tools-updated-Master-Link-Pliers-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Unior-tools-updated-Master-Link-Pliers-800x400.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Unior-tools-updated-Master-Link-Pliers-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Unior-tools-updated-Master-Link-Pliers-768x384.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you are in the market for a new set, Unior’s updated black Master Link Pliers 1720/4DP will only set you back $16 / 22€ and they’ll open quick links on pretty much any chain from 6-13-speeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Universal Bearing Press kit got updated along the line</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Universal-Bike-Tools-Bearing-Press-kit-got-updated-along-the-line.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Universal-Bike-Tools-Bearing-Press-kit-got-updated-along-the-line.jpg\" alt=\"Unior Bike Tools, Universal Bearing Press Kit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Universal-Bike-Tools-Bearing-Press-kit-got-updated-along-the-line.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Universal-Bike-Tools-Bearing-Press-kit-got-updated-along-the-line-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Universal-Bike-Tools-Bearing-Press-kit-got-updated-along-the-line-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Universal-Bike-Tools-Bearing-Press-kit-got-updated-along-the-line-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Universal-Bike-Tools-Bearing-Press-kit-got-updated-along-the-line-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a small running addition… I’m not entirely sure when this update happened. But I’ve been recently doing some off-season maintenance with the latest edition of Unior’s Universal Bearing Press kit. And it’s been updated since we first caught up with it back in <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/eb14-unior-tools-fix-anything-plus-prototype-tread-shaver-more-new-stuff/\" target=\"_blank\">2014</a>. The kit now includes all of the latest common sizes, specifically updated bottom bracket standards like DUB. It’s a workshop-level piece of gear with the $279 / 308€ pricetag to match.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it’ll press in pretty much any size bearing you’ll find on a bike these days, short of headset cups. And, if you only need the BB presses, there’s a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/unior-rolls-out-bmx-tools-master-wheel-building-kit-brake-nut-tool-much-more/\" target=\"_blank\">separate cheaper kit</a> for that now since last spring, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of these new tools might just make a perfect stocking stuffer for your home mechanic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that winter is the perfect time to give you neglected bike the much needed maintenance love that it deserves. Happy bike, happy life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://Unior-Bike.com\"><em>Unior-Bike.com</em></a> &amp; <a href=\"https://uniorusa.com/\"><em>UniorUSA.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-unior-bike-tools-shuffle-your-nipples-spin-pedals-service-ebikes-chains-more/\">New Unior Bike Tools Shuffle Your Nipples, Spin Pedals, Service eBikes, Chains &amp; More</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"02931724651cb352009aa428a85af940ef95f721737b2f153902cfa0ec867bb3","category":"Cycling"}
