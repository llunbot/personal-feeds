They even went back and forth with Shimano, then Campy, then SRAM for electrifying 10, 11 &amp; 12sp.

Instead, you get 2 shift buttons behind the brake lever that look a bit like Di2-style, but with some extra spacing in between them and a different tactile finish on each to make it harder to accidentally hit the wrong lever.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-ergopower-controls-levers-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-ergopower-controls-levers-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless gruppo, electronic-shift hydraulic disc brake 12-speed road bike drivetrain, new Ergopower levers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-ergopower-controls-levers-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-ergopower-controls-levers-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-ergopower-controls-levers-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-ergopower-controls-levers-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-ergopower-controls-levers-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-ergopower-controls-levers-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-ergopower-controls-levers-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-ergopower-controls-levers-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new levers are said to be easy to adapt to, shifting the upper button with the tip of your index finger, and shifting the lower button with your middle finger. Campagnolo says they moved away from their classic inner thumb-shifter design to appeal to a broader pool of cyclists, some who had trouble operating the inner shift lever, especially those with smaller hands. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking both from the side profile and head-on, it’s clear that these new Ergopower hoods are both wider and larger volume than previous generations of Record &amp; Super Record. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_Egropower-controls-inside.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_Egropower-controls-inside-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless gruppo, electronic-shift hydraulic disc brake 12-speed road bike drivetrain, new Ergopower levers inside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_Egropower-controls-inside-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_Egropower-controls-inside-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_Egropower-controls-inside-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_Egropower-controls-inside-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_Egropower-controls-inside-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_Egropower-controls-inside-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_Egropower-controls-inside.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Presumably, that was a conscious decision to create a more comfortable place to rest your hands based on Campy’s first comments to us, since we’d expect electronics to take up less space inside than mechanical shift internals.

Campagnolo says that in regular use, riders should get 1.5-2 years of battery life out of the non-rechargeable button-cell battery in each shifter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>MyCampy in-app shift customization</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_MyCampy-in-app-customization.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_MyCampy-in-app-customization-800x427.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless gruppo, electronic-shift hydraulic disc brake 12-speed road bike drivetrain, MyCampy in-app shift customization\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_MyCampy-in-app-customization-800x427.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_MyCampy-in-app-customization-297x158.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_MyCampy-in-app-customization-120x64.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_MyCampy-in-app-customization-768x410.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_MyCampy-in-app-customization.jpg 1500w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, one of the biggest benefits to electronic – and even more so, wireless – shifting is the ability to customize its controls. Campy didn’t share much about the new functionality of the updated MyCampy app other than to say that you can customize shift dynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Standard factory settings do use the idea of the right lever controlling the rear derailleur, the left lever controlling the front derailleur, top buttons to a harder gear, bottom buttons to an easier gear. But it is up to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of screengrabs from Campagnolo’s Super Record Wireless presentation suggest some curious combinations. That one on the <em>right</em> looks like it might recreate the <em>One Lever, One Action</em> concept with the right levers making gears easier, and left levers harder? And the image on the left looks like it might be <em>Goblin Mode</em>, just push shifters and hope for the best. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New battery-powered wireless derailleurs</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-electronic-rear-derailleur.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-electronic-rear-derailleur-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless gruppo, electronic-shift hydraulic disc brake 12-speed road bike drivetrain, rear derailleur on bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-electronic-rear-derailleur-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-electronic-rear-derailleur-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-electronic-rear-derailleur-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-electronic-rear-derailleur-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-electronic-rear-derailleur-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-electronic-rear-derailleur-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-electronic-rear-derailleur.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, so new wireless Ergopowers are key, but they have to control something, right?

That of course coordinates with the new 10T cog giving you the same top speed that you could have reached only with a pro-only 55T big chainring. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo says they measure the additional friction loss due to the smaller cogs (comparing 55×11 to 50×10) to be just 0.1W energy loss in the lab with a +/-0.4W margin of error. So their feeling is that the gains from improved shifting and cadence will outweigh any extra drivetrain drag. Campy did suggest this is why Super Record Wireless didn’t go to the smaller 9T like <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/all-new-campagnolo-ekar-1x-lightest-gravel-groupset-available-goes-to-13-speed/\" target=\"_blank\">Campy Ekar</a>.

But Campy are working on a power meter, and we’re pretty sure that’s where it is going to go, likely in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New smaller 12sp cassettes with 10T cog</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_10-29-or-10-25-cassettes-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_10-29-or-10-25-cassettes-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless gruppo, electronic-shift hydraulic disc brake 12-speed road bike drivetrain, new cassette gearing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_10-29-or-10-25-cassettes-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_10-29-or-10-25-cassettes-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_10-29-or-10-25-cassettes-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_10-29-or-10-25-cassettes-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_10-29-or-10-25-cassettes-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_10-29-or-10-25-cassettes-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>10-29T (l) to 10-25T (r)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With new small chainrings comes new smaller gears – with optimized gearing steps, and revised tooth shaping for quicker, smoother gear changes around the new, more compact chainlines. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo will offer three new 12-speed cassette options with the new Super Record Wireless gruppo, all featuring a 10T cog made possible by Campy’s latest <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/campagnolo-n3w-in-detail-how-campys-new-freehub-body-fits-all-10-13-speed-cassettes/\" target=\"_blank\">N3W freehub body</a> innovation.

The single universal master cylinder inside the new Super Record Wireless Ergopower levers and these new brake calipers (<em>claimed 118g, 140mm caliper</em>) are actually the subtle rolling update that debuted with Ekar, and will carry on to other groups. This is the latest evolution of Campagnolo’s excellent hydraulic disc brakes are now entirely developed in-house (separate from the original Magura cooperation), and made by Campy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One new bit here though – peeking out of the calipers <em>above</em> – Super Record Wireless debuts a new Campagnolo crake pad with a lighter aluminum backing plate that Campy says dissipates heat even better than before. The 30% lighter alloy-backed pads are compatible with all Campy brakes and can be retrofitted to any other groupset when you need to replace your pads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The heat-dissipating, semi-floating disc brake rotors are also unchanged – available in 140mm &amp; 160mm diameters with stainless steel braking surface and aluminum centerlock (AFS) carriers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Claimed weight – lightweight or ultralight? </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-levers.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-levers-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless gruppo, electronic-shift hydraulic disc brake 12-speed road bike drivetrain, new levers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-levers-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-levers-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-levers-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-levers-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-levers-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-levers.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, Campagnolo Super Record Wireless claims to effectively weigh the same as the outgoing wired <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2019-campagnolo-super-record-eps-adds-12-speed-to-electronic-pro-road-gruppo/\" target=\"_blank\">Super Record EPS</a> at 2520g for the complete setup. Campy has not yet clarified to us what that includes. It is lightweight, but essentially the same as the top Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 or SRAM Red AXS groups which have all coalesced around that same real 2.5kg weight target in their latest iterations.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you ready to rethink Campy shifting? Wireless electronic shifting is only available at the Super Record level for now (<em>this year?</em>), but Campy effectively confirmed that they are working on bringing wireless electronic shifting to other groupsets, as well – an important shift from the previous generation of EPS that abandoned electronic shifting at Record &amp; Chorus levels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fingers crossed that Ekar Wireless will be next!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless – Pricing &amp; Availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_riding.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_riding-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless gruppo, electronic-shift hydraulic disc brake 12-speed road bike drivetrain, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_riding-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_riding-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_riding-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_riding-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_riding-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_riding.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Officially the new 2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless gruppo goes on sale today for $5400 / 5200€ for a complete 2×12 wireless-shift, hydraulic sic brake groupset with your choice of gearing.
