This change results in faster SSD read and write speeds in tests, as the two chips can process requests in parallel.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMax Tech ran Blackmagic's Disk Speed Test tool with a 5GB file size test on both the M2 and M3 models of the 13-inch MacBook Air with 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, and they found the SSD in the M3 model achieved up to 33% faster write speeds and up to 82% faster read speeds compared to the SSD in the M2 model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nThe change very likely extends to the base model 15-inch MacBook Air with the M3 chip, although Max Tech has yet to tear down that model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's decision to switch to a single 256GB chip for the base model MacBook Air in 2022 was controversial, even though the slower SSD speeds are unlikely to be noticed by the average MacBook Air user working on common day-to-day tasks. Nevertheless, customers who purchase an M3 model no longer need to worry about configuring the laptop with at least 512GB of storage in order to avoid the slower speeds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/M3-MacBook-Air-Dual-128GB-Chips.jpg\" width=\"1569\" height=\"1096\" /><div><em>Two 128GB storage chips in the new base model 13-inch MacBook Air (via Max Tech)</em></div>\r<br />\nThe new MacBook Air models with the M3 chip launched Friday. Apple continues to sell a 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip and 256GB of storage for $999, so customers who want maximum SSD performance should avoid that model.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/09/base-model-m3-macbook-air-faster-ssd/\">Base Model M3 MacBook Air Has Faster SSD Speeds After Controversy With Previous Model</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/base-model-m3-macbook-air-has-faster-ssd-speeds-after-controversy-with-previous-model.2421496/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"215e74103f13accc326f3f29dbbfd271d00a9f6d04eff29864fdd0d015621854","category":"Apple"}
