They're quiet, reliable, and about twice as efficient as the most frugal hybrid, not to mention that whole \"instant torque\" thing. But there's no denying that vehicles with internal combustion engines have a big advantage when driving distances requiring more energy than you set off with. A battery company called StoreDot may have a solution, though—an extremely fast charging cell that could add 100 miles (160 km) of range in just five minutes. And its pack will be tested in a Polestar 5.</p>\n<p>More than a century has conditioned us to think that refueling a car should take just a few minutes, so the 30–60 minutes that most EVs require to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/the-ars-technica-guide-to-electric-vehicle-charging/\">fast-charge</a> seems offensive to many motorists. And <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/electric-cars-are-doomed-if-fast-charger-reliability-doesnt-get-better/\">that's assuming</a> the chargers work flawlessly—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/public-ev-charging-keeps-getting-worse-according-to-new-study/\">far from a safe assumption</a> in 21st century America, unfortunately.</p>\n<p>Right now, most automakers' solution to this problem is to throw lithium-ion at it, building EVs with such big battery storage capacities that an unaerodynamic pickup truck <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/chevrolet-shows-off-the-2024-silverado-ev-its-first-electric-pickup/\">could go more than 400 miles</a> between plug-ins. There are, of course, problems with this approach.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982580#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982580&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
