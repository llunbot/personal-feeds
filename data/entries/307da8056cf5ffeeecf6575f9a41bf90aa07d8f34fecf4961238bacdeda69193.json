Some extras, like more padded bar tape or a saddle upgrade, will add a little more comfort to a bike that’s going to be jolting you around, often for an extended period. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others, like <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-fit-tubeless-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">tubeless tech</a> or tyre inserts, will increase reliability and reduce your potential down-time for punctures or other mechanicals. Then there are upgrades, like new wheels or a dropper post, that will increase performance. Still others, including bags, lights and straps, will equip you for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/an-introduction-to-bikepacking\">bikepacking </a>expeditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t have to spend a fortune to make some real differences to your gravel experience, so here we’ve rounded up some inexpensive options, as well as some costlier ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve plenty of suggestions and have explained why we reckon each will make a difference, and we’ve also recommended some specific products for each, most of which we’ve tried and tested here at <em>Cyclist</em>.

You can buy gravel-specific tape that’s extra thick to cushion your hands, usually at least 3mm thick, and extra-grippy to help keep them attached to the bars. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As usual, there’s an earth-coloured gravel template usually on offer, although sticking to black seems sensible to cut down on the inevitable clean-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>ODI Performance 3.5mm bar tape (<a href=\"https://www.tredz.co.uk/.ODI-Performance-Bar-Tape-3-5mm_90642.htm\" target=\"_blank\">£19.99 at Tredz</a>)</strong></li><li><strong>Fizik Terra Bondcush bar tape (<a href=\"https://www.merlincycles.com/fizik-terra-microtex-bondcush-tacky-bar-tape-142120.html\" target=\"_blank\">£22.00 at Merlin Cycles</a>)</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Cargo straps</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"661\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Pannier_Voile-Straps-Olive-02-970x661.jpeg\" alt=\"Voile strap\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Pannier_Voile-Straps-Olive-02.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Pannier_Voile-Straps-Olive-02.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Pannier_Voile-Straps-Olive-02.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Pannier_Voile-Straps-Olive-02.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Pannier_Voile-Straps-Olive-02.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Pannier_Voile-Straps-Olive-02.jpeg 1500w\" /><figcaption>Pannier.cc</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While road riders can usually fit everything into their jersey pockets and maybe a saddle pack, gravel riding often involves carrying more stuff. Bikepacking means strapping a whole lot of stuff to your bike and the ability to lash small items somewhere convenient makes things a lot easier. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cargo straps come in many designs but Voile straps (sold under both the Voile brand and licensed alternatives) are really versatile and quick to use, with a range of lengths to suit everything from a pump to a tent and you can link up multiple straps to hold larger loads. There are some great colours too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Voile is too rich for your blood, there are some decent cheaper alternatives,</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>PDW Voile Strap 15″ (<a href=\"https://www.condorcycles.com/products/pdw-voile-strap?variant=45118792728897\" target=\"_blank\">£8.50 at Condor Cycles</a>)</strong></li><li><strong>Ortlieb O Strap 190mm (<a href=\"https://www.tredz.co.uk/.Ortlieb-O-Strap-14-5-190mm_256963.htm?sku=919597\" target=\"_blank\">£5.00 at Tredz</a>)</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Tyre inserts</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"750\" height=\"561\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/AirLiner-Gravel.jpg\" alt=\"Vittoria Air-Liner Gravel\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/AirLiner-Gravel.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/AirLiner-Gravel.jpg 300w\" /><figcaption>Vittoria</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re fed up with punctures, it may be time to try tyre inserts. They won’t stop punctures from occurring, but may help you to keep moving when one does occur. They also allow you to run lower pressures, for better grip in poor conditions, with a lower risk of sidewall damage or burping.   </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Vittoria Air-Liner tyre insert (<a href=\"https://www.merlincycles.com/vittoria-air-liner-tubeless-insert-113556.html\" target=\"_blank\">From £24.98 at Merlin Cycles</a>)</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>4.

A set that works well in the mud of winter will usually feel lifeless on dry summer trails. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, a low profile tread that works well in the summer will see you slipping around once things get damp. So although an all-rounder tyre might work well most of the time, it’s worth having a few different options that you can swap in as the seasons and the conditions change. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a versatile all-rounder, consider the Schwalbe G-One R or the Vittoria Terreno Mix.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Schwalbe G-One R Evo (<a href=\"https://www.merlincycles.com/schwalbe-g-one-r-evo-super-race-tle-folding-tyre-700c-1-279562.html\" target=\"_blank\">£62.99 at Merlin Cycles</a>)</strong></li><li><strong>Vittoria Terreno Mix (<a href=\"https://www.tweekscycles.com/vittoria-terreno-mix-gravel-tyre-2015054/?sku=MADTYV0412\" target=\"_blank\">£25.49 at Tweeks Cycles</a>)</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>5.

On your bars, it’s easier to get to while riding and it’s not as prone to get dirty as a saddle pack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve reviewed a range of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-handlebar-bag\">best bar bags</a> in a variety of sizes, from the compact, allowing you to carry a few ride extras, to full-sized bar bags which can carry a substantial part of a bikepacking load. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Restrap Cannister bar bag (<a href=\"https://www.sigmasports.com/item/Restrap/Canister-Handlebar-Bag-15L/OMES?id=1148790\" target=\"_blank\">£50.00 at Sigma Sports</a>)</strong></li><li><strong>Altura Vortex 2 bar bag (<a href=\"https://www.merlincycles.com/altura-vortex-2-waterproof-front-roll-145575.html?\" target=\"_blank\">£29.00 at Merlin Cycles</a>)</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Tubeless tech</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/tubeless_valve.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/tubeless_valve.jpg 800w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/tubeless_valve.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/tubeless_valve.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/tubeless_valve.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/tubeless_valve.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/tubeless_valve.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/tubeless_valve.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Running tubeless is a godsend off-road, helping to avoid down time for fixing punctures and keep you running more smoothly.

This allows you, via a lever on the bars or a repurposed left shift lever, to release the seatpost locking mechanism and lower the seatpost, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dropper posts for gravel bikes typically offer between 50mm and 120mm of travel to get the saddle out of the way when you are descending, helping you to push your weight back and lower your centre of gravity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many gravel bike frames are now designed to allow you to fit a dropper seatpost with internal cable routing, so apart from the extra cable from the bars to the frame, there’s no external change to your bike.

Typically, gravel bike handlebars are wide, with a flare to the drops, which are quite shallow, although some gravel bikes are fitted with bars which are more like those on a road bike. Gravel bike bars are usually made of aluminium alloy, so they’re relatively cheap to replace.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Zipp Service Course SL70 XPLR gravel handlebar (<a href=\"https://www.sigmasports.com/item/Zipp/Service-Course-SL-70-XPLR-Handlebar/SRL9\" target=\"_blank\">£121.00 at Sigma Sports</a>)</strong></li><li><strong>Deda Gera gravel handlebar (<a href=\"https://www.merlincycles.com/deda-gera-dcr-alloy-gravel-handlebars-278548.html\" target=\"_blank\">£64.99 at Merlin Cycles</a>)</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A wider bar can improve ease of steering by providing more leverage. Some have a very pronounced flare, which positions your brake levers at an angle. Some riders like the wide flare, others not so much, but it does increase the room available if you plan to carry a wider bar bag, perhaps to stow a sleeping bag for bikepacking. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to increase your comfort more on uneven ground, you could consider a suspension stem, like that made by Redshift Sports.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Redshift Sports Shockstop stem (<a href=\"https://www.sigmasports.com/item/Redshift-Sports/Shockstop-Stem/KPE8?\" target=\"_blank\">£179.00 at Sigma Sports</a>)</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>11.

So you can buy gravel-specific brake pads that are designed to cope with riding off-road.
