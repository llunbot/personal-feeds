{"title":"YouTube Will Keep ‘Dislike’ Button, but Make Dislike Counts Private to the Creator","link":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/update-to-youtube/","date":1636762936000,"content":"\n<p>YouTube:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As part of this experiment, viewers could still see and use the\ndislike button. But because the count was not visible to them, we\nfound that they were less likely to target a video’s dislike\nbutton to drive up the count. In short, our experiment data showed\na reduction in dislike attacking behavior. We also heard directly\nfrom smaller creators and those just getting started that they are\nunfairly targeted by this behavior — and our experiment confirmed\nthat this does occur at a higher proportion on smaller channels.</p>\n\n<p>Based on what we learned, we’re making the dislike counts private\nacross YouTube, but the dislike button is not going away. This\nchange will start gradually rolling out today.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is an interesting middle ground. Sounds good to me. Marking something as disliked obviously can be useful, but hiding the dislike count apparently diminishes the pile-on mob mindset.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/21/twitter-downvote-button-testing/\">Twitter has been experimenting with a “dislike” button as well</a>. Not sure where that stands, but if they go forward with it, they should keep the dislike counts private too.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/12/youtube-dislike-buttons\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"295e3d6a4b53b04bc79c1b7bda585e34e1fce602b0faeca027b09330b9c84824","category":"Tech"}
