The wheels will be sold separately, with the front setting you back £310 and the rear £450.</p>\n<p>International pricing is to be confirmed.</p>\n<h2>Roval Control SL Cockpit</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bar-stem screams speed.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Roval</i></span></div>\n<p>The Control SL Cockpit is constructed from high-modulus carbon fibre and designed for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cross-country-racing-guide/\">cross-country racing</a>. Roval claims a 250g weight in its 70mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-stems/\">stem</a> length variant.</p>\n<p>The bar-stem is 780mm in width and includes cut marks in case you want to chop it down. It’s available in 60 to 90mm stem lengths.</p>\n<p>The cockpit has a 0mm rise, with a -12-degree integrated stem. It has an 8-degree backsweep and 1-degree upsweep.</p>\n<p>Roval includes titanium bolts and the bar-stem is compatible with the brand’s bolt-on computer mount.</p>\n<h2>Roval Control SL Seatpost</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Roval uses titanium for the mounting bolts, too.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Roval</i></span></div>\n<p>The Control SL <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/seatposts/#seatpostclamps\">Seatpost</a> is also constructed from high-modulus carbon fibre and has a 180g claimed weight.</p>\n<p>It’s only available in a 30.9mm diameter with a 415mm length and is compatible with both alloy and carbon-railed saddles.</p>\n<p>Roval has long been a proponent of using a single bolt to secure the saddle, but like its featherweight Alpinist road seatpost, the Control SL uses a 2-bolt design. A 2-bolt design allows for independent adjustment of the saddle setback and angle.</p>\n<h2>Roval Control Alloy 350 wheels</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Specialized has never been a brand to shy away from pushing the boundaries of aluminium.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Roval</i></span></div>\n<p>The Control Alloy 350s are a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-29er/\">29in</a> wheelset with aluminium rims, although Roval says it holds the wheel to the standards of its Control SL carbon components.</p>\n<p>To increase durability and reduce weight, Specialized says it has customised its shot peening process – a process where metal projectiles are shot at the alloy to increase its strength.</p>\n<p>Roval claims a 1,648g wheel weight, with the front coming in at 768g and the rear at 880g.</p>\n<p>The wheels have a ‘zero bead hook design’, a 27mm internal <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/rim-width-explained-for-road-bikes-mountain-bikes-and-gravel-bikes/\">rim width</a> and a 19mm rim depth.</p>\n<p>Roval says the rims are compatible with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-tubeless-tyre-inserts/\">tyre inserts</a> and can accept between 1.9 and 2.6in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\">mountain bike tyres</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> DT Swiss’ 350 hubs should be a dependable choice.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Roval</i></span></div>\n<p>Roval specs the newly launched <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/dt-swiss-350-road-hub-2023/\">DT Swiss 350 hub</a> in its straight-pull, 6-bolt disc variant. The wheels come stock with a SRAM XD <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/freehubs/\">freehub</a>.</p>\n<p>Lacing the hubs to the 28-hole rims are Sapim’s D-Light straight-pull spokes in a 2-cross pattern. They’re secured with double-squared Sapim alloy nipples.</p>","author":"Oscar Huckle","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"5f0e424bacd61c027922be4de003829dbfd897c8195dfc9ecb22bf129274bedc","category":"Cycling"}
