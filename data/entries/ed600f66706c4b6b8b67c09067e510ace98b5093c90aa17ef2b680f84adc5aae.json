The venture underscores how harnessing AI can shortcut years of experimental graft—and potentially deliver improved products and processes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987154#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987154&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Financial Times","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ed600f66706c4b6b8b67c09067e510ace98b5093c90aa17ef2b680f84adc5aae","category":"Tech"}
