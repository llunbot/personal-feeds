Wilier says it is “perfectly integrated with the frame” thanks to special spacers, and compares the design to one-piece <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-bike-handlebars-guide-how-to-choose-the-right-ones/\">road handlebars</a>.</p>\n<p>The handlebar uses the same HUS-MOD carbon as the frame. It’s said to absorb micro-vibrations on a vertical plane.</p>\n<p>The handlebar has a negative-rise stem. The -27-degree angle enables a powerful pedalling position on technical uphill sections, according to Wilier.</p>\n<h2>Single-pivot suspension system</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The single-pivot suspension system has a connecting bridge between the seatstays.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wilier Triestina</i></span></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">rear suspension</a> of the Urta Max SLR has a single-pivot point, and instead of a seat or chainstay pivot there’s a flex stay to enable suspension articulation.</p>\n<p>To keep torsional stiffness high, there is a connecting bridge between the seatstays.</p>\n<p>Wilier says the leverage rate of the rear suspension has been optimised to perform effectively across different terrain types.</p>\n<p>It claims the initial part of the 45mm travel is regressive, getting stiffer as it compresses. This is said to provide a solid pedalling platform.</p>\n<p>The next part is more linear, helping the bike absorb medium-sized hits and deliver traction.</p>\n<p>The end stroke has more progression to provide bottom-out resistance.</p>\n<p>You can set the rear shock to one of three damper settings: an open setting for technical downhill sections; an intermediate stage for maximum traction on technical climbs and rough terrains; and a closed stage where the bike will ride like a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hardtail-mountain-bikes/\">hardtail</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cross-country-bikes/\">cross-country mountain bike</a> is available with RockShox or Fox rear shocks. Wilier says these shocks have compression tunes tailored to work in “symbiosis” with the system’s different phases.</p>\n<h2>Wilier Triestina Urta Max SLR geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Wilier says the bike’s geometry creates a sense of safety and aggressiveness.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wilier Triestina</i></span></div>\n<p>Wilier says the Urta Max SLR’s geometry has been designed around 120mm-travel <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-suspension-forks/\">suspension forks</a>.</p>\n<p>Wilier set out to keep the rider in a racing position by keeping the stack height low, extending the reach and positioning the bottom bracket low.</p>\n<p>A size-medium frame has a stack height of 598mm and a reach of 443mm. The head angle is 67.5 degrees and the seat tube is 75 degrees.</p>\n<p>Wilier says these measurements mean the wheelbase (1,154mm, medium) of the cross-country mountain bike is longer than the previous Urta.</p>\n<p>According to Wilier, the geometry creates a greater sense of rider safety and aggressiveness.</p>\n<h2>Modern transmissions</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This bike is fitted with Shimano XTR – but you could fit it with a SRAM Eagle Transmission.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wilier Triestina</i></span></div>\n<p>Wilier has designed the Urta Max SLR to accommodate “modern transmissions”.</p>\n<p>In other words, it can fit a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/sram-udh/\">SRAM UDH</a> derailleur hanger, so you can fit a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-gx-eagle-12-speed-drivetrain-review/\">SRAM Eagle Transmission</a>.</p>\n<p>There is room to fit a 38-tooth chainring too.</p>\n<h2>All the trimmings</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike has clearance for 2.4in tyres.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wilier Triestina</i></span></div>\n<p>The Ultra Max SLR frame has room for two <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-water-bottles/\">water bottles</a>, which Wilier says saves time in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cross-country-racing-guide/\">cross-country mountain bike races</a> because you don’t have to stop to refill so often.</p>\n<p>The bike comes with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper post</a> as standard. The small and medium frames come with dropper posts with 100mm of travel, while the large and extra-large frames have droppers with 125mm of travel.</p>\n<p>The rear triangle and its bearings are protected by a rubber cover to prevent mud, dirt and debris from causing damage.</p>\n<p>The bike has clearance for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\">mountain bike tyres</a> up to 2.4in wide.</p>\n<h2>Wilier Triestina Urta Max SLR specs and prices</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The models are available with Fox or RockShox suspension.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wilier Triestina</i></span></div>\n<p>Wilier has provided a list of 20 different builds in the Ultra Max SLR range, with prices starting from €6,200 and rising to €11,200.</p>\n<p>The bikes come with either the new Urta handlebar or a two-piece cockpit with a Wilier Stemma SL aluminium stem.</p>\n<p>There’s a choice of SRAM or Shimano 1×12 <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/drivetrains-explained-all-of-the-parts-that-make-your-bike-go/\">drivetrains</a>.
