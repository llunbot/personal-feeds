But at <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/25x7zev7\" target=\"_blank\">$1,599</a>, the M3 MacBook Pro is $400 cheaper than the M2 Pro/M3 Pro version of the laptop, and it still uses the larger high-refresh-rate ProMotion display, the contrast-boosting and bloom-reducing mini LED screen technology, the MagSafe connector, the 1080p camera, 512GB of storage in the base model, the speaker system, and a full-sized HDMI port. And while Apple quotes the same \"up to 22 hours of battery life\" for all of the new MacBook Pro models, in the real world, the M3 should give you a bit more runtime than the M3 Pro or Max.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979527#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979527&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5d21eb9046f223c7b799c3db9c47a2316c61413b2ea0e8fa10c82a373801f8d0","category":"Tech"}
