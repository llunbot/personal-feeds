{"title":"Six key shoes in O’Neal’s 2022 range","link":"https://www.bikeradar.com/advertising-feature/oneal-2022-mtb-shoes/","date":1634824856000,"content":"<img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/10/ONeal-shoes-1662b5f.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=620,413\" />                                            <p>From clips to flats, casual to enduro, O’Neal has revamped its range of mountain bike shoes for 2022.</p>\n<p>Ranging from £75 to £120, O’Neal’s new footwear range covers all bases whether you’re a trail rider, racing enduro or looking for something more low-key to wear to the pump track and about town.</p>\n<h2>What’s new for 2022?</h2>\n<p>Having been first released in 2017, O’Neal’s latest MTB shoes build on the success of the original line-up, with new and updated models to bring the keenly-priced range bang up-to-date.</p>\n<p>Models from the entry-level Pinned to the top-end Session all focus on delivering value for money, with features you’d usually be surprised to find at each respective price point.</p>\n<p>For the flat pedal shoes, O’Neal’s proprietary Honey Rubber soles have been developed to offer high levels of grip, while still allowing you to reposition your feet easily when you need to.</p>\n<p>Closure systems vary from simple and adjustable laces to Velcro ankle straps for additional support. There’s even a dial and steel lace mechanism at the top end.</p>\n<p>The range also caters to different climates, from the highly ventilated toe box of the Flow shoes to the weather- and dirt-proof cuff of the Session.</p>\n<p>Whether you prefer a stealthy style or pops of colour to match your steed, each model is available in two colourways.</p>\n<h2>O’Neal Pinned</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> O’Neal’s entry-level flat pedal shoe is the Pinned.</span></figcaption><span> <i>O'Neal</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £75</li>\n</ul><p>The Pinned is O’Neal’s entry-level flat shoe, designed to offer plenty of bang-for-your-buck for riders on a budget.</p>\n<p>The honeycomb-shaped Honey Rubber sole offers a balance of grip and freedom of movement, while the upper has been designed to meet the demands of the trail rider.</p>\n<p>That means there’s enough rigidity to give a secure, supportive and efficient fit but with a level of flexibility to offer comfort, whether you’re out for an hour of power or an epic all-dayer. O’Neal also says the upper has been designed with durability as a key focus.</p>\n<p>Either opt for the black with dark grey laces or dark grey colourway with hints of red.</p>\n<h2>O’Neal Pinned Pro</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Pinned Pro steps things up with additional ankle support.</span></figcaption><span> <i>O'Neal</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £80</li>\n</ul><p>As you might expect, the Pinned Pro builds on many of the features of the Pinned but with a greater level of ankle protection thanks to a raised profile and internal support.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for additional protection for bigger moves or simply want to max out on safety features as a beginner, the Pinned Pro could be a good option for you.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of colour options to choose from here: black with grey or a grey outer with hints of bright blue.</p>\n<h2>O’Neal Pinned SPD</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Pinned SPD is designed to be used with clipless pedals, though a screw-in plate ensures compatibility with flat pedals, too.</span></figcaption><span> <i>O'Neal</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £90</li>\n</ul><p>If you’d rather run clipless <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-pedals/\">mountain bike pedals</a> than flats, you should check out the Pinned SPD.</p>\n<p>These feature a different rubber sole to the Pinned and Pinned Pro shoes, with a two-bolt plate for the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/shimano-spd-vs-spd-sl/\">SPD cleats</a>. You can also use them with flat pedals, by using the screw-in plate.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a nylon insert increases the sole’s rigidity for pedalling efficiency. The sole also has a resin running through it to boost stiffness.</p>\n<p>The lace-up closure retains the casual style of the Pinned range. With this SPD model, you can choose from a black/grey colourway or dark grey with neon yellow features on the branding, lace eyelets and tongue.</p>\n<h2>O’Neal Pumps</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The O’Neal Pumps offer a more casual design.</span></figcaption><span> <i>O'Neal</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £85</li>\n</ul><p>From pump track sessions to wearing around town, the Pumps are O’Neal’s answer to a more casual, understated shoe.</p>\n<p>Don’t be fooled by their relaxed appearance though, as these also use O’Neal’s hexagonal Honey Rubber outsole, providing a balance between grip and foot repositioning when you do take to the bike.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the Pumps are designed to offer a little more breathability and flex than the Pinned series, to give it more of a casual, trainer-like feel.</p>\n<p>There are two colourways to choose from; a very subtle black and grey or a more casual grey with gum sole at the heel and toe.</p>\n<h2>O’Neal Flow</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Flow is well suited to more aggressive trail, enduro or downhill riding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>O'Neal</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £110</li>\n</ul><p>The Flow shoes feature a two-bolt SPD plate for riding with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/how-to-use-clipless-pedals/\">clipless pedals</a>, and a roomy, ventilated toe box to help you keep cool in hotter weather. Off to the Alps for your summer holidays? These could be the kicks for you.</p>\n<p>O’Neal has built on the popular Pinned shoes here with an additional Velcro strap to give a secure fit around the ankle, as well as a robust outer suitable for more aggressive <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/beginners-guide-to-enduro-racing/\">enduro racing</a> and downhill riding.</p>\n<p>Take your pick from neutral grey and black or electric blue accents on grey.</p>\n<h2>O’Neal Session</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The O’Neal Session sits at the top of the range.</span></figcaption><span> <i>O'Neal</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price: </strong>£120</li>\n</ul><p>As the most advanced shoe in the O’Neal line-up, the Session SPD is designed with muckier trail conditions in mind.</p>\n<p>The neoprene ankle cuff helps to stop debris and mud trickling down into the shoes, while the ventilated toe box of the Flow is replaced with a more weatherproof upper.</p>\n<p>Just like the Flow shoes, these have been designed to be rugged and robust, and are secured by a highly adjustable dial and lace closure, topped with a Velcro strap to give a stable fit around the ankle.</p>\n<p>The Session shoes are designed to take you right the way from autumn, through winter and into spring and summer. Choose from classic black and grey or a flash of red on grey.</p>","author":"Katherine Moore","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"b283724062f1686dc20f205c56f12904c39d6eaab055d85064a7c9373f139034","category":"Cycling"}
