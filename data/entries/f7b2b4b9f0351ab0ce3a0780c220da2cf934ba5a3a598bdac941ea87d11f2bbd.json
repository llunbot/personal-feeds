When not in use, it folds down into a compact cube shape, which is ideal for travel. The ‌iPhone‌ attaches to the charger magnetically, but note that charging is limited to 7.5W as this is not <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> or Qi2.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lululook-3-in-1-charger-3.jpg\" width=\"1940\" height=\"1200\" />\r<br />\nThe Apple Watch charger is 5W so it can fast charge an Apple Watch, and there is an additional 5W charger for the AirPods and other devices. It also comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable for powering it, but you'll need to supply a power adapter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you only need to charge an ‌iPhone‌ and Apple Watch, Lululook also has a <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Foldable-Wireless-Portable-Charging%2Fdp%2FB0CDWNNBC4%2F%3Fth%3D1\">foldable 2-in-1 Wireless Charger</a> for just $36. The 2-in-1 Charger has the same design as the 3-in-1 model, but with only two foldable platforms rather than three. It too is able to fast charge the Apple Watch and charge an ‌iPhone‌ at 7.5W.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lululook-2-in-1-charger-2.jpg\" width=\"1700\" height=\"1256\" />\r<br />\nAlong with chargers, Lululook has a selection of Apple Watch bands for the Apple Watch Ultra and other devices.

It is ideal for sports and similar activities because it is washable, sweat resistant, and breathable.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lululook-titanium-band-1.jpg\" width=\"1500\" height=\"842\" />\r<br />\nLululook has a <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Titanium-Adjustable-Smartwatch-Resistant%2Fdp%2FB0D5YF5PTX%2F\">$120 Titanium Magnetic Band</a> for those who want a band made from the same material that the Apple Watch is made from, and an <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Titanium-Magnetic-Resistant-Size-Lightweight%2Fdp%2FB0CTJKC7G5%2F\">upgraded luxury version for $300</a>.
