It has gone a long way on the road of video download since 2007. The download quality is one of its highlights: it helps you maintain videos from crisp to great 8K videos.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/YTD-video-downloader.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"YTD Video Downloader screenshot\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/YTD-video-downloader.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1346w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/YTD-video-downloader.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/YTD-video-downloader.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/YTD-video-downloader.jpg?resize=1200%2C799&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/YTD-video-downloader.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/YTD-video-downloader.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"799\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>EaseUS</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Editor’s review:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When testing the YTD Video Downloader on my Mac computer, it’s surprising to see its quick download speed and the connection between PC, phone, and even tablet. However, one weakness of this downloader is that you can only download one video at a time. So, if you need to download many videos from multiple platforms simultaneously, this one is not your best choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><a></a>5. VLC Media Player</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reasons to choose:</strong> open source software; preview while downloading; simple and easy interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Overall rating:</strong> 4.1/5</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>VLC Media Player</strong> is a platform for playing and downloading videos from YouTube and other streaming sites. According to Softonic, more than 84 thousand users have given their comments to it.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/vlc_downloader.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"VLC Downloader screenshot\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/vlc_downloader.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1346w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/vlc_downloader.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/vlc_downloader.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/vlc_downloader.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/vlc_downloader.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/vlc_downloader.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>EaseUS</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Editor’s review:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>VLC Media Player even supports MPEG and DivX streaming. Another great thing about VLC is that ZIP files don’t need to be separately unpacked to be played, which saves quite time and effort. Although VLC is totally free, its team still keeps upgrading to make better products for users. This open-source software is not so hard to operate. You can successfully use it even though you are a computer novice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6. MacX YouTube Downloader</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reasons to choose:</strong> bulk download available; regular update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Overall rating:</strong> 4.1/5</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MacX YouTube Downloader</strong> is an intuitive video downloader that focuses on video downloading.

It keeps regular updates for bug fixes, so no lags occur when testing this software for video download. You can trust this video downloader if you need to download videos from YouTube without any quality loss.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><a></a>7. Freemake YouTube Video Downloader</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reasons to choose:</strong> free trial; easy access to customer service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Overall rating:</strong> 4.0/5</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Freemake YouTube Video Downloader</strong> has been an efficient download tool for 10 years.

If you want to download high-quality videos using trustworthy software without worrying about its cost, you can give Freemake Video Downloader a try.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8.
