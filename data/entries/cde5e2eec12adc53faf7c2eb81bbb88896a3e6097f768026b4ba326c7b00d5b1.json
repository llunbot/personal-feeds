Since ULA finished assembling the rocket last month, it has been cocooned inside the scaffolding of the company's vertical hangar at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.</p>\n<p>On Friday, ULA's ground crew rolled the Vulcan rocket and its mobile launch platform to its seaside launch pad. It was one of the last steps before the Vulcan rocket is cleared for liftoff Monday at 2:18 am EST (07:18 UTC). On Sunday afternoon, ULA engineers will gather inside a control center at Cape Canaveral to oversee an 11-hour countdown, when the Vulcan rocket will be loaded with methane, liquid hydrogen, and liquid oxygen propellants.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994128#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994128&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cde5e2eec12adc53faf7c2eb81bbb88896a3e6097f768026b4ba326c7b00d5b1","category":"Tech"}
