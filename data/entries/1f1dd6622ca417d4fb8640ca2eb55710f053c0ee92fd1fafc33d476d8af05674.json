This would benefit both mobile developers and users, Epic argued in a wide-sweeping proposal that would greatly limit Google's control over the Android app ecosystem.</p>\n<p>US District Court Judge James Donato will ultimately decide the terms of the injunction. Google has until May 3 to respond to Epic's filing.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016966#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016966&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1f1dd6622ca417d4fb8640ca2eb55710f053c0ee92fd1fafc33d476d8af05674","category":"Tech"}
