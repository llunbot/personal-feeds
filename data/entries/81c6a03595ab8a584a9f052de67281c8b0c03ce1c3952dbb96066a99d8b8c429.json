Infinite Loop served as Apple’s headquarters between \nthe mid-1990s and 2017, when its current Apple Park headquarters \nopened a few miles away. </p>\n\n<p>Apple will be offering all employees at the store the opportunity \nto continue working with the company. A source informed us that at \nleast some employees will be able to relocate to nearby stores, \nincluding the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/retail/appleparkvisitorcenter/\">Apple Park Visitor Center</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/retail/valleyfair/\">Apple Valley \nFair</a>. [...]</p>\n\n<p>The store first opened in 1993 as The Company Store, and it \nfocused primarily on selling Apple-branded merchandise. Following \nrenovations in 2015, it reopened as a more traditional Apple \nretail store, with products like the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch \ndisplayed on beige tables, but it continued to sell a limited \nselection of merchandise, like t-shirts, reusable bottles, mugs, \nand notebooks. The store is one of Apple’s smaller locations, and \nit does not offer Genius Bar appointments or “Today at Apple” \ncreative sessions. </p>\n\n<p>Infinite Loop is a popular attraction for Apple enthusiasts, who \noften make the pilgrimage to the campus and the store. However, \nit has been overshadowed by the Apple Park Visitor Center since \nthat location opened in 2017. A different collection of \nApple-branded merchandise is available for purchase at the Apple \nPark Visitor Center, and the location also serves as a \ntraditional Apple retail store. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I had no idea that the Infinite Loop store carried different merchandise (mainly t-shirts, I’m reliably informed) than the Visitors Center store. I’ve only ever been there once, I think, and it was after the 2015 renovation.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose this isn’t surprising, but you know the original campus is in trouble if <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-infinite-loop-oral-history/\">building IL7</a> closes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageApple/comments/v8v1lz/apple_campus_store_1990s/\">Photos from The Company store in the 1990s</a>, and if you scroll down a few comments, there’s a link to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageApple/comments/iyjvvs/apple_campus_store_199394_the_movie/\">a screen capture of a QuickTime VR walkthrough of the store as it was circa 1994</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/21/apple-infinite-loop-store\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"81c6a03595ab8a584a9f052de67281c8b0c03ce1c3952dbb96066a99d8b8c429","category":"Tech"}
