The first beta was released to developers on Tuesday, September 21. The public beta tests typically follow within a day or so. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big addition in iOS 15.1 and iPadOS 15.1 is the addition of SharePlay. Originally scheduled as part of the iOS 15 launch, it was pushed back to a later software update. Apparently, we’re getting that sooner rather than later. However it’s possible that it gets dropped from the official iOS 15.1 release and pushed back again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>[<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/350966/ios-15-super-guide-features-tips-tricks-updates-safari-facetime-focus-notification-summary.html\">For more tips, guides, and features about iOS 15, check out our iOS 15 Superguide.</a>]</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s new in iOS 15.1</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>SharePlay</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After getting <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/353492/ios-15-macos-monterey-shareplay-delayed-safari.html\">bumped from the original iOS 15 release</a>, SharePlay is back in iOS 15.1. SharePlay lets users watch videos or listen to music together with others on a FaceTime call, with content in sync.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>COVID-19 vaccination record in Wallet</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With iOS 15.1 you’ll be able to add your vaccination record in the Health app. If your heathcare provider already syncs medical records with your Health app, it could already be there. You’ll then be able to add a verified vaccination record card to the Wallet app, with a QR code that can be scanned by whatever institutions want to verify your vaccination status.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t the only way to store your vaccination record on your iPhone. We have a feature showing you <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/353620/iphone-covid-vaccine-passport-app.html\">how to safely store your COVID vaccination card on your iPhone</a> if you don’t have iOS 15.1 yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lossless audio for HomePod</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple previously announced that lossless audio support for Apple Music would be coming to HomePod in iOS 15, but after making an appearance weeks ago in the third iOS 15 beta, it disappeared. Now it’s back. The HomePod beta is invitation only, but <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/21/homepod-15-1-beta-1-brings-back-lossless-and-dolby-atmos-support/&amp;xcust=1-1-358512-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">9to5Mac</a> has confirmed that in the 15.1 beta you can find the option inside the <em>Home Settings</em> of the Home app, then tapping the <em>Apple Music</em> tab.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to download the iOS 15.1 beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a developer, head to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/download/&amp;xcust=1-1-358512-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">developer.apple.com/download/</a> on the device upon which you wish to run the beta.
