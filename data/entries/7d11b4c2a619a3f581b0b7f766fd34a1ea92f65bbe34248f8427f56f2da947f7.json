Extensions can be created to block content, perform message actions, improve security, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/General-macOS-Mail-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nIn turn, Apple said legacy Mail app plug-ins <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/10/macos-monterey-mail-app-extensions/\">would stop functioning</a> in a future macOS release, and it appears that time has now come. AltStore today <a href=\"https://twitter.com/altstoreio/status/1669046033941159938\">said</a> it confirmed with Apple during WWDC last week that plug-ins are not supported on macOS Sonoma, and that MailKit-based extensions are the only supported solution going forward.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>PSA: Confirmed in WWDC labs that legacy Mail plug-ins are NOT supported on macOS Sonoma. MailKit-based extensions are the only supported method going forward.<br /><br />AltServer's Mail plug-in will no longer work once you update, but we're working on a new method we hope to release soon.</p>â€” AltStore.io (@altstoreio) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/altstoreio/status/1669046033941159938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 14, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nWhile MailKit extensions are more secure, they have more limited functionality compared to legacy plug-ins, so not all plug-ins may live on as extensions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLegacy plug-ins cannot be opened in the Mail app as of the first beta version of macOS Sonoma. The update will be released to the public later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613\">@aaronp613</a>!)</em><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/\">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-mail/\">Apple Mail</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/14/macos-sonoma-drops-legacy-mail-app-plug-ins/\">macOS Sonoma Drops Support for Legacy Mail App Plug-ins</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-sonoma-drops-support-for-legacy-mail-app-plug-ins.2392996/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7d11b4c2a619a3f581b0b7f766fd34a1ea92f65bbe34248f8427f56f2da947f7","category":"Apple"}
