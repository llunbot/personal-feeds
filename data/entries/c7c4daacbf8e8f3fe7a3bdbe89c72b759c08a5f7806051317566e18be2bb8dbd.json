We sit on a saddle for hours on end, so a pair of cycling shorts can make or break a ride. They are generally designed to be used between temperatures of 10 degrees C and up, although <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-thermal-bib-shorts\" target=\"_blank\">thermal bib shorts</a> will go cooler and can be paired with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-leg-warmers-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">leg warmers</a>. Specialist bib shorts in particular are often used for temperatures over 30 degrees C.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bib shorts consist of the shorts section, the chamois (or seatpad) and straps that go over the shoulders to help keep everything secure, reducing movement and friction when riding. You can also purchase <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-shorts-with-pockets\" target=\"_blank\">bib shorts with pockets </a>on the rear or the side of the legs, so you can store items if you want to ride in a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-tech-tees-technical-t-shirts\" target=\"_blank\">T-shirt</a> or just bring more <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-much-food-should-i-take-on-a-ride\" target=\"_blank\">food on longer rides</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key factors to look for are comfortable materials used on the legs with appropriate grippers to prevent the shorts from riding up, a good quality chamois with ample support and padding, and bib straps that spread weight over the shoulders without being too warm.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reviews of the best men’s cycling bib shorts</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Q36.5 Dottore Pro bib shorts: </strong>RRP £228 <strong>– <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/q36-5-dottore-pro-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Santini Unico bib shorts: </strong>RRP £178 <strong>– <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/santini-unico-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Castelli Espresso bib shorts: </strong>RRP £160 <strong>– <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/castelli-espresso-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rapha Pro Team PowerWeave bib shorts: </strong>RRP £300 <strong>– <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/rapha-pro-team-powerweave-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Maap Team Evo Cargo bib shorts: </strong>RRP £240 <strong>– <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/maap-team-evo-cargo-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Poc Essential Road VPDS bib shorts:</strong> RRP £160 <strong>– <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/poc-essential-road-vpds-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong> </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Also Consider </h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Sportful SRK bib shorts: </strong>RRP £110 <strong>– <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sportful-srk-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Le Col Hors Categorie II bib shorts: </strong>RRP £210 <strong>– <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/le-col-hors-categorie-ii-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Café Du Cycliste Augustine bib shorts: </strong>RRP £225 <strong>– <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cafe-du-cycliste-augustine-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pas Normal Studios Essential Light bib shorts: </strong>RRP £225 <strong>– <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/pas-normal-studios-essential-light-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Assos Equipe R S9 bib shorts: </strong>RRP £155 <strong>– <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/assos-equipe-r-s9-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>How do we test and why trust our advice? </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-06-x-series-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Pinarello X series\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-06-x-series-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-06-x-series-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-06-x-series-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-06-x-series-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-06-x-series-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-06-x-series-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-06-x-series-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-06-x-series-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-06-x-series.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Pinarello</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All of our product reviewers are avid cyclists who have been riding for many years. They have all built up a huge array of experience from riding in various conditions and testing what kit works and doesn’t work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shorts below were tested between March and June, in a range of different temperatures and weather conditions, on long rides over five hours, to one-hour fast-paced group rides, to virtual races indoors. These rides and conditions over the course of thousands of kilometres allow us to put these shorts through their paces and deliver the good, the bad, and the ugly facts straight to you. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why bib shorts, not shorts? </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/06142036/altura_endurance_shorts_5-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"altura_endurance_shorts_5\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people might be wondering why you should go for bib shorts rather than standard shorts. When we cycle, we usually wear cycling-specific shorts that feature a chamois pad that can aid comfort particularly on longer rides, and also reduce the chance of chafing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bib shorts help with this further by using straps that go over the shoulders to keep the shorts in place and further reduce the chance of irritation, friction and rubbing. The bibs are particularly useful to keep the pad in place through the repeated <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/should-you-sit-or-stand-when-climbing\" target=\"_blank\">standing and sitting</a> typical of a bike ride. They also avoid the need for a waistband, which can cut into you when riding in a semi-crouched position.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What should I look for in bib shorts?  </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few key features to look for in a good pair of bib shorts. The first is the seatpad, as this is what the majority of your comfort when cycling will be down to. Multiple-density foams are good as they provide different levels of support to different areas. Most pressure goes through your sit bones, so additional padding here can be preferable, while less padding around the crotch can help relieve pressure to that area. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also want to ensure the pad suits your type of riding. If you are racing, then more coverage or support at the front may be needed, while for more relaxed riding, a wider seatpad, along with silicone inserts for shock absorption, could provide better support when sitting more upright.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other features to look out for are fast-drying and moisture-wicking materials, as they help regulate temperature, especially in warmer weather. Bib straps that are wide and not too tight will make your rides more comfortable by removing pressure from the shoulders. The type of leg grippers is important to consider as well, since some people can find silicone irritates their skin, while no grippers can lead to shorts rising, bunching and rubbing against skin. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Compressive or not compressive? </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/POCEssential_4-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Poc Essential bib shorts\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/POCEssential_4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/POCEssential_4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/POCEssential_4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/POCEssential_4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/POCEssential_4-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/POCEssential_4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/POCEssential_4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/POCEssential_4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/POCEssential_4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/POCEssential_4-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cycling shorts tend to fall into one of two camps: compressive performance materials, or more supple relaxed fit materials. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/compression-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Compression </a>around the legs has been shown in some studies to improve blood flow and reduce fatigue, which should be ideal for high-intensity training sessions, group rides or races. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However this may not be to everyone’s taste, and for focus on all-day comfort at lower intensity a more supple second-skin feeling material may be preferable. It all depends on the type of riding you intend to use the shorts for.  </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n

€241.97 </h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Packed with innovative tech </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Great levels of comfort and performance </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Environmentally conscious company </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Q36.5 Dottore Pro bib shorts offer something quite special. The compressive elements are great for high-intensity sessions, while the lumbar and gluteal support really do help on long rides in an aggressive position. The material is fast-drying thanks to the addition of silver thread, while the straps are supportive and breathable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chamois is also exceptional with great levels of support across the sit bones and perineum when in a more aggressive position. The low-friction surface and fast drying materials also make it great in warmer weather. The price is high at £228, but perhaps justifiably so given the performance of these shorts. The environmental credentials of the company are also a nice bonus. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/q36-5-dottore-pro-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\">Q36.5 Dottore Pro Bib Shorts review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Q36.5 Dottore Pro Bib Shorts from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alpinetrek.co.uk%2Fq365-dottore-pro-cycling-bottoms%2F\" target=\"_blank\">Alpine Trek (£226.54)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Santini Unico Bib Shorts </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SantiniUnico_1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Santini Unico bib shorts\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SantiniUnico_1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SantiniUnico_1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SantiniUnico_1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SantiniUnico_1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SantiniUnico_1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SantiniUnico_1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SantiniUnico_1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SantiniUnico_1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SantiniUnico_1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/SantiniUnico_1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£178 / $199 / €199 </h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Brilliant comfort with minimal panels </li>\n\n\n\n<li>C3 seatpad is superb </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Great size range </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Santini Unico bib shorts owe a lot of their superb performance to the high thread count, high density fabric, which requires no silicone grippers to keep the legs in place while also being incredibly soft to the touch and highly breathable.

The fabric is very soft to the touch and supremely comfortable while also being very effective at moisture-wicking. The chamois is one of the most comfortable I’ve used thanks to varying foam densities, gel inserts, and channels to aid ventilation and temperature control. This does make the shorts supremely comfortable for long, warm days in the saddle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The straps, however, are a little long, and while they don’t affect the fit when riding, a bigger issue is the leg grippers, which rise up on hairy legs or leg warmers, leading to discomfort. At £210, better leg grippers are needed for these shorts to be the perfect all-day riding short. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/le-col-hors-categorie-ii-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\">Le Col Hors Categorie II Bib Shorts review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Café Du Cycliste Augustine Bib Shorts  </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/CafeDuCycliste_1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cafe du Cycliste Augustine bib shorts\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/CafeDuCycliste_1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/CafeDuCycliste_1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/CafeDuCycliste_1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/CafeDuCycliste_1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/CafeDuCycliste_1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/CafeDuCycliste_1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/CafeDuCycliste_1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/CafeDuCycliste_1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/CafeDuCycliste_1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/CafeDuCycliste_1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£225 / $300 / €230 </h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Superb in hot conditions </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Incredibly lightweight </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sweat patches show through easily </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Café Du Cycliste Augustine bib shorts are brilliant warm weather bib shorts thanks to the incredibly thin, lightweight and supple fabric, which offers great breathability and moisture-wicking. It is also partly made of recycled materials and sourced from within a 100km range to reduce carbon footprint. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Coldblack panel across the back also does help reduce temperature build-up on very sunny days while the perforated straps and front aid temperature regulation. The Elastic Interface chamois is also very comfortable and offers decent support, however it is a touch narrow for me on the sit bones and also towards the front. The fabric also shows sweat very easily, and at £225 this is an expensive pair of bib shorts. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full </strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cafe-du-cycliste-augustine-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Café Du Cycliste Augustine Bib Shorts</strong> <strong>review</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Café Du Cycliste Augustine Bib Shorts from <a href=\"https://www.cafeducycliste.com/en_uk/men-lightweight-bib-shorts-augustine-black.html\" target=\"_blank\">Café Du Cycliste (£225)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pas Normal Studios Essential Light Bib Shorts</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/PNSLightweight_1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Pas Normal Studios Essential Light bib shorts\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/PNSLightweight_1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/PNSLightweight_1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/PNSLightweight_1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/PNSLightweight_1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/PNSLightweight_1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/PNSLightweight_1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/PNSLightweight_1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/PNSLightweight_1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/PNSLightweight_1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/PNSLightweight_1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£225 / $280 / €255 </h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Brilliant moisture-wicking properties </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Useful cargo pocket </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fit is a little loose in places </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pas Normal Studios Essential Lightweight bib shorts are designed primarily around hot weather temperature-management. PNS has come up with a new material that feels papery to the touch and performs brilliantly when it comes to very fast moisture-wicking. This temperature regulation is aided by a similar fabric used on the bib straps as well as a perforated rear panel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chamois pad, PNS own design, is very comfortable and offers a brilliant level of support across a range of positions. The fit is also better than the PNS Mechanism line for all-day comfort and a more relaxed cycling position. However this can lead to a bit of loose fabric, especially around the cargo pocket, which can impact its ability to keep things in on rougher roads. At £225, these are also a very expensive pair of bib shorts. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/pas-normal-studios-essential-light-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\">Pas Normal Studios Essential Light Bib Shorts review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Pas Normal Studios Essential Light Bib Shorts from <a href=\"https://pasnormalstudios.com/uk/products/mens-essential-light-bib-black?currency=GBP&amp;variant=47250675368211\" target=\"_blank\">Pas Normal Studios (£225)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Assos Equipe R S9 Bib Shorts </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/AssosEquipeR_1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Assos Equipe R S9 Bib shorts\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/AssosEquipeR_1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/AssosEquipeR_1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/AssosEquipeR_1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/AssosEquipeR_1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/AssosEquipeR_1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/AssosEquipeR_1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/AssosEquipeR_1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/AssosEquipeR_1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/AssosEquipeR_1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/AssosEquipeR_1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£155 / $205 / €205 </h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Good value </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Great bib straps and sit bone support </li>\n\n\n\n<li>High-volume front can be uncomfortable </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Assos Equipe R S9 bib shorts include many features from the higher spec shorts in the Assos Equipe line, but do so for a big reduction in price. The Type.443 fabric offers good levels of compression for higher-intensity sessions and the shorts were great for fast paced rides and e-races while also being comfortable on the skin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chamois is also great, with the GoldenGate stitching and 3D waffle foam for support and breathability. The only downsides are that the fabric does get very warm in direct sunlight, and the chamois is a little bulky at the front, leading to some slight pressure at times.  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/assos-equipe-r-s9-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\">Assos Equipe R S9 Bib Shorts review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-thermal-bib-shorts\">Best thermal bib shorts reviewed</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-shorts-with-pockets\">Best cycling shorts with pockets 2024: Buyer’s guide to cargo bib shorts</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bib-shorts-with-pee-feature\">Best toilet-friendly cycling shorts 2024: Buyer’s guide to comfort break bib shorts</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-womens-bibshorts-buyers-guide\">Best women’s bib shorts: A buyer’s guide to the best bibs for cycling</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-road-bike-saddles\">Buyer’s guide: the best road bike saddles</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-cycling-bibshorts\">Best cycling shorts: Men’s bib shorts reviewed</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"c7c4daacbf8e8f3fe7a3bdbe89c72b759c08a5f7806051317566e18be2bb8dbd","category":"Cycling"}
