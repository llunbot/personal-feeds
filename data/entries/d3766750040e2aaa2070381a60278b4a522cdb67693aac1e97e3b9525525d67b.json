Now we have an anecdote from Putin himself that highlights how much.</p>\n<p>The story concerns a satellite constellation now known as Sfera (or Sphere, in English), a modestly ambitious constellation of 264 satellites. The Sphere constellation is intended to provide broadband Internet service from middle-Earth orbit to Russia and high-resolution Earth observation satellites.</p>\n<p>As is usual with Russian space projects, because they tend to be poorly funded, the timeline for Sphere's deployment has been delayed and its scope reduced. It also underwent an unscheduled name change. Before 2018, this satellite program was known as Ehfir (Ether), a reference to the invisible substance once thought to fill the universe and the medium through which light waves propagated.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979142#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979142&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d3766750040e2aaa2070381a60278b4a522cdb67693aac1e97e3b9525525d67b","category":"Tech"}
