We want to re-engage with those people and bring some joy and memories back from the 1970s,” says Kidger.</p>\n<h2>Technical (and legal) challenges</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Woman posing with purple Raleigh Chopper.\" title=\"Raleigh Chopper\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Raleigh worked with Sturmey-Archer to develop a new top-tube gear shifter.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Raleigh</i></span></div>\n<p>Raleigh has designed the new Chopper to be as close to the original Chopper MK2 as possible.</p>\n<p>Released in 1972, the Chopper MK2 was the second version of the bike and has become the most desired Chopper, still fetching high prices at auction.</p>\n<p>The new Chopper features many of the same features as the MK2, including the one-piece saddle and mid-frame gear stick. However, achieving these features required work – particularly around the gear shifter.</p>\n<p>“There were some key features on that bike around industrial design and craftsmanship that people did not feel like we could ever do again. We wanted to test the boundaries to see if we could really do it,” explains Kidger.</p>\n<p>Raleigh worked with internal hub gear manufacturer Sturmey-Archer to develop a new version of the gear stick, which is mounted at the top tube and enables riders to shift through the bike’s three <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-gears/\">gears</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Man smiling through frame of red Raleigh Chopper.\" title=\"Raleigh Chopper\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Kidger says Chopper enthusiasts have struggled to tell the difference between the new and older Choppers.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Raleigh</i></span></div>\n<p>Raleigh has had to make some changes to the design of the Chopper to ensure it’s compliant with modern regulations.</p>\n<p>Kidger says one-piece saddles can only have a maximum height of 125mm, so the new saddle is slightly smaller than the MK2’s version.</p>\n<p>Raleigh has had to adjust the design of the Chopper’s bar as well because regulations mean the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-bike-handlebars-guide-how-to-choose-the-right-ones/\">handlebar</a> can’t protrude over the saddle.</p>\n<p>But Kidger says when Raleigh showed the new bike to Chopper enthusiasts, they often mistook the new version for the original.</p>\n<p>“Once they’ve started to really look at the detail, they realise it’s not the MK2. But from a first glance, they all said it was the MK2,” says Kidger.</p>\n<h2>Balancing heritage and practicality</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Man riding red Raleigh Chopper smiling.\" title=\"Raleigh Chopper\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Lee Kidger says Raleigh wants people to rediscover the “contagious joy of cycling”.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Raleigh</i></span></div>\n<p>Kidger says the Chopper created a “movement” in the 1970s, with the bike encapsulating a sense of joy, freedom and fun.</p>\n<p>Designing a new Chopper, which so closely resembles Choppers of old, is a way for Raleigh to help people rediscover what Kidger calls the “contagious joy of cycling”.</p>\n<p>Kidger says this is where releasing heritage models joins up with the more modern side of Raleigh’s business: <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">electric bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>By pulling on the hearts and minds of people in evoking the heritage of the brand through bikes such as the Chopper, Kidger hopes Raleigh will convince people to cycle more.</p>\n<p>In turn, Raleigh’s electric bikes provide practical solutions to facilitate this move to more frequent cycling, and Kidger suggests they could help people take kids to school, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/car-replacement-bike/\">replace a second car</a> and help with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/electric-bikes-could-solve-many-of-our-problems/\">wider issues</a>.</p>\n<p>“Electric bikes are the single biggest benefit to a lot of the challenges the UK faces at the moment, in terms of congestion charges, and net zero and sustainability targets that have come in,” he says.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Man and woman eating ice creams with Raleigh Choppers in foreground.\" title=\"Raleigh Chopper\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Kidger hopes the Chopper will appeal to people’s hearts and minds.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Raleigh</i></span></div>\n<p>Kidger says ebikes provide an opportunity for Raleigh to expand: “We’ve identified that as a real growth area for the business, and we’ve pivoted Raleigh into that emerging market,” says Kidger.</p>\n<p>The brand was bought in 2012 by the Accell Group, one of the biggest electric bike manufacturers and brand owners in Europe.</p>\n<p>It has been adapting to the cargo and electric bike market for a number of years, with ebikes becoming a core part of its business in 2018.
