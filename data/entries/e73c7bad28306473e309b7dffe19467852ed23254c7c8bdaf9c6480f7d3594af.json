Advertising promises that a future without fossil fuels doesn't need to be one without gasoline. But burning petrochemicals, wherever they come from, is still burning petrochemicals, and synthetic fuels come at a cost their supporters aren't talking about.</p>\n<p>We live in perilous times.

We're in this situation because we've spent the better part of two centuries digging up fossil fuels and burning them, putting carbon and other greenhouse gases like methane into the atmosphere and causing significant global warming.</p>\n<p>But even though there's a domino effect to climate change—drought breeds drought as the land cooks and water seeps into the sea, for instance—mathematically, there is still time to act.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931444#p3\">Read 38 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931444&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e73c7bad28306473e309b7dffe19467852ed23254c7c8bdaf9c6480f7d3594af","category":"Tech"}
