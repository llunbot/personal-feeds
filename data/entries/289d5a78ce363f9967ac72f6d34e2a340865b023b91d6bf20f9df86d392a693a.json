One step at a time, one day at a time is all you need to know.’</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Meditative focus </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSA03287-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Woman and bike stood next to Land's End sign\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSA03287-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSA03287-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSA03287-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSA03287-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSA03287-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSA03287-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSA03287-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSA03287-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSA03287-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSA03287-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>James Busby / www.jamesbusbyimages.com</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first leg down to Land’s End went smoothly.

Throughout the entire record Sarah had just eight hours sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her strategy was four hours on the bike, ten minutes off the bike, and the first two days she had an hour and a half of sleep per night. This was then reduced to 15-minute catnaps on the third night, but this pushed things as by day four she was getting confused.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\"
