In fact, there are no longer any devices available in the charity-supporting color option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/PRODUCT-RED-Products.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1312\" height=\"738\" />\r<br />\nSince 2006, Apple has partnered with the (RED) brand to raise money for The Global Fund, an organization that aims to combat diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in Africa. Through this partnership, Apple has long offered a (PRODUCT)RED option for some products, but availability of the color continues to dwindle.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe latest example is the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/\">new iPhone 16e</a>, which is not available in (PRODUCT)RED. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the iPhone SE, iPhone 14, and iPhone 14 Plus now discontinued, the final devices that were available in (PRODUCT)RED are no longer on sale. The only (PRODUCT)RED products that remain available are a few cases for older iPhone models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, Apple has used different branding for newer Beats products available in red, such as Statement Red and Transparent Red.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll in all, (PRODUCT)RED seems to be on its way out, but Apple could always decide to revitalize the partnership in the future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple continues to support The Global Fund through its annual Apple Pay donation program, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/23/apple-pay-donation-campaign-raised-3-million/\">ran from November 29 through December 8</a> last year.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/productred/\">(PRODUCT)RED</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-continues-to-abandon-productred/\">Apple No Longer Offers Any Devices in (PRODUCT)RED Color</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-no-longer-offers-any-devices-in-product-red-color.2449726/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"35ed9edc5c3e07dad31961fafcc4493a205c7039afd885d2ae45669fcb15a935","category":"Apple"}
