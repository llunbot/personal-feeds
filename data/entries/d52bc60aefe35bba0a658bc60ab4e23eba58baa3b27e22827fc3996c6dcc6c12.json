{"title":"Report: Facebook to Change Its Name Next Week to Better Reflect Company's 'Metaverse'","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/20/facebook-changing-name-for-metaverse-goals/","date":1634726477000,"content":"Facebook is reportedly planning to change its name to better reflect Mark Zuckerberg's goal of creating a \"metaverse,\" <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735612/facebook-change-company-name-metaverse\">reports</a> <em>The Verge</em>, claiming the change could come as soon as next week.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Facebook-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the report:\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>The coming name change, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to talk about at the company's annual Connect conference on October 28th, but could unveil sooner, is meant to signal the tech giant's ambition to be known for more than social media and all the ills that entail. The rebrand would likely position the blue Facebook app as one of many products under a parent company overseeing groups like Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, and more. A spokesperson for Facebook declined to comment for this story.</blockquote> Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to shift people's mindset around Facebook, no longer limiting it to just a social media company but to \"being a metaverse company.\" The naming change also comes amid heightened scrutiny on Facebook following a whistleblower sharing several internal documents from the social media company.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>A rebrand could also serve to further separate the futuristic work Zuckerberg is focused on from the intense scrutiny Facebook is currently under for the way its social platform operates today. A former employee turned whistleblower, Frances Haugen, recently leaked a trove of damning internal documents to The Wall Street Journal and testified about them before Congress.</blockquote>As for what Facebook's new name and brand could be, it's not entirely clear. <em>The Verge</em> says that even some of Facebook's own high-ranking leadership executives are not aware of the name, but speculates it could have something to do with \"Horizon.\"\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote> I'm told that the new Facebook company name is a closely-guarded secret within its walls and not known widely, even among its full senior leadership. A possible name could have something to do with Horizon, the name of the still-unreleased VR version of Facebook-meets-Roblox that the company has been developing for the past few years. </blockquote> Facebook's forthcoming change draws stark similarities to 2015 when Google restructured to be under \"Alphabet,\" its holding company that includes Google itself and its subsidiaries. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facebook/\">Facebook</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/20/facebook-changing-name-for-metaverse-goals/\">Report: Facebook to Change Its Name Next Week to Better Reflect Company's 'Metaverse'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-facebook-to-change-its-name-next-week-to-better-reflect-companys-metaverse.2318170/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=d1WWT3FUbl4:ZEV2goFa1YE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=d1WWT3FUbl4:ZEV2goFa1YE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/d1WWT3FUbl4\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d52bc60aefe35bba0a658bc60ab4e23eba58baa3b27e22827fc3996c6dcc6c12","category":"Apple"}
