But not all gravel bike suspension is created equal, so choosing the right suspension system isn’t trivial. In this guide, we’ve collated a range of the best gravel bikes with suspension and, lower down, provide you with pointers to help you to choose. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last few years, there’s been an increasing divergence in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike\">best gravel bikes</a>, with what was once a homogenous do-it-all genre rapidly splitting into <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-race-bikes\">gravel race bikes</a> at one end of a spectrum that extends to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-adventure-bikes\">gravel adventure bikes</a> at the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravel adventure bikes are getting more like mountain bikes, with geometry that’s slacker and longer. And at the extreme end come gravel bikes with suspension, usually with wide tyre clearance and wide gear range too. Read on for our pick of gravel bikes with added bounce.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=NewsletterBanner1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-970x332.webp\" alt=\"'sign up to the cyclist newsletter' banner, saying 'opinions, offers, insights and updates'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-970x332.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-300x103.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-768x263.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-1536x526.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-2048x701.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-750x257.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-1140x390.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reviews of the best gravel bikes with suspension</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>BMC URS – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/bmc-urs-01-three-gravel-bike-review\">Read our full review</a> </strong> </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cannondale Topstone Lefty – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-topstone-lefty-review\">Read our full review</a> </strong> </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Canyon Grizl – Full review of the latest model coming soon</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Giant Revolt X – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/giant-revolt-x-advanced-pro-0-review\">Read our full review</a> </strong> </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lauf Seigla</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pinarello Dogma MX </strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ribble Ultra-Grit – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/ribble-ultra-grit-gravel-bike-review\">Read our full review</a> </strong> </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ridley Ignite GTX</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Specialized Diverge – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-diverge-2025-review\">Read our full review</a> </strong> </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Trek CheckOut</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>YT Szepter – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/yt-szepter-review\">Read our full review</a> </strong> </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why trust Cyclist’s advice?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Cannondale-Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-2025-1-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Cannondale Topstone Carbon Lefty 2025\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Cannondale-Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-2025-1-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Cannondale-Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-2025-1-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Cannondale-Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-2025-1-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Cannondale-Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-2025-1-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Cannondale-Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-2025-1-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Cannondale-Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-2025-1-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Cannondale-Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-2025-1-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Cannondale-Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-2025-1-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Cannondale-Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-2025-1-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Cannondale-Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-2025-1-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Geoff Waugh</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At Cyclist, we bring you reviews of the top bikes across the gravel and road spectrum, along with news and views on bike launches and bike tech. Although we’ve not reviewed all the bikes below, and in some cases we’ve ridden the rigid fork version of a bike that can be bought with a suspension fork, we’ve reviewed a fair crop of gravel bikes with suspension. So we know what to look for and are able to suggest bikes that might suit your requirements if you’re looking to add some extra bump-smoothing to your gravel rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re not paid for our reviews or product placement and all bikes are independently selected by our hugely experienced team, so you can trust Cyclist to bring you unbiased advice.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n

<a href=\"https://de.bmc-switzerland.com/collections/urs-gravel-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">Buy here</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>BMC gives you a choice with its<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/gravel-adventure-and-cyclocross/bmc-urs-gravel-bike-2024\"> URS 01 gravel bike range</a>, as it offers models without front suspension or with a suspension fork or stem. All URS 01 bikes also include the brand’s Micro Travel Technology (MTT) system at the rear. You can also choose a URS bike (without the 01), which has neither front nor rear suspension. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rear MTT offers just 10mm of travel via a tuneable damper between the seatstays and the seat tube. There’s also the option of an MTT suspension fork. This works rather like Specialized’s Future Shock system (see below) and provides 20mm of travel with a tuneable hydraulic damper. Finally, there are URS bikes with an MTT suspension stem, based on the Redshift Sports damped system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We rode the BMC URS 01 Three, which has both the rear and stem MTT suspension elements. BMC’s Gravel+ geometry is more akin to a mountain bike than a road bike, longer and slacker. This led us to push the gravel boundaries into true MTB terrain, where the URS offers confidence and stability. The suspension makes the URS 01 better suited to rides that don’t mix in too much tarmac though.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/bmc-urs-01-three-gravel-bike-review\">BMC URS 01 Three review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cannondale Topstone Carbon Lefty</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"649\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Cannondale-Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-2025-2-970x649.webp\" alt=\"Cannondale Topstone Carbon Lefty 2025\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Cannondale-Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-2025-2-970x649.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Cannondale-Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-2025-2-300x201.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Cannondale-Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-2025-2-768x514.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Cannondale-Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-2025-2-1536x1028.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Cannondale-Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-2025-2-2048x1370.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Cannondale-Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-2025-2-750x502.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Cannondale-Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-2025-2-1140x763.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Cannondale-Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-2025-2-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Cannondale-Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-2025-2-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Geoff Waugh</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>From £6,350 | <a href=\"https://www.sigmasports.com/item/Cannondale/Topstone-Carbon-Lefty-Rival-GX-AXS-Gravel-Bike/14QW7?\" target=\"_blank\">Buy here</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cannondale Topstone Carbon offers 30mm of travel at the rear across the range, thanks to its Kingpin system that, much like the BMC URS, links the seatstays to the seat tube using an elastomer damper. Choose the Lefty though and the front swaps a rigid fork for Cannondale’s distinctive Lefty Oliver single-legged suspension fork, which in the latest generation Topstone has travel increased from 30mm to 40mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lefty fork does have its downsides, as it limits the choice of wheelsets and makes removing the front wheel more complex. On the plus side, you can remove the front tyre without taking the wheel off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale aims the Topstone Lefty at comfort on fast, light gravel rather than singletrack riding, but we found the suspension tech a boon on UK roads, even before we’d hit any gravel. It’s adept on more techy ground too, despite what Cannondale says, although the bike weight of just under 10kg and the added bounce make speed changes and climbing harder. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-topstone-lefty-review\">Cannondale Topstone Carbon Lefty review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Canyon Grizl </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/Canyon-Grizl-lifestyle-1-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/Canyon-Grizl-lifestyle-1-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/Canyon-Grizl-lifestyle-1-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/Canyon-Grizl-lifestyle-1-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/Canyon-Grizl-lifestyle-1-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/Canyon-Grizl-lifestyle-1-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/Canyon-Grizl-lifestyle-1-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/Canyon-Grizl-lifestyle-1-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/Canyon-Grizl-lifestyle-1-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/Canyon-Grizl-lifestyle-1-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/Canyon-Grizl-lifestyle-1-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>From £3,299 | <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/gravel-bikes/adventure/grizl/?showFilters=false&amp;map_prefn1=pc_ebike&amp;map_prefn2=pc_federung_rr&amp;map_prefv1=No&amp;map_prefv2=Yes\" target=\"_blank\">Buy here</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While most specs of the Grizl are sold with a rigid fork, Canyon offers two options with its own 40mm travel Rift suspension fork, developed with DT Swiss.

You can choose from several specs with a mullet drivetrain starting with SRAM Apex mechanical. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read the full details of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/ridley-ignite-gtx\">Ridley Ignite GTX</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Specialized Diverge</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/09/DSC_9199-970x645.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/09/DSC_9199-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/09/DSC_9199-300x199.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/09/DSC_9199-768x511.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/09/DSC_9199-1536x1021.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/09/DSC_9199-2048x1362.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/09/DSC_9199-750x499.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/09/DSC_9199-1140x758.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/09/DSC_9199-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/09/DSC_9199-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/09/DSC_9199-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>From £2,999 | <a href=\"https://www.cyclestore.co.uk/specialized_diverge_4_pro_carbon_gravel_bike_2026-ID_93998?\" target=\"_blank\">Buy here</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While Specialized has discontinued its full-suspension<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-sworks-diverge-str-review\"> Diverge STR</a>, the carbon Diverge continues to offer 20mm of front travel thanks to its Future Shock 3.0 suspension fork.

It’s specced with a RockShox Rudy fork and 1x groupset and has the option of a dropper post. YT hasn’t added the usual luggage mounts, as it aims the bike at gnarly dayrides rather than multi-day escapades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Szepter’s handling on-road feels light and reactive, despite the 10.5kg weight of our test bike. That’s carried over into the woods, with the agility to steer around roots and rocks. It’s a fun bike for a few hours thrashing around the local trails.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>YT was bought from administration and relaunched by its founder, Markus Flossman, at the tail end of 2025. While YT looks to be phasing out the Szepter, it’s still available as of early 2026 in a limited range of sizes and specs.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/yt-szepter-review\">YT Szepter review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What should I consider if I want to buy one?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/giant-revolt-x-advanced-pro-0-review-02-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Giant Revolt X Advanced Pro 0 review\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/giant-revolt-x-advanced-pro-0-review-02-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/giant-revolt-x-advanced-pro-0-review-02-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/giant-revolt-x-advanced-pro-0-review-02-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/giant-revolt-x-advanced-pro-0-review-02-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/giant-revolt-x-advanced-pro-0-review-02-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/giant-revolt-x-advanced-pro-0-review-02-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/giant-revolt-x-advanced-pro-0-review-02-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/giant-revolt-x-advanced-pro-0-review-02-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/giant-revolt-x-advanced-pro-0-review-02.webp 1200w\" /><figcaption>Joseph Branston / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Active vs passive suspension</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost all mountain bikes have active suspension systems, where a suspension fork and, for a full-suspension bike, a rear shock include two parts which slide into one another, with damping to control the travel. They can be tuned to suit your weight, the terrain and your ride style. Many gravel bikes adopt the same type of system, although usually with less travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The disadvantage of active suspension systems is additional weight over a bike without suspension. If you’re riding almost exclusively off-road that might not matter too much, but many gravel rides also take in some metalled roads. Here, the bobbing that can occur can become annoying and sap your energy, as it is translated into up and down motion, rather than moving you forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most active suspension systems include a lock-out so you can stop the bobbing, but then you’re paying extra and carrying additional weight for a capability you’re not using.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alternative is suspension built into the bike itself, such as the BMC URS’s MTT. You can get as much travel as with short-travel active systems, although depending on the design it may not be as tuneable as an active system and may not lock out. There’s a limit to how far passive systems can go too, so if you want longer travel, you’ll need to look at active suspension.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Front-only or front and rear suspension?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re drawn to gravel bike suspension, there’s an argument for considering both front and rear suspension. Adding front-end comfort if your rear end is being hammered around might seem unproductive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, in general, it’s a lot easier to build compliance into a bike’s rear triangle or include a compliant seatpost than it is to build compliance into a rigid fork. Choose a suspension fork only and you’ll save cost, weight, complexity and maintenance and have a greater range of gravel bikes to choose from. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How much travel?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravel bikes typically offer fairly short travel suspension systems relative to mountain bikes, which usually start at around 120mm of front-end travel for XC MTBs and can head up to 200mm or more for downhill bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, most of the initial crop of active travel gravel bike forks offered 30mm travel, although that’s increased to 40mm for many newer gravel suspension forks. There’s typically around the same amount of rear-end travel on gravel bikes with active suspension. But many of the latest crop of monster gravel bikes are equipped with MTB suspension forks, so they match an XC MTB for suspension travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While older gravel bike designs often stopped at around 40mm of tyre clearance, newer gravel bikes are increasingly offering clearance of 50mm or more. Fit a wide <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-gravel-bike-tyres\">gravel tyre</a> or an MTB tyre and you’ll get a significant amount of isolation from the surface, along with roll-over of obstacles which may mean that you don’t need so much suspension travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Suspension fork compensation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the majority of gravel bikes don’t include suspension, many newer framesets are designed so that you can add a suspension fork at a later date. Since a traditional suspension fork such as the RockShox Rudy XPLR requires extra space to accommodate the double crown, it’s longer than a standard rigid fork.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So bikes such as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/argon-18-dark-matter-gravel-bike-review\">Argon 18 Dark Matter</a> and Niner Oro 9 RDO have an extra-long fork and shorter head tube, so that you can swap in a suspension fork without impact on the bike’s geometry or ride characteristics. Several of the bikes above are suspension-compensated and available with either a rigid fork or a suspension fork. It’s something to look for if you think you might want to add a suspension fork at a later date.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+3\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2026/02/Subs-flash-172-for-web-3-new-970x250.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2026/02/Subs-flash-172-for-web-3-new-970x250.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2026/02/Subs-flash-172-for-web-3-new-300x77.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2026/02/Subs-flash-172-for-web-3-new-768x198.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2026/02/Subs-flash-172-for-web-3-new-1536x396.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2026/02/Subs-flash-172-for-web-3-new-2048x528.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2026/02/Subs-flash-172-for-web-3-new-750x193.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2026/02/Subs-flash-172-for-web-3-new-1140x294.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bikes-with-suspension-reviewed\">Best gravel bikes with suspension 2026 reviewed</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"a6f1b3916a227877d8d28b0516302993bbef371392966cab208b99fbc4d95271","category":"Cycling"}
