The program, called the EcoCar EV Challenge, was founded more than three decades ago by the US Department of Energy and is run by the DOE's Argonne National Laboratory.</p>\n<p>Over the last 35 years, more than 30,000 students from 95 universities have participated in the EcoCar Challenge, part of the DOE's Advanced Vehicle Technology Competition. Each segment spans four years, with the most recent cycle beginning in 2023 with a new <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/not-your-grandpas-ride-the-2023-cadillac-lyriq-tested/\">Cadillac Lyriq</a> donated by the General Motors automaker.</p>\n<p>The students take this competition very seriously, as participation alone brings a lot of benefits, including the potential for a lifelong career path.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013389#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013389&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d9fc8d5364f13f16b699c79c27b65f3bb1be69150c3e050bef5a40bdcc6d301f","category":"Tech"}
