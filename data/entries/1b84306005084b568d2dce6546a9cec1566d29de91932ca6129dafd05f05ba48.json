Mechanical issues can and do happen, and being prepared can mean the difference between a quick, easy adjustment in the middle of a ride or ending up stranded in the middle of nowhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you ride road, gravel, mountain bikes, or all of the above, carrying a quality multi-tool is an absolute necessity. When you need to tighten a loose bolt, make a mid-ride adjustment, or fix a broken chain, a good multi-tool is a critical accessory to have when you’re miles from home or the trailhead. And, if you don’t have a full set of bike tools at home, they can be handy for use there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having owned a variety of multi-tools over the years, losing and finding a few (remember to zip up those saddlebags, people), and trying a wide range of the latest models, we gathered 12 of the best multi-tools on the market to test and compare. Each model was tested by review author Jim  Graham or a member of the Bikerumor team for months, and in some cases, years, to help you find the perfect one to match your style of riding and bike repair know-how.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our top bike multi-tool recommendations are listed below, followed by the best of the rest which are great options that we feel are also worthy of consideration. Our <a href=\"#comparison-chart\">comparison chart</a> shows all the models we tested and their specs at a glance, we provide helpful information in our <a href=\"#buying-advice-how-to-choose-a-bike-multi-tool\">buying advice</a> if you need help deciding what you need, and the <a href=\"#frequently-asked-questions\">FAQ section</a> provides answers to some common questions. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Best Bike Multi-Tools of 2023</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Best Overall Bike Multi-Tool: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fsilca-italian-army-knife\">Silca Italian Army Knife – Venti</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Best Budget Bike Multi-Tool: <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/2227671/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPRO-BIKE-TOOL-20-in-1-Bike-Multitool-Compact-Lightweight-with-Slim-Bag%2F564027310&amp;subId1=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool\">Pro Bike Tool 20-in-1</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Runner-Up Best Bike Multi-Tool: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Funior-euro-multi-tool\">Unior Multitool Euro17</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Best Bike Multi-Tool for Mountain Biking: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F172446%2Ftopeak-mini-pt-30-multi-tool%3Fcolor%3DNONE\">ToPeak Mini PT30</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Best Bike Multi-Tool for On-Bike Storage: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fblackburn-big-switch-wrap\">Blackburn Switch Wrap Tool Kit</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Best Bike Multi-Tool for Durability: <strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F746199%2Fcrankbrothers-m19-multi-tool%3Fcolor%3DGOLD\">Crankbrothers M19</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Best Bike Multi-Tool with Tubeless Plugs: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8JVDWP9/?tag=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool-20\">Cannondale 18-in-1 with Dynaplug</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest Overall Bike Multi-Tool\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fsilca-italian-army-knife\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSilca Italian Army Knife – Venti\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$55</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Measured Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>177g</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Number of Functions</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>20</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Hex Keys</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Torx</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>T8, T10, T20 and T25</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Screwdrivers</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Phillips #2 and flat head</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Other Tools</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Chain tool, master-link storage, 7mm box wrench, 8mm flare nut wrench, 10mm open wrench, disc pad spreader, Presta valve core remover;

As is typical of all their products, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fsilca-italian-army-knife\">Silca Venti</a> is one ingeniously designed, rugged, and artfully crafted tool that we kept coming back to when we debated which multi-tool deserved our “Best Overall” rating.</p><p></p><p>The Venti is everything you’d want in a tool for road, mountain bike, or gravel cycling. It’s sturdy, feature-packed, small, easy to access, and solid in your hand. The side plates are textured for extra grip in sweaty palms and it has great ergonomics for a tool of this style. Like any good bike multi-tool, the Italian Army Knife comes loaded with all the hex sizes you’ll likely ever need while riding from 2mm to 8mm, along a whopping 4 Torx sizes (T8, T10, T20, and T25), and Phillips and flat head screwdrivers. The forged bits are also plated with a type of chrome that gives them better grip, or bite, on the heads of stubborn bolts.</p><p></p><p>Look closely, and you’ll find some other clever little touches in the Venti. The removable chain tool handle is much larger than most making it solid for grasping and easier to handle when working on a chain. It also serves as a spoke wrench, valve core remover, 10mm nut wrench, and disc pad spreader. Inside the side plates, there’s a nifty storage space with magnets that can hold a master link for most chains. And, if you don’t have a master link, the conventional chain tool makes fixing a broken chain as easy as it can be when you’re out on a ride.</p><p></p><p>At 177 grams, it isn’t a featherweight, but it certainly won’t weigh you down, and its reasonably compact size makes it easy to stash in your saddlebag, jersey pocket, or fanny pack. At $55, it isn’t exactly cheap either, but the <a

Bike Tool 20-in-1</a> offers great value in a compact multi-tool with a nice range of functions to cover most needs. Its slim, sleek, compact design and carrying case make it easy to tuck into a saddle bag or fit very comfortably against your back in a jersey pocket, and its chromed steel construction feels strong and smooth in the hand. </p><p></p><p>The 20-in-1 has a decidedly polished look and feel, with 20 total functions that fold down into a super slim and compact form that is very lightweight at just 118 grams. The small storage sleeve also does a great job of keeping the tool tidy when not in use so the bits aren’t flipping open or snagging on other things in your pockets or pack. </p><p></p><p>It covers all the common functions necessary for most mid-ride fixes and adjustments, including a chain tool, hex keys between 2 and 8mm, T25 and T30 Torx bits, and Phillips and flathead screwdrivers. One nice touch: Each tool has its size stamped on the side, which helps in quickly selecting the right tool for the job. Like most multi-tools, the bits are on the short side, which can make accessing tight, small spaces tricky; and we found that the small, chromed chain tool was short and slippery, which made gripping it for the high-torque task of breaking a chain slightly challenging. </p><p></p><p>At $29, the <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/2227671/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPRO-BIKE-TOOL-20-in-1-Bike-Multitool-Compact-Lightweight-with-Slim-Bag%2F564027310&amp;subId1=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool\">Pro Bike Tool 20-in-1</a> is the least expensive model we tested and still provides the tools and functions most riders need in a compact and lightweight package.

Unior is based in Slovenia, a small European country that’s also produced some of the world’s top cyclists, including Grand Tour winners Primoz Roglic and Tadej Pogacar, and they make some of the best workshop tools on the market.</p><p></p><p>Slovenia’s passion for cycling is reflected in the Unior Euro17’s design: simple, functional, durable, and precision-made. Its selection of 17 tools can handle the most common repairs and adjustments you’d face on any type of ride. It contains hex sizes between 2 and 8mm, the 2 most common Torx sizes (T10 and T25), a good chain tool, Phillips and flathead screwdrivers, several spoke wrench sizes, and valve core removers. Additionally, the way this tool folds means those tools are longer than most to get to harder-to-reach bolts, and the heads have black oxide tips for enhanced durability. </p><p></p><p>At 175 grams, it isn’t exactly heavy, though it isn’t a featherweight, nor is it the most compact. That said, it still easily fits in a jersey pocket, saddle bag, or pack, and feels great in the hand for a solid grip and leverage on stubborn bolts. The tools are also easy to identify and deploy for quick fixes and adjustments.

Perhaps even more impressive than the number of functions is how ToPeak packed them all into such a compact multi-tool. The Mini PT30 is smaller than many options that have significantly fewer tools while being respectably lightweight at 173 grams. </p><p></p><p>While it is a great option for any type of cycling, we think it would be especially handy off-road, where cyclists are more apt to need the tire plug (doesn’t come with plugs) and master link storage and tools. It also has the most hex wrench sizes, with 2 to 8mm and the addition of a 10mm that fits over the top of the 8mm head. Three Torx wrenches (T10, T15, and T25), Phillips and flathead screwdrivers, a disc spreader, a chain tool and chain hook, several spoke wrench sizes, and even a small, lockable knife blade round out the tool selection. The tools are made from Chrome Vanadium (CrV) steel for added strength and corrosion resistance, and most are marked with their size for easy identification.</p><p></p><p>While most multi-tool cases don’t add a lot of value, the Mini PT30’s neoprene case is well made and keeps it super tidy. The tool feels quite comfortable against your body in your jersey or cargo-bibs pocket and will keep it from rattling around in a saddle bag or hydration pack. And if you want something similar but a little smaller, lighter, and without the tubeless tools, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003FXQD6E/?tag=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool-20\">ToPeak Mini 20 Pro</a> is a solid option.</p><p></p><p>The only real drawbacks to the Mini PT30 are that with so many tools packed into such a compact size, the bits are on the short side and some of the tools are tricky to use. For example, the L-shaped 2mm hex is fairly awkward to operate, and likewise for the master-link tool.

Switch Wrap Tool Kit</a>, and you may ask yourself, “Who needs a saddlebag?” In addition to the handy multi-tool that is stored inside it, the Switch Wrap is designed to hold everything that most cyclists will stash in a separate saddlebag or throw in a fanny pack: a spare inner tube, one or two tire levers, a couple of CO2 canisters, and a CO2 inflator. And you could probably fit a few more things inside. Bonus: The wrap is designed to be attached snuggly either under your saddle or on a frame tube, saving you from either carrying weight on your back or needing to buy a saddlebag altogether.</p><p></p><p>Though the wrap design makes it a little more time-consuming to deploy the tools, the Switch Wrap comes with a solid selection for most trail or roadside fixes and adjustments. While not a traditional, fold-out multi-tool, the kit includes multiple dual-headed bits that fit into a handle that functions either as a T or L-shaped grip as well as a bit extender. This provides excellent ergonomics, great leverage, and options to access hard-to-reach places that folding tools often can’t. </p><p></p><p>The caveat is that the bits are all separate, so can misplace them or drop them in the dirt if you aren’t careful. The chain tool is on the short side and hard to grip while removing a rivet (a common issue with small multi-tools), but it was certainly functional and adequate for fixing a chain mid-ride. You’ve also got to pull the whole wrap off the bike every time you need to access any of the tools. </p><p></p><p>Still, if you’re looking for a handy solution to carry your tools and other repair essentials such as a tube, CO2, and tire levers on the bike instead of your back, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fblackburn-big-switch-wrap\">Blackburn Switch Wrap Tool Kit</a> is a fantastic option.

One of our testers has had one of the super durable M-Series tools since 2002, and, while it has a bit of corrosion on the bits, it’s still going strong. Longevity like that is hard to come by these days, and at $33 to $37 (depending on the color), it makes the M19 an outstanding value. </p><p></p><p>The overall design of the Cranksbrothers M-series multi-tools hasn’t changed much over the years. They’ve still got the timeless, industrial look of the original versions with perhaps the biggest change being the texture added to the side plates for enhanced grip. It’s a great size that fits nicely in the palm, and the tools are a reasonable length for reaching most common bolts. It even comes with a “tool flask”, a slim metal case to contain it and keep it tidy in your pocket or pack (though it adds approximately 40 grams of weight). </p><p></p><p>With 19 functions, the M19 has pretty much all of your tool needs covered. Hex sizes 2 to 8mm, T10 and T25 Torx bits, a chain tool, 2 sizes of Phillps and a flathead screwdriver, and 4 spoke wrenches integrated into the chain tool.

This slender and lightweight tool (just 125 grams) boasts 18 functions including a fold-out Dynaplug tubeless plugger that comes loaded with two of their plugs. Having used virtually every tubeless plug on the market, we feel that Dynaplug are some of the best. </p><p></p><p>For such a small tool, Cannondale really packed the functions into the 18-in-1. It has hex sizes between 2 and 8mm, a T25 Torx bit, Phillips #2, and flathead screwdrivers. The chain tool also has 3 sizes of spoke wrenches, magnetic quick-link storage, and works as a disc pad spreader and bottle opener. The star of the show is the addition of Dynaplug, a reversible dual-headed plugger that comes preloaded with 2 plugs. These short metal-tipped plugs are super quick and easy to use and seal small punctures better than other plugs in our experience. </p><p></p><p>Like similarly sized tools, the Cannondale 18-in-1 has relatively short bits that may make it hard to reach certain bolts. The 8mm hex also nests on top of the 5mm, so it is possible to lose it if you aren’t careful, and the chain tool needs to be removed from the tool to use it as well. There’s also the price, which at $80 ($60 from Amazon at the time of publishing) sounds like a lot. When you consider, however, that standalone Dynaplug kits cost around $60, that doesn’t seem so bad. </p><p></p><p>If you’re a fan of Dynaplugs and want an all-in-one multi-tool and tubeless plug solution, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8JVDWP9/?tag=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool-20\">Cannondale 18-in-1 with Dynaplug</a> should definitely be on your list. It’s got all the tools you need for most fixes in a slim profile at a lightweight that makes it a no-brainer for any type of riding. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8JVDWP9/?tag=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best of the Rest</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tA Great Tool With Individual Hex Keys\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fblackburn-wayside-multi-tool\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBlackburn Wayside\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$40</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Measured Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>195g</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Number of Functions</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>19</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Hex Keys</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 5mm removable L-bend ball-end wrenches and 6 and 8mm hex wrenches</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Torx</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>T25 and T30</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Screwdrivers</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Flathead</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Other Tools</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Chain tool, 0, 1, and 2 spoke wrenches, Presta valve core tool, disc pad spreader, serrated knife blade, breaker bar function</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Wayside.jpeg\">\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"622\" height=\"415\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Wayside.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Multi-Tools of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Wayside.jpeg 622w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Wayside-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Wayside-120x80.jpeg 120w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Removable ball-end hex wrenches</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Chain tool with assembly hook</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Disc brake pad spreader</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Sharp knife</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No Phillips head screwdriver</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Limited Torx sizes</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>A little heavier than some</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fblackburn-wayside-multi-tool\">Blackburn Wayside</a> feels like it was designed and built by off-road cyclists who know not only what tools you’ll need, but how you’ll actually use them. The range of seven hex tool sizes is impressive, but what really stands out for us is that five of them are removable and have ball ends, which means they’re much easier to fit into and use in hard-to-reach spaces. The beefy 8mm hex key attached to the tool also works as a mini breaker bar, or extender, that the smaller, detachable hex keys fit into for added leverage.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the Wayside is similar to other multi-tools with tools that fold out including 6 and 8mm hex keys, T25 and T30 Torx bits, a flathead screwdriver, a chain tool, and even a long-ish serrated knife blade. The chain tool has integrated 0, 1, and 2 spoke wrenches and a Presta valve core removal tool. Although the chain tool is a little on the short side, working with it is made easier thanks to a wire chain hook that holds your chain in place for removing or adding a link. The chain tool has another redeeming quality: a brake disc pad spreader. It makes simple work of resetting a disc brake; a common issue when removing wheels for transportation and pressing the brake levels accidentally. </p><p></p><p>The Wayside is a bit larger than in size than similar tools, so it takes up a bit more storage space in your pocket or pack. That said, it feels good in your hand and is easier to grasp than some of the pint-sized competition. It’s also a tad heavier than many of the other models we tested, a tradeoff for the awesome removable hex keys.</p><p></p><p>At $40, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fblackburn-wayside-multi-tool\">Blackburn Wayside</a> is a great option for the rider who wants the functionality of individual hex keys in a well-designed multi-tool they can take anywhere on the go.

The kit actually includes three stackable multi-tools held together by magnets (all of which are sold separately too), providing 26 functions (give or take depending on how you count) that cover just about any repair that doesn’t require a bike shop. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F205078%2Fwolf-tooth-components-8-bit-pack-pliers-bike-multi-tool%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">8-Bit Pack Pliers</a> ($69.95 sold separately) are the backbone of the kit with 17 functions on its own. These master-link pliers have eight attachments magnetically nested inside the handles that fit into an 8mm swivel head on the end. The bits include 2 through 8mm hex keys, T10 and T25 Torx bits, Phillips #2 and flathead screwdrivers, a spoke wrench and valve core tool, and a valve cleaning rasp. The other side of the tool is the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F208112%2Fwolf-tooth-components-8-bit-chainbreaker-knife-multi-tool%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">8-Bit Chainbreaker + Utility Knife</a> ($69.95 sold separately) that has both of its namesake tools plus a tire plug inserter, storage for tire plugs, a master-link, and a valve core, and a 16mm hex.

It’s fairly long but well-contained to keep its size quite reasonable for the tools available, and it’s shockingly lightweight at just 172 grams. It’s also beautifully machined and sturdy, as we’ve come to expect from Wolf tooth products.</p><p></p><p>We chose this as the best tool for bikepacking and far-flung adventures where you might be very far from civilization because of the wealth of tools offered for handling tricky fixes. Sure, it takes some fiddling around to remove the separate bits from the handle compared to a conventional multi-tool, and the bits are also black, which makes them potentially easier to lose in the dirt or at night.

href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PH2F9G8/?tag=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool-20\">ToPeak Ratchet Rocket Lite DX+</a> would be a sweet multi-tool to have in hand. Its fine-toothed reversing ratchet works like a miniature version of a shop tool and makes tightening nuts and bolts a breeze.</p><p></p><p>The ratchet’s handle design allows bits to be driven three ways: at a right angle, with an extension, and in a straight, screwdriver-like configuration. We found that it fits into tight, awkward spaces better than any tool we tested and made quick work of adjustments. It offers a good range of solid steel bits including the normal hex sizes between 2 and 8mm, 3 Torx bits (T10, T15, and T25), and a Phillips head screwdriver. It also comes with a quality chain tool and two tire levers.</p><p></p><p>We’re not generally fans of loose bits for multi-tools, because they’re so easy to drop and lose, especially on trails and in low-light conditions. But the DX+ case holds the bits securely and features a little pouch that’s perfect for holding a couple of spare bits, a tire patch, and a $20 bill for emergencies. The case also makes it relatively comfortable to carry and slide into a pack, and the 195-gram weight is super reasonable for what it is.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PH2F9G8/?tag=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool-20\">ToPeak Ratchet Rocket Lite DX+</a> is a well-executed ratcheting tool kit that can easily be brought along on rides, taken on bike trips, and/or work well as an addition to the home workshop. At $53, it’s also competitively priced and brings something unique to the table compared to more traditional options.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PH2F9G8/?tag=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tLightweight With Tubeless Repair Tools\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FLezyne-SV-Pro-17-Multitool\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLezyne SV Pro-17\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$50</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Measured Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>119g</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Number of Functions</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>17</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Hex Keys</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>2, 3, 4, 5, and 6mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Torx</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>T10 and T25</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Screwdrivers</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Phillips</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Other Tools</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Chain tool, 1, 2, and 3 spoke wrenches, 8 and 10 open wrenches, valve core tool, tubeless needle and plug carrier with plugs.</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lezyne-SV-Pro-17.jpeg\">\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1945\" height=\"1297\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lezyne-SV-Pro-17.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Multi-Tools of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lezyne-SV-Pro-17.jpeg 1945w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lezyne-SV-Pro-17-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lezyne-SV-Pro-17-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lezyne-SV-Pro-17-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lezyne-SV-Pro-17-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lezyne-SV-Pro-17-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lezyne-SV-Pro-17-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lightweight</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Small size</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Covers the basics</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Includes plugs and plugger</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No flathead screwdriver or 8mm hex</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Compact size limits leverage</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>One of the benefits of riding a high-quality, well-maintained bike is that breakdowns are generally less frequent and easier to fix when you’re in the middle of a ride. Sometimes the best option for some riders is the smallest and lightest tool they can find. We think the <a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FLezyne-SV-Pro-17-Multitool\">Lezyne SV Pro-17</a> would be an excellent choice for cyclists looking for a lightweight, compact, high-quality tool that can handle the occasional mechanical or flat tubeless tire without a lot of fuss or delay.</p><p></p><p>This stainless steel, 17-function tool feels finely machined and solidly made, with a nice mix of the most common tools. With hex sizes between 2 and 6mm, T10 and T25 Torx bits, and a Phillips screwdriver, it should have everything to handle most riders’ needs. The chain breaker is on the small side, but it’s something most road riders will seldom, if ever, use and is certainly adequate for an emergency roadside fix. One touch we liked: a tubeless needle and plug holder with a few bacon strips included – a feature that will save you from fishing around in your saddlebag for a separate tubeless tire repair kit.</p><p></p><p>At 119 grams, the Lezyne SV Pro-17 weighs almost nothing and its compact size, held together neatly with a stretchy rubber band to keep it tidy, means it easily fits in your jersey pocket or saddle bag and goes virtually unnoticed until you need it. While it would be great if it had an 8mm hex and quick link storage, Lezyne makes a huge range of other tools like the <a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FLezyne-SUPER-V-22-Hex-Torx-Screwdriver-Bicycle-Multi-Tool\">Super V</a> and Super SV that include them and more. They also make smaller and lighter versions of the V Pro that have between 5 and 13 tools for those with other needs.</p><p></p><p>Still, the <a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FLezyne-SV-Pro-17-Multitool\">Lezyne SV Pro-17</a> is a well-made and versatile tool that can handle most trails and road riders’ needs, including tubeless repairs. Its got a clean look, quality feel, and its lightweight and compact size makes it easy to forget about until you need it.</p><p></p><p>You can find out more about the <a

F15</a>, is a sleek, compact multi-tool that can handle basic adjustments and repairs, and packs easily into a saddle bag or pocket. It’s a great choice for road bikes, which take less punishment than mountain or gravel bikes and typically require far fewer mid-ride stops for mechanicals.</p><p></p><p>With 15 functions, this is an ideal tool for a quick stop to tighten a loose bolt, adjust your saddle or handlebars, or align a chattering derailleur. Overall, it’s a good, solid, simple tool for most cyclists and the most common mechanicals. With all the common hex keys between 2 and 8mm, a T25 Torx bit, and Phillips and flathead screwdrivers, it should cover the bolts on most people’s bikes. The chain tool also houses 4 sizes of spoke wrenches. </p><p></p><p>The Pro Multi-Tool’s sleek carrying case doubles as an ergonomic handle that fits well in the hand and provides solid leverage for the tools. It also keeps it sleek and well-organized for stashing in a pack or saddle bag, or for comfort in a jersey pocket.

ride or cutting it short, so we always carry one with us no matter where we’re going or what type of bike we’re riding. We can’t even count the number of times our multi-tools have been used over the years for everything from simple comfort adjustments, fixing chains, or tightening bolts that mysteriously came loose during a ride. And, we’re always seeking the best tool for the job, whether that’s a super lightweight option for races or a more comprehensive model for heading way off the grid on overnight adventures. Thankfully, we get to try out a lot of different multi-tools, so we can share our experience with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For our bike multi-tools buyer’s guide, review authors Jim Graham and Jeremy Benson personally tested each of the 12 models included. Jim is an avid gravel rider who spends lots of time exploring the backroads of New England and knows the importance of having the right multi-tool while riding through remote forests on rough roads. He’s been cycling for many years and has used many different multi-tools in that time. He’s semi-retired from a career in journalism, but he’s keeping himself busy testing and reviewing gear including <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-best-gravel-bike-tires/\">the best gravel bike tires</a>. Jeremy has been professionally testing and reviewing bike gear for over seven years. He’s a gravel and mountain bike racer who spends an inordinate time on the bike testing products, training, and riding for fun. In addition to testing over 30 multi-tools in the past few years, he’s constantly making mid-ride adjustments while testing everything from complete bikes, pedals, and shoes, and has come to appreciate the quality multi-tools that help to make his life easier. Jeremy has also provided his expertise in testing and reviewing the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-hitch-bike-racks/\">best hitch bike racks</a>, protective <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-helmet/\">mountain bike helmets</a>, and our <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-shoes/\">favorite mountain bike shoes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After researching the best bike multi-tools on the market, we rounded up a diverse selection of 12 models for side-by-side testing and comparison. Each tool was weighed for consistency and comparison to manufacturers’ specs and examined to check the design and build quality. We shoved each multi-tool into jersey pockets, saddle bags, and fanny packs to analyze their portability, and took them out on rides of varying lengths in the off chance we might need to use them in the field. We also ran each model through a series of tests in the home workshop to test their ergonomics, the functionality and durability of all the tools, and to use features like chain tools, quick link storage, quick link tools, disc pad spreaders, and, of course, bottle openers. When testing concluded, we zeroed in on our favorites and those that excel in specific ways compared to the rest.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tools-testing-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tools-testing-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Using the Cannondale 18-in-1 with Dynaplug to tighten a thru-axle on a mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tools-testing-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tools-testing-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tools-testing-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tools-testing-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tools-testing-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tools-testing-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tools-testing-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tools-testing-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>There’s no substitute for real-world testing, so we ran each model through a series of tests to see how well they work and compare to each other.

But answering this question will go miles toward simplifying your search: How will you actually use a multi-tool?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost every multi-tool we’ve ever tried will handle the most common, basic repairs and tweaks on a road, gravel, mountain, or e-bike – adjusting a saddle or handlebars or tightening a loose bolt. So, think about your bike mechanic skills before you buy. In addition to the basics, do you know how to adjust a derailleur? Re-center your disc brakes? Fix a broken chain? True a warped wheel? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing how to use the tools is just as important as having them, so taking a bike maintenance or repair course could be a great way to learn new skills that may come in handy down the road or trail. There are also great tutorial videos you can find online to figure out how to fix certain things (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@parktool\"><strong>Park Tool</strong></a> has great how-to videos).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-group-shot-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-group-shot-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Group shot of bike multi-tools\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-group-shot-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-group-shot-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-group-shot-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-group-shot-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-group-shot-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-group-shot-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-group-shot-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-group-shot-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>There are a lot of options when it comes to multi-tools. Thankfully, there’s something out there that will be suited to your specific needs, even if finding it might be a challenge. (photo/Jim Graham)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Tools Do You Need?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking some time to familiarize yourself with your bike(s) and all the parts can give you a good idea of what tools you need to make adjustments out on a ride. It pays to know the specific hex sizes, Torx bits, and screw heads your particular bike requires. For instance, some derailleurs, such as the Shimano GRX, take a small, 2mm hex wrench – not included on some multi-tools – to adjust the limit screws. And, depending on the tools your bike needs, know that many brands make several versions with varying tools included so you should be able to find one that suits your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may sound obvious, but your multi-tool should suit the adjustments and fixes you’re comfortable making. If you’ll use it only to make occasional, quick, and easy repairs during a ride, then look for these common features:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hex (aka Allen) wrenches in 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A Phillips and/or flathead screwdriver</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Torx wrenches that fit your bike (the most common are T10 and T25)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A chain tool (assuming you know how to use it)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The above selection of hex, Torx, and screwdrivers should be able to handle most of the simple adjustments and fixes that most well-maintained bikes will require on a ride. There’s a reason that every model in this review has a chain tool, and that is because it is pretty critical in the off chance you break a chain during a ride, but you have to know how to use it for it to be effective. While it doesn’t happen that often, it does happen, and even if you carry a quick link (or master link) to rejoin your broken chain, the broken section of the chain almost always needs to be removed to install it. Again, watching an instructional video and/or practicing at home on an old chain can be the difference between making a fix in the field and continuing your ride, walking out of the woods, or calling your significant other for a roadside pickup. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Silca-Venti-chain-tool-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Silca-Venti-chain-tool-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"The chain tool on the Silca Italian Army Knife Venti\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Silca-Venti-chain-tool-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Silca-Venti-chain-tool-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Silca-Venti-chain-tool-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Silca-Venti-chain-tool-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Silca-Venti-chain-tool-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Silca-Venti-chain-tool-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Silca-Venti-chain-tool-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Broken chains don’t happen that often, but you need a chain tool to fix one.

Lots of bike multi-tools include other functions than the essentials listed above including things like quick-link storage, valve core tools, spoke wrenches, disc pad spreaders, disc rotor truing tools, knife blades, tubeless repair tools, plugs, and more. To be self-sufficient, it’s important to have the tools you need to keep your bike rolling. One of the most comprehensive tools we tested is the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F226064%2Fwolf-tooth-components-8-bit-kit-two-bike-multi-tool-set%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Wolf Tooth 8-Bit Kit Two</a> which would be our pick for extended bikepacking trips where you might not see people for days.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Wolf-Tooth-8-bit-plugs-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Wolf-Tooth-8-bit-plugs-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"A closer look at the components of the Wolf Tooth 8-bit kit two including the tire plugs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Wolf-Tooth-8-bit-plugs-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Wolf-Tooth-8-bit-plugs-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Wolf-Tooth-8-bit-plugs-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Wolf-Tooth-8-bit-plugs-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Wolf-Tooth-8-bit-plugs-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Wolf-Tooth-8-bit-plugs-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Wolf-Tooth-8-bit-plugs-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Wolf-Tooth-8-bit-plugs-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The super comprehensive Wolf Tooth 8-Bit Kit Two includes a pack of bacon strips and a tire plug insertion tool.

While tubeless plug and plug tools have traditionally been something we carry independently of our multi-tools, many models are now coming with them integrated into their designs for an all-in-one tool and tubeless repair kit. Not every multi-tool comes with tubeless tools or plugs, of course, but many do and some brands offer multiple models that come with or without to suit varying needs and preferences. These features often consist of a tubeless needle/plugger that can be used to push a “bacon strip” into a puncture and storage space for some tubeless plugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Cannondale-Dynaplug-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Cannondale-Dynaplug-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Dynaplug feature on the Cannondale 18-in-1 with Dynaplug bike mutli-tool\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Cannondale-Dynaplug-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Cannondale-Dynaplug-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Cannondale-Dynaplug-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Cannondale-Dynaplug-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Cannondale-Dynaplug-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Cannondale-Dynaplug-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Cannondale-Dynaplug-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Cannondale-Dynaplug-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Dynaplugs work great in our experience, so having them integrated into a tool like the Cannondale 18-in-1 with Dynaplug means there’s one less thing we need to carry.

The ToPeak, Lezyne, and Wolf Tooth all have plug insertion tools for “bacon strip” type plugs and the latter two models even come with some. The Cannondale tool comes with a dual-head Dynaplug tool and their easy-to-use pointed metal tip plugs. Plug preferences vary, of course, with some riders swearing by bacon strips and others preferring Dynaplug or other options.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-ergonomics-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-ergonomics-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Using the ToPeak Mini PT30 to tighten a bolt\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-ergonomics-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-ergonomics-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-ergonomics-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-ergonomics-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-ergonomics-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-ergonomics-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-ergonomics-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-ergonomics-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The length of the bits and size of many folding tools can impact their ergonomics and your ability to reach certain bolts with them. (photo/Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ergonomics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to regular workshop tools, most multi-tools sacrifice a bit in ergonomics for the compact form that they need to take to pack many tools into a portable and lightweight unit. This is particularly true of most folding tools that have short, folding bits and rectangular shapes. They typically feel pretty good in your hands and provide adequate torque for simple fixes or adjustments, but the length of the bits and the shape of the tool itself can often mean that accessing hard-to-reach bolts is awkward. Still, they can get the job done <em>most</em> of the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Switch-Wrap-ergonomics-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Switch-Wrap-ergonomics-1-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The tools inside the Blackburn Switch Wrap Tool Kit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Switch-Wrap-ergonomics-1-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Switch-Wrap-ergonomics-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Switch-Wrap-ergonomics-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Switch-Wrap-ergonomics-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Switch-Wrap-ergonomics-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Switch-Wrap-ergonomics-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Switch-Wrap-ergonomics-1-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Switch-Wrap-ergonomics-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>They may be a little slower to deploy, but the tools in the Blackburn Switch Wrap Tool Kit have excellent ergonomics compared to more traditional folding multi-tools.

Fortunately, they are typically relatively lightweight and compact, so most will be easy to stash in a jersey or cargo bib pocket, saddle bag, hydration pack, fanny pack, bottle mount tool canister, or in-frame storage compartment. But, some are smaller and lighter than others, making them easier to squeeze into a small saddle bag or be less noticeable in your pocket. Some even have storage cases to keep them tidy and feeling pleasant against your lower back or keep them from snagging on other things in your pack. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Multi-tool-portability-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Multi-tool-portability-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"A bike multi-tool being carried in a saddle bag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Multi-tool-portability-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Multi-tool-portability-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Multi-tool-portability-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Multi-tool-portability-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Multi-tool-portability-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Multi-tool-portability-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Multi-tool-portability-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Multi-tool-portability-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Saddle bags are a common spot to carry a multi-tool on road and gravel bikes.

Not surprisingly, however, the two lightest models we tested, the <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/2227671/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPRO-BIKE-TOOL-20-in-1-Bike-Multitool-Compact-Lightweight-with-Slim-Bag%2F564027310&amp;subId1=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool\">Pro Bike Tool 20-in-1</a> and the <a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FLezyne-SV-Pro-17-Multitool\">Lezyne SV Pro-17</a>, also happen to be a couple of the slimmest and most compact, making them quite easy to fit into small spaces. Also not surprisingly, a few of the heaviest models we tested, like the Blackburn Wayside and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F226064%2Fwolf-tooth-components-8-bit-kit-two-bike-multi-tool-set%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Wolf Tooth 8-Bit Kit Two</a>, are some of the largest. The added weight and size, however, is a tradeoff for extra or specialized tools and better ergonomics and leverage.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Switch-Wrap-portability-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Switch-Wrap-portability-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Blackburn Switch Wrap Tool Kit mounted on a mountain bike on a mountaintop\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Switch-Wrap-portability-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Switch-Wrap-portability-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Switch-Wrap-portability-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Switch-Wrap-portability-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Switch-Wrap-portability-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Switch-Wrap-portability-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Switch-Wrap-portability-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackburn-Switch-Wrap-portability-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>This Blackburn Switch Wrap has been in use for 3+ years and it attaches neatly to the frame holding a spare tube, two CO2 canisters, and a tire lever. It can also be attached to the saddle in place of a saddle bag. (photo/Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are many ways to store tools on bikes themselves these days, one of the best we’ve found is the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fblackburn-big-switch-wrap\">Blackburn Switch Wrap Tool Kit</a>. Not only does it include a solid tool selection, but the wrap can hold additional items like a tube, CO2 canisters, tire plugs, and tire levers and be strapped to your frame or saddle. This can help get weight off your body, eliminate the need for a saddle bag, and always ensure that you’ve got your repair kit ready and with you while you ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other Things to Carry</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We feel that a good multi-tool is an absolute necessity to bring with you on any type of bike ride whether that’s road, gravel, mountain, or even a daily commute. It’s not the only thing you should bring with you, of course, as a multi-tool can only do so much. What else you should bring with you depends on what type of riding you’re doing, how far you’re going, and may also be specific to the bike you’re riding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter the type of bike, we always recommend bringing a tube (that is the correct size for your tires) or possibly two if you’re prone to flatting, tire levers, and tubeless tire plugs (if you run tubeless). You’ll also want some way to inflate your tires like a mini pump or CO2 canisters and a CO2 inflator. A quick link (that is the right size and brand to match your chain) can speed up chain repair, and zip ties and/or some duct tape can often come in handy too. Of course, it’s always good to bring a first-aid kit for unexpected emergencies, possibly some toilet paper, some cash or a card, and, of course, snacks and water. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-value-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-value-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"A close-up look at the Pro Bike Tool 20-in-1 bike multi-tool and all its functions\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-value-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-value-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-value-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-value-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-value-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-value-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-value-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/multi-tool-value-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Pro Bike Tool 20-in-1 is super slim and lightweight, and it costs the least of any model we tested.

Still, these things cost money, but when you have the tools to make quick fixes and adjustments on a ride, it’s money well spent. The models we tested range in price from $29 for the <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/2227671/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPRO-BIKE-TOOL-20-in-1-Bike-Multitool-Compact-Lightweight-with-Slim-Bag%2F564027310&amp;subId1=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool\">Pro Bike Tool 20-in-1</a> up to a whopping $140 for the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgtoolsbikingmultitool&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F226064%2Fwolf-tooth-components-8-bit-kit-two-bike-multi-tool-set%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Wolf Tooth 8-Bit Kit Two</a> (which is essentially 3 separate tools in one). Special features, tools, and fancier designs certainly add to the price. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly all of the other tools we tested fall in the $40 to $60 range, with the Cannondale 18-in-1 with Dynaplug going for $80 (currently available for $60). How much you’re willing to spend depends on your budget, of course, but know that even the least expensive option is probably going to have you covered 99% of the time. It’s also important to note that multi-tools typically last for many years when treated with a reasonable amount of care, making even the more expensive options a good value over time. A great example is the Crankbrothers M-series tools that can last for decades.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Do I need a bike multi-tool?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Do you own a bike? Then yes, absolutely! We feel that a bike multi-tool is a must-have for any ride. Whether you need to make a comfort adjustment, tighten a loose bolt, adjust a derailleur, fix a broken chain, or any other variety of things, a good multi-tool should be able to get you back rolling instead of doing the walk of shame. If you don’t have a set of tools at home, a good multi-tool could also be super helpful for doing simple maintenance and repairs on your bike around the house. Either way, the answer is yes, we don’t ride without one and you shouldn’t either. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Which bike multi-tool should I buy?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Determining which tools are most important to have with you can help you narrow down the choices to find the right multi-tool. Assessing which hex, Torx, and screwdriver sizes your bike requires is a good first step, along with weighing the usefulness of other features like chain tools, tubeless repair, quick/master link storage, etc. It’s also important to consider how you intend to carry the tool as that may steer you in the direction of smaller and lighter options. The duration of your rides and/or the distance you’re traveling from civilization may also be a factor that sways you towards something more basic for shorter rides or something comprehensive to keep you rolling when you haven’t seen a person or had cell service for several hours. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>For rides, your home workshop, or both?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>In an ideal world, you’d have a multi-tool for mid-ride adjustments that lives in your saddle bag or riding kit year-round — one that you won’t take out to work on your bike in your home shop and then, inevitably, forget to put back in your saddlebag before your next ride. (We’ve all done it). You’d also have a selection of high-quality shop tools for every need in your bike workshop. But who lives in an ideal world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over many years of riding, however, we’ve found that it really does pay to have a separate multi-tool for each bike you own, kept in its own saddle bag or kit. This will save you time trying to find a multi-tool before a ride, and it will also allow you to match each multi-tool to the specific bike. On our road bikes, for instance, we keep a lightweight, compact tool with just the basics. For longer gravel and bikepacking rides, we pack a tool with a wider range of functions, along with tubeless tools and plugs, tire levers, and valve core tools and plugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also nice to keep a sturdy, multi-tool in your home shop. They’re great for when you want to make quick adjustments and don’t want to fish around in your shop toolbox. It’s also nice if the multi-tool in your shop includes a bottle opener.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>Do you absolutely need a chain tool?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>In our experience, broken chains don’t happen all that often, but you’re pretty much out of luck if it does break and you don’t have a tool to fix it (or know how to use that tool). It tends to happen more often in mountain and gravel biking when the chain is frequently under heavy loads and ridden in dirty conditions. But even then, if your chain is maintained, it’s possible to go a few years without breaking a link. Still, there’s pretty much no way to fix a broken chain without a chain tool, even if you’re carrying a quick link. That’s why all of the tools in this review have chain tools; because you’re much better off having one and not needing it than the other way around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, keep in mind that it takes some know-how and experience to fix a broken chain with a chain tool. It is much easier if you have a quick/master link, but even then it takes some know-how to do it right. We’ve seen a few riders on the side of the trail with a broken chain, holding a multi-tool with a chain breaker, and not knowing how to use it. (Be a good fellow cyclist and offer to help these folks.) It’s a skill that can be tricky to master, so it helps to practice on an old chain at home first. Note: If you plan to use a quick/master link, make sure it matches the number of speeds on your bike, usually 10, 11, or 12 speeds, which require links specific to each chain.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>What’s the difference between hex keys and Allen wrenches?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Nothing really at all. They are two names for the same thing. The term “Allen” comes from the Allen company that produced tools with hex-shaped heads and those tools became colloquially known as Allen wrenches. These days, the terms are used interchangeably to refer to the keys/wrenches with hexagonal heads and are measured in millimeter sizes. Bolts with hex heads are the most common on all types of bikes, so they are among the most important tools on a multi-tool. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>Fixed bits vs. separate bits?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Some tools include an array of separate bits that must be inserted into a handle to use. The advantage is that these generally make it easier to access tight spaces because the handles can be configured to hold the bits at different angles. The individual bits are also easily replaceable and can be found in most hardware stores, so you can carry spare bits or a wider selection of bits. The disadvantage is that the small bits are easy to drop and lose, especially in the dirt and poor lighting conditions – and black-colored ones seem to have a talent for disappearing in leafy duff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multi-tools with fixed bits hold all the tools together in one neat package, so selecting the right tool is like opening a blade on a Swiss Army Knife. They’re extremely easy to use, and they are much faster to work with in the middle of a ride than multi-tools with separate bits. The downside is that some models, especially those with short bits, can make it tougher to access tight spaces. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>Which is more important: size, weight, or price?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>In our opinion, size, though it depends on your specific needs. A compact multi-tool will leave more room in your saddle bag, fanny pack, or jersey pocket for other things, like a spare tube, tire levers, or an extra snack. The shape is also somewhat important because you want a tool that feels comfortable in your hand or a back pocket, is easy to grip, and provides good leverage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference between the heaviest and lightest multi-tools we reviewed is less than 80 grams (a little over 2 ounces). That’s not enough to sway our buying choice, though the very weight-conscious riders among us may prioritize low weight over all else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, price. Trust us on this: A good multi-tool will pay for itself the first time it saves you from being stranded, and is a wise investment that will last many years.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>How should I take care of a multi-tool?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Multi-tools are pretty simple things and they really don’t require much attention. Given that they are made from metal, however, it’s best to try and keep them relatively dry if possible to prevent the bits from corroding over time. Even tools that have corrosion-resistant coatings can start to corrode if they stay damp enough for long enough. If you know your tool has gotten wet, it is good practice to take it out of your saddle bag or pack to let it dry out, just don’t forget to put it back before your next ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, some folding multi-tools can get loose over time and the tools can fold out too easily, sometimes flopping around while you try to use them. This can usually be remedied by snugging up the bolt that holds the side plates together (the piece from which the tools pivot).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, taking a little care while using the tool can help to prevent stripping both the tool heads and the heads of bolts.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\n<div>\n\t<h2>Related Content</h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article>\n\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-bike-pump/\">\n\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bike-pumps-lead-image.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Pumps of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bike-pumps-lead-image.jpeg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bike-pumps-lead-image-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bike-pumps-lead-image-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bike-pumps-lead-image-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bike-pumps-lead-image-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bike-pumps-lead-image-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bike-pumps-lead-image-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bike-pumps-lead-image-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/buyers-guides/\">Buyers Guides</a></div>\n\n<h2>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-bike-pump/\">\n\t\tThe Best Bike Pumps of 2023\t</a>\n</h2>\n\n<div>\n\t<p>Whether you ride road, gravel, mountain, or electric bikes, a good floor pump is a must-have for every cyclist.
