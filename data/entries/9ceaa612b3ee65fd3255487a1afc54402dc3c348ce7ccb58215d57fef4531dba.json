The movie and TV show sections from the iTunes Store app on iPhones and iPads will also be eliminated.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple wants to push customers to the TV app, which already houses purchased movies and shows, ‌Apple TV+‌ content, and third-party channels that customers can subscribe to.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe TV app will serve as a hub for streaming content, and Gurman says the redesigned app will have a side panel at the left that can be used to navigate between different video categories.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUpdated navigation should make the TV app less confusing for consumers, making it clearer which content is from Apple and available through the ‌Apple TV+‌ subscription and which content requires a separate subscription.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-tv-app-revamp/\">Apple to Overhaul TV App, Remove Standalone Apps from Apple TV</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-overhaul-tv-app-remove-standalone-apps-from-apple-tv.2408557/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9ceaa612b3ee65fd3255487a1afc54402dc3c348ce7ccb58215d57fef4531dba","category":"Apple"}
