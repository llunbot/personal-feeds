Whereas many forms of MFA rely on one-time passcodes sent through SMS or emails or generated by authenticator apps, accounts enrolled in advanced protection require MFA based on cryptographic keys stored on a secure physical device. Unlike one-time passcodes, security keys stored on physical devices are immune to credential phishing and can’t be copied or sniffed.</p>\n<h2>Democratizing APP</h2>\n<p>APP, short for Advanced Account Protection, requires the key to be accompanied by a password whenever a user logs into an account on a new device. The protection prevents the types of account takeovers that allowed Kremlin-backed hackers to access the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/10/russia-linked-phishing-campaign-behind-the-dnc-breach-also-hit-podesta-powell/\">Gmail accounts of Democratic officials</a> in 2016 and go on to leak stolen emails to interfere with the presidential election that year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036985#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036985&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"77e71b19abcc5856fa2754c9cb8e71af15dd30335f6c09b93152cdf8dee6150d","category":"Tech"}
