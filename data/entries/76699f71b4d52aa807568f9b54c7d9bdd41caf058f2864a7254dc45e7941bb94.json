a five-stage race in Andaluc√≠a, southern Spain, the first two stages of the Vuelta a Andaluc√≠a were cancelled as a result of farmer protests in the region, which meant that police attention needed for the race was diverted,. The final two days of planned racing were also cancelled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just the individual time-trial remained, which was only 4.9km and covered a circuit around Alcaudete. It was won by Maxim van Gils (Lotto-Dstny) on his season debut, ahead of<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\"> UAE Team Emirates‚Äô</a> Juan Ayuso and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2023-pro-cycling-vuelta-femenina\" target=\"_blank\">Antonio Tiberi</a> of Bahrain Victorious.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tobias Halland Johannessen celebrates too early</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>This is why you should ùêçùêÑùêïùêÑùêë celebrate too early! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f633.png\" alt=\"üò≥\" /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClassicVar?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#ClassicVar</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/discoveryplusUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@discoveryplusUK</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/HUVi9BAgK9\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/HUVi9BAgK9</a></p>‚Äî Eurosport (@eurosport) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eurosport/status/1758507148475064718?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">February 16, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>The sight no one really wants to see. Tobias Halland Johannessen (Uno-X Mobility) thought he‚Äôd won Classic Var‚Ä¶ until Lenny Martinez (Groupama-FDJ) swooped past him in the final metres to snatch victory from under his nose. Johannessen thought the finish line was under the overhead gantry arch, but the white line marking the end of the race was just beyond it. The race ain‚Äôt over until it‚Äôs over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been plenty of riders throughout history who have shared the same unfortunate fate, including that infamous 2020 Li√®ge-Bastogne-Li√®ge in which Primo≈æ Rogliƒç snatched victory from a celebrating Julian Alaphilippe (who also got relegated so he wasn‚Äôt even second).
