The huge sums invested in research and development to make a Formula One and Formula E car a split second faster than a rival team’s has seen the likes of carbon fibre, battery efficiency and aerodynamics filter their way down into everyday use.</span></p>\n<p>It’s not just in car manufacturing either. In fact, cycling has been one of its biggest beneficiaries. You only have to compare <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/4343/best-road-bike\" target=\"_blank\">road bikes</a> over the last 30 years to see how much of an influence the sleek, smooth lines of a carbon fibre racing car have had. And that’s before you get to the marginal gains and watt-saving improvements in everythingfrom components to clothing.</p>\n<p><span>To look at most e-bikes though, you wouldn’t know it. Bulky, unsightly and with battery packs that stick out like sore thumbs, their design hasn’t caught up with sleek, modern standards. Until now.</span></p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/2021/12/nplus_mercedes_ebike_02.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p><span>The new n+ range has the looks of a normal bike but with the hidden power of an e-bike. Made in collaboration with the Mercedes-Benz EQ Formula E Team, the e-bikes bring a slice of high performance engineering to the world of battery-powered cycling.</span></p>\n<p><span>The most visible (or, rather, invisible) difference is how its electric power assistance components are all concealed within the frame. The outcome is a streamlined ride that can really fly. It’s not just the look that is seamless, though. Here are just some of the other ways that the n+ Mercedes-EQ range has pushed the boundaries of e-bikes.</span></p>\n<h2>No gears? No problem</h2>\n<p>Comparing bikes used to be like Top Trumps; more gears would generally equal a better bike. That has started to shift in recent years, as the increase in cassette size and the subsequent broadening of available gear ratios has seen a rise in 1× (AKA single chainring) machines that were previously the preserve of mountain biking.</p>\n<p>The n+ Mercedes-EQ range takes this a step further. Although on the surface the e-bikes might look like they are singlespeed, the inner workings actually bring automatic transmission to the world of cycling. Each bike benefits from an Enviolo Constant Variable Transmission rear hub, which seamlessly changes the gear ratio to match your pedaling cadence and efforts.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/2021/12/nplus_mercedes_ebike_03.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Not only that, but the hub is maintenance- and noise-free. The result is an e-bike that is as easy to ride on flats as it is hills, while clunky gear changes are consigned to the history books.</p>\n<h2><span>Maximising performance through mid-drive power</span></h2>\n<p><span>Many e-bikes are either front or rear wheel drive. A cheap and simple way of electrifying a bike, this elemental approach does have some downsides – namely in performance – as the concentration of weight at either end leads to an unbalanced ride that can hamper handling.</span></p>\n<p><span>To solve this, n+ has tapped into the same layout as the Mercedes-Benz EQ Formula E Team race car, centering the power unit in the middle of the bike to deliver 50/50 weight distribution. In practice, the e-bikes ride like non-electrified ones, allowing you to enjoy your experience without any limitations.</span></p>\n<h2><span>An ultra-efficient chain reaction</span></h2>\n<p><span>The final key feature on the n+ Mercedes-EQ range is the use of a Gates Carbon Belt Drive instead of a bog-standard chain. The technology has the same function as a metal-link version – it transfers power from the pedals to the rear wheel – but has added efficiencies that will keep you, and your bike, going for longer.</span></p>\n<p><span>Maintaining the belt drive is as simple as hosing it down – there’s no need to grease or degrease, and you will never again be plagued by rust. What’s more, the no-stretch carbon cord technology means that the belt will last up to 20,000 miles, roughly 7-10-times longer than a standard bike chain.</span></p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/2021/12/nplus_mercedes_ebike_04.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<h2>Exploring the n+ Mercedes-EQ range</h2>\n<p>All of the above are just some of the ways that Mercedes’ class-leading F1 and Formula E cars have fed into the n+ range. But each e-bike has its unique characteristics that make it a great purchase – from the entry-level City Racer to the pioneering Silver Arrows model.</p>\n<p><strong>n+ Mercedes-Benz EQ Formula E Team City Racer e-bike<br />\n</strong><strong>Price:</strong> £1,720<br />\nA classic step-through e-bike, the City Racer is ideal for commuting and is easy to mount and dismount. Although it’s the cheapest model in the range, it benefits from the carbon belt drive detailed above. Plus, it comes in a striking colourway that highlights its Mercedes-EQ pedigree, albeit without the price tag.</p>\n<p><strong>n+ Mercedes-Benz EQ Formula E Team e-bike<br />\n</strong><strong>Price:</strong> £2,820<br />\nIn the middle of the range is the Formula E Team e-bike. Packing 65Nm of torque, you’ll never be left wanting when pulling away at traffic lights or embarking on a hill climb. Weighing in at 18kg on the scales, it’s one of the lighter road-focused e-bikes around, and leaves you with a great power-to-weight ratio and the handling of a non-electric bike.</p>\n<p><strong>n+ Mercedes-Benz EQ Formula E Team Silver Arrows e-bike<br />\n</strong><strong>Price:</strong> £3,960<br />\nWhen it comes to industry-leading e-bikes, nothing compares to the Silver Arrows. Constructed around a beautifully hand polished, brushed aluminium finish, you’re sure to turn heads for all the right reasons. As well as having the best specifications of the n+ range, it also comes with dual batteries, giving you a whopping 60-mile range between charges.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that the range is available exclusively at <a href=\"https://www.nplusbikes.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">n+ bikes</a>, while stock is limited. So, if you plan on complimenting your new Mercedes EQ electric vehicle and creating the ultimate Mercedes garage or simply want an industry-leading e-bike, you’ll have to be quick off the line.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Secure your e-bike allocation online at <a href=\"https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5850572568&amp;iu=/359/impcount.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">nplusbikes.co.uk</a></strong></em> </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/bikes\">Bikes</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"SimonR","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"82bcc8fec23a8990c274cae83a933b23b54f4fb6429885c32c5a11cc4419fc19","category":"Cycling"}
