This 2,057m colossus is darker, moodier and more mysterious than its neighbours. While many climbs nearby serve up pleasant, forested landscapes and elegant mountain tapestries, the Fedaia oozes a wild and savage hostility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some visitors dismiss the pass as ugly, but that’s untrue. The Fedaia is atmospheric and boasts the kind of raw, rugged aesthetics appreciated by mountaineers. The towers of rock that surround its steep hairpins are grand and imposing, and the barren, brooding landscapes trigger chills of unease. The Fedaia boasts all the irresistible gloom and glamour of a Gothic horror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This formidable pass borders the Italian regions of Trentino and Belluno, just a 40km ride south of the tourism hub of Corvara in Alta Badia. Hidden among a tumble of twisted turrets in the Dolomites, it sits beneath the Marmolada – the ‘Queen of the Dolomites’ – which at 3,343m is the highest peak in the area. This looming leviathan only enhances the oppressive atmosphere of the Fedaia.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/passo-gardena-cycling\">Classic climb: Passo Gardena, a breathtaking climb in the Italian Dolomites</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/classic-climbs-passo-falzarego-valparola\">Classic climbs: Passo Falzarego &amp;

It has soul-draining hairpins at 16-18% and the final 5km barely drops below 12%. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That may explain why the pass doesn’t feature in the Sella Ronda or Maratona dles Dolomites sportives, but it has often tormented pro riders at the Giro d’Italia. The 2001 and 2003 Giro champion Gilberto Simoni crowned it the ‘hardest climb in Italy’. Others have called it ‘the graveyard of champions’.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-03-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Passo Fedaia Classic Climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-03-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-03.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Into the graveyard</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fedaia was introduced by former race director Vincenzo Torriani, who also brought the fearsome Stelvio to the Giro in 1953. Its first planned appearance, in 1969, was portentous, as snow on the pass and bruising hail in the valley led to the cancellation of the stage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The peloton returned a year later, on Stage 18 of the 1970 race, when Italian Michele Dancelli escaped a group containing Eddy Merckx before winning a six-man battle to the finish line.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-04-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Passo Fedaia Classic Climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-04-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-04-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-04-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-04-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-04-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-04.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>On Stage 20 of the 1975 race, GC leader Fausto Bertoglio cracked on the Fedaia but managed to cling on to the pink jersey despite Roger De Vlaeminck claiming the stage win. In 1996 Russian Pavel Tonkov blew up on the Fedaia on Stage 20, finishing over a minute behind stage winner Enrico Zaina. The Fedaia cost Tonkov the pink jersey but he regained it on the penultimate stage to win the race.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Passo Fedaia Classic Climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-05.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most famous day on the Fedaia belongs to Italian icon Marco Pantani. On the 215km Stage 17 of the 1998 Giro, Tonkov goaded Pantani with an acceleration on the Fedaia – but never pull a gun unless you’re prepared to shoot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pantani, racing on the climb for the first time, delivered a lethal counterattack. Having wreaked mayhem, Pantani finished with the same time as stage winner Giuseppe Guerini, over two minutes ahead of Tonkov and four minutes ahead of race leader Alex Zülle of Switzerland. Pantani’s fireworks on the Fedaia decided the race: he took the pink jersey and kept it until the finish.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Passo Fedaia Classic Climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-06-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-06-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-06.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The Baita Dovich bar is a tempting place to stop as you enter the final 5km – although the danger is you might never get going again.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Road to hell</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The eastern gateway to the Fedaia is the town of Caprile, which sits in a sun-drenched valley surrounded by forests and snow-capped peaks. It is so tranquil it’s hard to imagine the suffering that awaits beyond the horizon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pass can also be tackled from Canazei in the west, but that 13.9km ascent, which has 617m of climbing at an average gradient of just 4.4%, offers a much less dramatic journey. On the Caprile route you must complete a full kilometre (993m) of vertical ascent, including that vicious final 5km at 12% and those stabs at 18%.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-07-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Passo Fedaia Classic Climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-07-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-07-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-07-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-07-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-07-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-07-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-07-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-07.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The 13km ascent takes in 1,059m of vertical gain at an average gradient of 7.5%, but many of the hairpins nudge 18%.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Passing the wooden ‘Arrivederci’ sign on the outskirts of Caprile, you pedal west over a flower-lined bridge and head to the commune of Saviner di Laste. The blue ‘Fedaia’ sign on its outskirts marks the official start of the climb.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The road soon kicks up with double-digit gradients as you pass huge metal avalanche fences. A pair of broad hairpins leads into a forested valley where the gradient momentarily calms. Then you carve through a gap in the mountains and glimpse for the first time the high-altitude terrain ahead.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-08-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Passo Fedaia Classic Climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-08-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-08-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-08-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-08-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-08-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-08-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-08.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Waterfalls abound in the majestic Sottoguda gorge, which reopened in July 2024 after storm damage had closed the road for nearly six years.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>From Sottoguda, where you can top up your water bottle in the village fountain, you pass the majestic beauty of the Sottoguda gorge. Carved by the Pettorina river, this gorge boasts steep rock walls and tumbling waterfalls. You can follow the main road or divert to the traffic-free Serrai di Sottoguda track, which cuts directly through the gorge. On the climb’s first appearance at the Giro in 1970, the pro riders took this scenic detour. It was closed after a storm damaged the track in October 2018 but it reopened again in July 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just before you arrive in Malga Ciapela, after emerging from a dripping tunnel, the colossal slab of the Marmolada looms into view. It’s a sign that you are about to enter the section known as the ‘graveyard of champions’.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-09-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Passo Fedaia Classic Climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-09-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-09-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-09-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-09-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-09-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-09-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-09-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-09.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>First comes a straight, soul-crushing 3km stretch averaging 12%, with jolts at 16%. Then there’s a brutal 2km tangle of hairpins with relentless gradients that surge up to 18%. These are the slopes that have earned the Fedaia its notorious reputation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 2.4km from the summit you pass a bar-refuge called Capanna Bill, which offers a welcome time-out for anyone feeling thirsty. But there is no easy finish. The gradients soar again and the hairpins continue to swirl. ‘Climbing by foot, even your shins hurt,’ complained former Giro race director Angelo Zomegnan.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-10-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Passo Fedaia Classic Climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-10-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-10-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-10-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-10-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-10-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-10-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/passo-fedaia-classic-climb-10.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The gradient in the final 5km barely drops below 12%, which helps to explain why the climb doesn’t feature in some of the region’s toughest sportives but has tormented the pros for decades.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Maybe it is those vindictive gradients, or the looming peaks around the pass, but the atmosphere at the summit feels dark and threatening. The mountain has a bloody history too: the Fedaia witnessed fierce battles during the First World War and the landscape is pitted with tunnels once used for storing gun powder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re unlikely to have much firepower left in your legs when you crest the high-altitude summit, but you are rewarded with an incredible view of the legendary road you have just climbed, which spirals deep down into the valley. The hulking mass of the Marmolada dominates the skyline and the Lago della Fedaia glistens to the north.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a uniquely eerie mountain summit. You’ll feel a strange chill down your spine – but it’s nothing to do with the altitude or the temperature.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/passo-gardena-cycling\">Classic climb: Passo Gardena, a breathtaking climb in the Italian Dolomites</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/classic-climbs-passo-falzarego-valparola\">Classic climbs: Passo Falzarego &amp; Passo Valparola, a Dolomites duo with a rich history</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/passo-sella-cycling\">Classic climb: Passo Sella, a fabled rock of the Giro d’Italia</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/passo-giau-cycling\">Classic climb: Passo Giau, a stunning climb in the Dolomites with an unrelenting gradient</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tre-cime-di-lavaredo-cycling\">Classic climb: Tre Cime di Lavaredo, a fearsome climb in the Dolomites that’s about more than just numbers</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/passo-fedaia-cycling\">Classic climb: Passo Fedaia, the Gothic Italian monster dubbed ‘the graveyard of champions’</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"48fc927ebdff09d1a2cc677adc86f2319c86bf0d332e77a3b242c31e9632fd02","category":"Cycling"}
