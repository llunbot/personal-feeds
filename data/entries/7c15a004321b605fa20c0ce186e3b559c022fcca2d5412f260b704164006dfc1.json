There aren’t many concrete details on the new prototype mountain bike besides the name and its implications, just yet.

But Atherton has revealed that it’s still an A.200. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means 200mm of rear wheel travel. And it is an A Range bike – their “pinnacle of engineering excellence” – featuring carbon tubes bonded to their 3D-printed titanium lugs. That also means 22 standard frame sizes will be offered, plus the option for full custom geometry, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bike-A-200-G-DH-prototype-3D-printed-titanium-and-carbon-gearbox-downhill-mountain-bike_same-Dave-Weagle-DW6-suspension-design-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bike-A-200-G-DH-prototype-3D-printed-titanium-and-carbon-gearbox-downhill-mountain-bike_same-Dave-Weagle-DW6-suspension-design-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Atherton Bikes A.200.G 3D-printed gearbox DH bike prototype, still DW6\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bike-A-200-G-DH-prototype-3D-printed-titanium-and-carbon-gearbox-downhill-mountain-bike_same-Dave-Weagle-DW6-suspension-design-jpg.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bike-A-200-G-DH-prototype-3D-printed-titanium-and-carbon-gearbox-downhill-mountain-bike_same-Dave-Weagle-DW6-suspension-design-297x238.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bike-A-200-G-DH-prototype-3D-printed-titanium-and-carbon-gearbox-downhill-mountain-bike_same-Dave-Weagle-DW6-suspension-design-120x96.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bike-A-200-G-DH-prototype-3D-printed-titanium-and-carbon-gearbox-downhill-mountain-bike_same-Dave-Weagle-DW6-suspension-design-768x614.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A Range also means the more complex 6-bar DW6 linkage designed by Dave Weagle.

The chainstay yoke exhibits revised shaping to clear the new gearbox yoke and the bike’s lower short link. But it still has the same 2-pivot layout for the DW6 suspension design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the big change is the gearbox yoke/mount/lug, or whatever we want to call the replacement for the bottom bracket lug. That’s the tallest piece in the 3D-print, and the  blurry element the Atherton engineers are holding in the lede image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s quite a complex part to hand the gearbox under the frame by six bolts, while being bonded with double-lap shear joints onto the carbon downtube &amp; seattube, and providing the three of the lower pivot points in the DW6 suspension layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is it a Pinion SmartShift Ci-Line gearbox, with a Gates belt-drive?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bike-A-200-G-DH-prototype-3D-printed-titanium-and-carbon-gearbox-downhill-mountain-bike_gearbox-mock-up-with-name-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bike-A-200-G-DH-prototype-3D-printed-titanium-and-carbon-gearbox-downhill-mountain-bike_gearbox-mock-up-with-name-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Atherton Bikes A.200.G 3D-printed gearbox DH bike prototype, it has a name\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bike-A-200-G-DH-prototype-3D-printed-titanium-and-carbon-gearbox-downhill-mountain-bike_gearbox-mock-up-with-name-jpg.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bike-A-200-G-DH-prototype-3D-printed-titanium-and-carbon-gearbox-downhill-mountain-bike_gearbox-mock-up-with-name-297x238.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bike-A-200-G-DH-prototype-3D-printed-titanium-and-carbon-gearbox-downhill-mountain-bike_gearbox-mock-up-with-name-120x96.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bike-A-200-G-DH-prototype-3D-printed-titanium-and-carbon-gearbox-downhill-mountain-bike_gearbox-mock-up-with-name-768x614.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We aren’t 100% sure, but it looks like this Atherton A.200.G is designed to work with Pinion’s category-leading C-line gearbox. This gearbox dummy confirms the prototype bike’s name, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And interestingly, the glimpses of the gearbox itself both feature a Gates centerline-style belt cog. Presumably then, this Atherton DH prototype will feature a belt tensioner, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s the same, now electronic-shifting gearbox we’ve seen in <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/intense-m1-pinion-prototype-teases-gearbox-dh-bike-future-of-electronic-auto-shifts/\" target=\"_blank\">Intense’s M1 Pinion prototype</a> DH bike last year, as well as the Gamux Sego that we’ve already spotted trying to nab Gate’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/think-you-can-win-a-dh-world-cup-gatesll-give-you-e100k-if-you-do-it-with-a-belt-drive/\" target=\"_blank\">as-yet-unclaimed €100K prize</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The reasoning for a gearbox DH bike remains the same for Atherton as it has for Gamux &amp; Intense, and even something as disparate as the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/surly-moonlander-takes-off-with-24-x-6-2-tires-and-pinion-gearbox/\" target=\"_blank\">Surly Moonlander</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No derailleur getting bashed off a passing rock, perfect shifts in the harshest riding conditions, and lower maintenance. Better weight distribution – lower &amp; more central center of gravity. And ultimately more ability to tune suspension around a bike’s sprung weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When is it coming?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bikes_2024-Customer-Day-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1201\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bikes_2024-Customer-Day-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Atherton Bikes 2024 customer appreciation day\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bikes_2024-Customer-Day-jpg.webp 1201w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bikes_2024-Customer-Day-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bikes_2024-Customer-Day-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bikes_2024-Customer-Day-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On social media, Atherton Bikes is still only teasing individual elements of their A.200.G DH prototype, no complete bike pics. And just an hourglass emoji to tease us that it’s coming soon. So we expect it’ll be quite a while until this thing makes it into production. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with the 2025 UCI Mountain Bike World Series set to kick off with a World Cup return to Bielsko-Biała, Poland in mid-May, we’ll be in the ground trying to get some closer spy shots from the race track!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can’t forget Ridgeline VI: Kazakhstan</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We can’t not mention Gee’s latest Ridgeline video, even if he’s riding the standard A.200, not the prototype gearbox bike…</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Ridgeline, the renowned mountain bike film series known for capturing some of the most awe-inspiring and high-stakes mountain bike adventures across the globe, launches its latest and most ambitious instalment: Ridgeline VI: Kazakhstan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In pursuit of a fresh challenge, the Ridgeline team turned their sights beyond the familiar mountains of Europe. Seeking a place of mystery and raw, untouched beauty, they found themselves drawn to Kazakhstan. Covering an immense 2.7 million square kilometres, Kazakhstan is the world’s ninth-largest country, a land that demands a new level of preparation and respect. Unlike previous projects where the team could adapt quickly, Kazakhstan’s vast and remote stretches required far greater planning. With long distances between petrol stations and rugged, isolated terrain, every step of the journey had to be carefully thought out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gee’s journey in Kazakhstan saw him tackling huge, natural lines onboard his Atherton Bikes A.200, calling on every inch of travel to soften the rugged desert terrain. Hitting massive, loose scree slopes, often blindly, with just one take to nail it, the experience has redefined the team’s understanding of big mountain riding potential, highlighting the delicate balance between ambition and the unforgiving reality of these untouched environments.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.athertonbikes.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>AthertonBikes.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/atherton-bike-a200g-prototype-3d-printed-gearbox-dh-mountain-bike/\">Atherton Tease A.200.G, a Prototype 3D-Printed Titanium &amp; Carbon Gearbox DH Bike</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"7c15a004321b605fa20c0ce186e3b559c022fcca2d5412f260b704164006dfc1","category":"Cycling"}
