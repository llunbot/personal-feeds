You can remove the operational burden of patching, upgrades, and maintenance downtime and count on an easy-to-use developer experience to create a new database in a few quick steps.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/13/2025-aurora-dsql-1-werner-keynote-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1483\" height=\"859\" />When we introduced the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/introducing-amazon-aurora-dsql/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&amp;sc_channel=el\">preview of Aurora DSQL</a> at AWS re:Invent 2024, our customers were excited by this innovative solution to simplify complex relational database challenges. In his keynote, Dr. Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon.com, talked about managing complexity upfront in the design of Aurora DSQL. Unlike most traditional databases, Aurora DSQL is disaggregated into multiple independent components such as a query processor, adjudicator, journal, and crossbar.</p> \n<p>These components have high cohesion, communicate through well-specified APIs, and scale independently based on your workloads. This architecture enables multi-Region strong consistency with low latency and globally synchronized time. To learn more about how Aurora DSQL works behind the scenes, watch <a href=\"https://youtu.be/aim5x73crbM?si=Ur3aLJQdxnsL6RmC&amp;t=5162\">Dr. Werner Vogels’ keynote </a>and read about <a href=\"https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2025/05/just-make-it-scale-an-aurora-dsql-story.html\">an Aurora DSQL story</a>.</p> \n<p><strong><u>The architecture of Amazon Aurora DSQL</u></strong><br /> Your application can use the fastest distributed SQL reads and writes and scale to meet any workload demand without any database sharding or instance upgrades. With Aurora DSQL, its active-active distributed architecture is designed for 99.99 percent availability in a single Region and 99.999 percent availability across multiple Regions. This means your applications can continue to read and write with strong consistency, even in the rare case an application is unable to connect to a Region cluster endpoint.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/13/2025-aurora-dsql-2-architecture.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2066\" height=\"1030\" /></p> \n<p>In a single-Region configuration, Aurora DSQL commits all write transactions to a distributed transaction log and synchronously replicates all committed log data to user storage replicas in three Availability Zones. Cluster storage replicas are distributed across a storage fleet and automatically scale to ensure optimal read performance.</p> \n<p>Multi-Region clusters provide the same resilience and connectivity as single-Region clusters while improving availability through two Regional endpoints, one for each peered cluster Region. Both endpoints of a peered cluster present a single logical database and support concurrent read and write operations with strong data consistency. A third Region acts as a log-only witness which means there is is no cluster resource or endpoint. This means you can balance applications and connections for geographic locations, performance, or resiliency purposes, making sure readers consistently see the same data.</p> \n<p>Aurora DSQL is an ideal choice to support applications using microservices and event-driven architectures, and you can design highly scalable solutions for industries such as banking, ecommerce, travel, and retail. It’s also ideal for multi-tenant software as a service (SaaS) applications and data-driven services like payment processing, gaming platforms, and social media applications that require multi-Region scalability and resilience.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Getting started with Amazon Aurora DSQL</u></strong><br /> Aurora DSQL provides a easy-to-use experience, starting with a simple console experience. You can use familiar SQL clients to leverage existing skillsets, and integration with other AWS services to improve managing databases.</p> \n<p>To create an Aurora DSQL cluster, go to the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/dsql/clusters/home?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&amp;sc_channel=el\">Aurora DSQL console</a> and choose <strong>Create cluster</strong>. You can choose either <strong>Single-Region</strong> or <strong>Multi-Region</strong> configuration options to help you establish the right database infrastructure for your needs.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/16/2025-aurora-dsql-3-1-create-single-cluster.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1992\" height=\"734\" /></p> \n<p><strong>1. Create a single-Region cluster</strong></p> \n<p>To create a single-Region cluster, you only choose <strong>Create cluster</strong>. That’s all.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/16/2025-aurora-dsql-3-1-create-single-cluster.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2072\" height=\"1204\" /></p> \n<p>In a few minutes, you’ll see your Aurora DSQL cluster created. To connect your cluster, you can use your favorite SQL client such as <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#accessing-sql-clients-psql\">PostgreSQL interactive terminal</a>,  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#accessing-sql-clients-dbeaver\">DBeaver</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#accessing-sql-clients-datagrip\">JetBrains DataGrip</a>, or you can take <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/programming-with.html?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&amp;sc_channel=el\">various programmable approaches</a> with a database endpoint and authentication token as a password.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/16/2025-aurora-dsql-3-1-list-single-cluster.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2336\" height=\"1041\" /></p> \n<p>To get the authentication token, choose <strong>Connect</strong> and <strong>Get Token</strong> in your cluster detail page. Copy the endpoint from <strong>Endpoint (Host)</strong> and the generated authentication token after <strong>Connect as admin</strong> is chosen in the <strong>Authentication token (Password)</strong> section.</p> \n<p>Then, choose <strong>Open in CloudShell</strong>, and with a few clicks, you can seamlessly connect to your cluster.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/16/2025-aurora-dsql-4-connect-cluster.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2328\" height=\"1216\" /></p> \n<p>After you connect the Aurora DSQL cluster, test your cluster by running <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/aurora-dsql-samples/tree/main/quickstart_data\">sample SQL statements</a>. You can also query SQL statements for your applications using <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/aws-sdks.html?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&amp;sc_channel=el\">your favorite programming languages</a>: Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, Ruby, .NET, Rust, and Golang. You can build sample applications using a Django, Ruby on Rails, and AWS Lambda application to interact with Amazon Aurora DSQL.</p> \n<p><strong>2.
