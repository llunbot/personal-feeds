But with the Pactimo shorts, I noticed them by their absence.</p>\n<p>Raw-edged front straps aren’t that uncommon in flashier bibshorts, but in the Summit Classics they extend all the way down the sides of the rear yoke and around the top edge of the shorts’ bottoms too. There is a seam there, but it’s further down the body, where the top and bottom halves meet.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9953/pactimo-summit-classic-bibshorts-photos#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 5</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/pactimo_summit_classic_shorts_1.jpg?itok=_7RQBcfw\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 1 of </span>5</p>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>At the back, the straps are flatlock-sewn into the central part of the yoke, which is made of a hexagonal pattern mesh which lets plenty of air through.</p>\n<p>The leg ends are also raw-edged, with the main leg fabric extending down without seams or separate grippers. They’re printed inside with around 5cm of silicone dot grippers which keep them firmly in place mid-thigh.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pactimo.com/collections/mens-bike-bibs-shorts/products/mens-summit-classic-cycling-bibs\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Pactimo Summit Classic bibshorts now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>There are a couple of seams running the length of the inside of the legs and a few more in the body. They’re raised, but none of them are in places where they’re noticeable.</p>\n<p>It all adds up to a comfortable fit, which is well-cut to be close but not quite as compressive as some competitors. The fabric used in the Summit Classic bibshorts is silky smooth too, with a quality feel. There’s little adornment, with just a couple of reflective Pactimo logos at the hips and small retro tabs printed onto the bottom of the legs, so the Summit Classics have an understated look that will go with anything.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9953/pactimo-summit-classic-bibshorts-photos#3\"><p><span>Image 4 of</span> 5</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/pactimo_summit_classic_shorts_4.jpg?itok=171oJvAb\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 4 of </span>5</p>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>Turning to the seat pad, this is a multi-layer design from pad supremos Elastic Interface. It’s made from a mix of foam densities up to a very high 120kg/m3 under the sitbones. Despite this, the pad doesn’t feel as firm as some, possibly because the high density areas aren’t quite as thick and it’s well perforated for ventilation.</p>\n<p>But nevertheless it’s plenty comfortable for hot, bumpy gravel bike rides. Pactimo describes it as a 12-hour pad, which seems plausible, although I didn’t attempt any rides that long. More bulk may protect you from the saddle better, but can start to feel uncomfortably sweaty after a long period in the heat.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/2104/vuelta-a-espana-route-race-reports-tv-guide-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Vuelta a Espana 2021: Route, start list, live TV guide and all we know so far</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/913/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2021: Route, teams and all you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/8891/vuelta-a-espana-classic-climb-alto-de-velefique\">Vuelta a Espana Classic Climb: Alto de Velefique</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nSeveral of my rides in the Summit Classic bibshorts were on particularly hot, sunny days, but they coped well with sweat and never felt clammy. The feature rich design and quality detailing make the Pactimo bibshorts pretty fit-and-forget and once I was out riding, they weren’t something I noticed particularly.</p>\n<p>That’s how you’d want bibshorts to function – they were just comfortable mile after mile and the durable build suggests that they should stay the course over many rides.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pactimo.com/collections/mens-bike-bibs-shorts/products/mens-summit-classic-cycling-bibs\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Pactimo Summit Classic bibshorts now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>The £160 pricetag puts the Summit Classics in the middle of Pactimo’s range and seems pretty reasonable in comparison with other brands’ offerings for the high spec and quality. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/reviews/9953/pactimo-summit-classic-bibshorts-photos\">Pactimo Summit Classic bibshorts photos</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/reviews\">Reviews</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>2 Aug 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9953%2Fpactimo-summit-classic-bibshorts-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Pactimo%20Summit%20Classic%20bibshorts%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9953%2Fpactimo-summit-classic-bibshorts-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Pactimo%20Summit%20Classic%20bibshorts%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9953%2Fpactimo-summit-classic-bibshorts-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Pactimo%20Summit%20Classic%20bibshorts%20photos&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9953%2Fpactimo-summit-classic-bibshorts-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9953/pactimo-summit-classic-bibshorts-photos#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 5</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/pactimo_summit_classic_shorts_1.jpg?itok=_7RQBcfw\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/bibshorts\">Bibshorts</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"bba1308870dade65c1f8acd8feb5f3fc37629c3f04260dee657da99188b2986e","category":"Cycling"}
