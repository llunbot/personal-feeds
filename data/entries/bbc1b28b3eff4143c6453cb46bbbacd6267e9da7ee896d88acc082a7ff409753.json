They can also participate in automations and scenes, and respond to Siri requests. So you can add them to your cleaning routines â€” or tell Siri to do some spot cleaning in the living room.</blockquote>Likewise, the iOS 18.3 beta will add robot vacuum support to the Home app on the iPhone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Code Changes</h2>\r<br />\n<h3>Additional Screen Savers Removed</h3>\r<br />\nThe recently-released <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-releases-tvos-18-2/\">tvOS 18.2 update</a> for the Apple TV added a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/tvos-18-2-snoopy-screen-savers/\">rotating Snoopy screen saver</a> to 2021 and newer models, but it appears that other new screen savers that Apple planned for the device have either been canceled or postponed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Apple-TV-Plus-Foundation.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1120\" height=\"630\" />\r<br />\nApple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/new-apple-tv-screen-savers-coming-soon/\">planning at least two additional screen saver categories</a> for the Apple TV. The first was a \"TV and Movies\" category of screen savers based on content from Apple TV+ series and movies, and the second was a \"Soundscapes\" category of screen savers overlaid with relaxing background sounds, including water and nature sounds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/\">Aaron Perris</a> has confirmed that hidden references to the \"TV and Movies\" and \"Soundscapes\" screen saver categories that were in tvOS 18.2 code are no longer present in the first tvOS 18.3 beta's code.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast month, it was reported that Apple removed all references to the \"TV and Movies\" screen savers <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/28/no-movie-screen-savers-for-apple-tv/\">from its Apple TV page</a>, including a preview of a new screen saver based on the Apple TV+ series \"Foundation.\" With references to the screen savers removed in the tvOS 18.3 beta, there is now even more evidence they are canceled or postponed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to Snoopy, existing screen saver categories on the Apple TV include Aerials, Memories, and a Portraits option with an on-screen clock.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Digital Sales Notice</h3>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe following digital sales notice will be visible in the Apple TV app, according to tvOS 18.3 code:<blockquote>When you purchase access to this item, you can permanently download it to your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or PC.
