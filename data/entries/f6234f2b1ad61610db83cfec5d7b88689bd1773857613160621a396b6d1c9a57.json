Next year, the Vision Pro will arrive, Apple will reportedly unleash new operating systems powered by next-generation AI, and the entire iPad product line will probably get updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every year in this space, I try to predict what will happen during the next year. And just to be fair, every year in this space, I <em>also</em> grade my past predictions. (Be honest: how many pundits call attention to their prior year’s punditry?)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year I “predicted” the future in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1439158/2023-predictions-macbook-air-mac-pro-imac-ipad.html\">not one</a> but <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1427451/2022-apple-silicon-transition-mac-pro-vr-headset-stage-manager.html\">two</a> different articles. I’m going to say that I got more right than I got wrong, but I had hoped that 2023 would be a bit more earth-shaking than it turned out to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Mac surprised</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading the tea leaves (and various news reports), I correctly anticipated that new MacBook Pros would arrive bearing new Apple silicon processors. The question is, should I get double points for this prediction? The answer is no because I don’t think anyone predicted that Apple would update the MacBook Pro twice in a single calendar year. But that’s what happened, thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2120691/m3-m3-pro-and-m3-max-specs-features-cpu-gpu.html\">early arrival of the M3 chip</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/macbook-pro-back-colors.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"The 2023 MacBook Pro in Silver (middle), Space Black (center), and Space Gray (right)\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/macbook-pro-back-colors.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/macbook-pro-back-colors.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/macbook-pro-back-colors.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/macbook-pro-back-colors.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/macbook-pro-back-colors.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/macbook-pro-back-colors.jpg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/macbook-pro-back-colors.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/macbook-pro-back-colors.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><figcaption><p>Apple issued not one but two MacBook Pro updates in 2023.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A year ago, Apple still had an Intel-based Mac mini on its price list because it had only replaced the low-end model with a low-end M1 chip. I correctly predicted that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347466/mac-mini-design-processsor-price-release.html\">M2 Mac mini</a> would rectify matters by shipping with both an M2 chip and an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1480091/mac-mini-m2-pro-review.html\">M2 Pro chip</a>, blowing Intel off the price list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other Intel Mac that was still kicking around was the Mac Pro, and I predicted that it would also be replaced by an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347010/new-mac-pro-2023.html\">Apple silicon model,</a> thereby closing the books on the Apple silicon transition. Yep, that happened–and better yet, I described the Mac Pro as being more like “a really, really big Mac Studio,” which is <em>exactly</em> what it turned out to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, all this talk of a new Mac Pro made me positively giddy. One of the first rules of predictions is never, <em>ever</em> predict a new Apple display. Apple displays are never late–like wizards, they always arrive precisely when they intend to. I’m pretty sure Apple is working on a new, cutting-edge external display with extended dynamic range, but it certainly did not happen in 2023, much to my chagrin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other Mac news, I correctly guessed that the newest Mac model would be a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1948603/15-inch-macbook-air-m2-review.html\">15-inch variation on the MacBook Air</a> and that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2126614/24-inch-imac-m3-review.html\">iMac would get an update</a>. Sadly, I missed my guess that the new iMac would have new colors, and I utterly failed in my prediction that there would be a larger “iMac Pro” model. Instead, we got an Apple statement declaring that there was <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2126605/apple-confirms-that-a-27-inch-imac-isnt-in-its-plans.html\">no 27-inch iMac in development</a>! Ouch.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Feel the excitement</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a big year for the iPhone, with the new iPhone 15 models <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2084068/what-can-iphone-15-usb-c-port-do.html\">featuring USB-C</a> (as I predicted), the Dynamic Island coming to non-Pro models (also my prediction), and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2081235/iphone-15-pro-max-review.html\">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> having a new camera “the likes of which we haven’t seen before” (my prediction). My only real prediction failure: I thought that the largest iPhone would also look a little different, with some “new design flourishes.” I know a lot of people were hoping for an iPhone Ultra, but that’s not quite what we got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was <em>not</em> a big year for the iPad, and that’s an understatement. Literally, the biggest new hardware announcement for the entire iPad line was Apple’s release of a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2108888/apple-pencil-usb-c-features-price-comparison-ipad.html\">new Apple Pencil</a> that sort of falls in between the first- and second-generation models and charges via USB-C.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who has two thumbs and predicted such a dull year for the iPad? This guy! In fact, my predictions column referred to 2023 as “iPad: The Quiet Time,” and wow, that was right. Unfortunately, I couldn’t just take the win and accept that an entire calendar year would pass with no new iPads. So I climbed aboard a unicorn, threw some glitter in the air, and wishcasted myself into predicting a new 15-inch iPad Studio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What part of ‘The Quiet Time’ did you not understand?!</em></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Apple-Pencil-USB-C-sliding-cap.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Pencil USB-C Sliding Cap\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Apple-Pencil-USB-C-sliding-cap.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Apple-Pencil-USB-C-sliding-cap.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Apple-Pencil-USB-C-sliding-cap.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Apple-Pencil-USB-C-sliding-cap.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Apple-Pencil-USB-C-sliding-cap.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Apple-Pencil-USB-C-sliding-cap.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Apple-Pencil-USB-C-sliding-cap.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><figcaption><p>The only noise the iPad made in 2023 was with the release of a third Apple Pencil.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I pretty much struck out when it came to wearables and home, predicting a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2002360/apple-needs-to-totally-rethink-airpods-max.html\">AirPods Max</a> model that didn’t arrive, suggesting the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2114964/apple-watch-series-9-review.html\">Apple Watch Series 9</a> would pick up an Action Button, and perhaps most boldly predicting that Apple “will actually do something new in the home.” Apple did nothing at all new in the home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ready, headset, go!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Did I say Apple would announce an “augmented reality headset”? Yes, indeed, and I’m going to give myself credit for that. Unfortunately, I was way too enthusiastic about all the details of what would become the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-reality-headset-ar-vr-design-features-specs-price.html\">Vision Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, I completely missed the timing of the product announcement: It was summer, not spring. And I thought the product would ship during the summer–when, in fact, as all of us in late 2023 are well aware, it’s not arriving until early 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But perhaps my biggest failed prediction of all was a complete betrayal of my understanding of how Apple prices its products. I always tell people to imagine the absolute most they’d pay for an Apple product, then round up, then tack on a little bit more. Buying a new Apple product <em>hurts</em>. It’s always a little more expensive than we’d like.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Visual-Pro-1-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Vision Pro\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Visual-Pro-1-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Visual-Pro-1-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Visual-Pro-1-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Visual-Pro-1-1.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /><figcaption>The Vision Pro headset   will cost more than anyone thought.</figcaption></figure><p>Petter Ahrnstedt / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But even I couldn’t accept the rumors that the Apple headset could cost as much as $3,000. I just… it… it’s <em>impossible</em> that it would cost that much, right? So I blithely predicted that Apple would shock us all, announcing a headset that cost “less than $2,000.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just to be clear: The Vision Pro absolutely won’t cost $3,000. I got that part right. Unfortunately, I went the wrong way. It’ll start at $3,499, roughly twice as much as I thought it might. I’m happy to take credit when I’m right, but I have to admit it: when I’m wrong, apparently I’m <em>really</em> wrong.</p>\n\nApple Inc</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f6234f2b1ad61610db83cfec5d7b88689bd1773857613160621a396b6d1c9a57","category":"Apple"}
