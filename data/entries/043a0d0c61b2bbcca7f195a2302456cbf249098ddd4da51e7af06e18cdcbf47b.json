By June,\nonly around 8,000 units <em>hadn’t</em> been returned, a source with\ndirect knowledge of sales and return data told me. As of today,\nthe number of units still in customer hands had fallen closer to\n7,000, a source with direct knowledge said. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Once a Humane Pin is returned, the company has no way to refurbish\nit, sources with knowledge of the return process confirmed. The\nPin becomes e-waste, and Humane doesn’t have the opportunity to\nreclaim the revenue by selling it again. The core issue is that\nthere is a T-Mobile limitation that makes it impossible (for now)\nfor Humane to reassign a Pin to a new user once it’s been assigned\nto someone. One source said they don’t believe Humane has disposed\nof the old Pins because “they’re still hopeful they can solve this\nproblem eventually.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Starting to think maybe Humane is in trouble.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/07/verge-humane-returns\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"043a0d0c61b2bbcca7f195a2302456cbf249098ddd4da51e7af06e18cdcbf47b","category":"Tech"}
