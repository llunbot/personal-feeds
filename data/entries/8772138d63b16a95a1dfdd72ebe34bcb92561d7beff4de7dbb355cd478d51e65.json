Once, we might have attributed the success of their trademark solo attacks to perfectly-timed moves or superior tactical nous. Yet while this is certainly part of the winning formula, Brown and Evenepoel’s recent time trial performances have shown that their ability to hold off a hungry chasing peloton in road races is about far more lucky timing.</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>Individual time trials are widely regarded as the race of truth. It’s one rider battling against both the clock and themselves – a mental battle as much as a physical one. It’s about being able to push the limits without having anyone to race against. Above all, it’s pure power; cycling in its rawest, most difficult form. Aerodynamics and pacing strategies play a part, but the winner of an individual time trial can’t rely on tactics or outwitting their opponents. They must be the strongest. This is something that Brown and Evenepoel have proven, beyond any doubt, over the last two months.</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/AW6_2255_1024x1024.jpg?v=1727088891\" /></div>\n<p><span>Now, both riders have written themselves into the history books with Olympic and World Championship doubles. Their respective abilities to hold their form and stay focused even after their successes in Paris is a testament to their mental fortitude. </span></p>\n<p><span>On the technical, rolling and challenging course around Zurich last weekend, Brown and Evenepoel found themselves able to dig deeper than their competitors, riding a rainbow wave to the top step of the podium. Both of their positions were perfectly dialled and their split times came as no surprise as they steadily obliterated their rivals over their respective distances. Once each rider crossed the finish line and their positions were confirmed, we were left feeling as if there should never have been any doubt in their abilities to take victory at all. However, while their riding styles and physical abilities are uncannily similar, their World Championship titles represent something very different for Brown and Evenepoel.</span></p>\n<p><span>For the Australian woman, an Olympic gold medal and rainbow jersey is a fairytale ending to a supreme career. Brown’s 2024 campaign was already off to a flying start back in April when she won <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/liege-bastogne-liege-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-oldest-monument?srsltid=AfmBOorCHpsPyjxS9AsaxLWti5CbkAlMdZDYeruNkY4LLIFthGTj07Tu\">Liège-Bastogne-Liège</a> Femmes, outsprinting the likes of Elisa Longo Borghini and Demi Vollering after spending 70 kilometres in a breakaway of six. She’s also proven herself to be a valuable teammate when riding for FDJ-Suez, using her endurance and sustained power to control breakaways and keep her team’s general classification riders safe in the peloton. When the Olympics came round in July, plenty of talk surrounded the Dutch team’s powerhouses like Ellen van Dijk and Vollering, but Brown proved herself faster than them all, proudly representing Australia on the world stage. She then did it all again in Zurich. She is golden Grace, rainbow Grace, the woman who will retire at the very top of her game.</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/ES025509_1024x1024.jpg?v=1727088944\" /></div>\n<p><span>Contrastingly, Evenepoel’s second time trial world title is an ominous warning to the rest of the men’s peloton. While Brown will bow out at the end of this season, Evenepoel is only 24 years old and his career is still in its relative infancy. It has been less than five years since Evenepoel signed his first professional contract and he’s already won the time trial World Championships twice, the road race once, two Olympic gold medals and the <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/vuelta-a-espana\">Vuelta a España</a>. Despite a mishap at the start of his time trial in Zurich which caused him to drop his chain on the start ramp (meaning Evenepoel did the entire course without a power meter), the Belgian still crossed the line with time to celebrate. His gold bike glistened in the afternoon sun and Evenepoel’s victory salute seemed to say: </span><i><span>watch out everyone, I’m stronger than ever</span></i><span>. As the World Championship road race looms in less than a week’s time, it’s hard to bet against Evenepoel winning that too. Two Olympic gold medals and two world titles in one year – it would be quite the season.</span></p>\n<p><span>While individual time trials can be thought of as relatively dull events to watch as a spectator, there can be no denying the significance of this year’s World Championships. Although they are at radically different stages of their careers, both Brown and Evenepoel are two worthy winners who have shown themselves to have a special, unique set of skills compared to the rest of the field. Whether it's in long solo breakaways in road races or in the aerodynamic tuck of their time trial bikes, these are athletes who are born to ride alone, who don't need others to spur them on, who can win battles against themselves. We have crowned our individual time trial king and queen.</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"8772138d63b16a95a1dfdd72ebe34bcb92561d7beff4de7dbb355cd478d51e65","category":"Cycling"}
