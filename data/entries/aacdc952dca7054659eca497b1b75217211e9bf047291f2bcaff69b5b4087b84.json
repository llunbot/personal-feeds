{"title":"Rare sale cuts the price of Apple’s latest Magic Mouse with USB-C","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2787424/rare-sale-cuts-the-price-of-apples-latest-magic-mouse-with-usb-c.html","date":1747710914000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s something magic about Apple’s mouse—besides its name—and it’s the beautiful mix of design, usability, and perfect integration with every other Apple product you own. What makes this even better is that <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DL72PK1P\">you can get one for $68 right now, </a>which is only $11 off but one of the few sales we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s Magic Mouse has a beautiful, sleek design that will fit nicely into your hand, gliding effortlessly over any surface. The mouse features a multi-touch surface that allows gestures, which come in handy if you want to swipe between web pages, for instance. The mouse comes with a rechargeable battery, so you’ll have to plug this in to charge about once a month, but you can use USB-C now, as Apple swapped out the Lightning port last year. The annoying part about it is that the charging port is on its belly, so you can’t use it while it refills its battery, but you only need to charge it for a few minutes to get hours of use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you’ve had your eye on the Magic Mouse, but didn’t want to pay full price, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DL72PK1P\">getting it for $68</a> is as good of a deal as you’re likely to get. So go grab one before the price jumps back up.</p>\n\n\n<span>Snag a Magic Mouse in this rare sale</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DL72PK1P\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"aacdc952dca7054659eca497b1b75217211e9bf047291f2bcaff69b5b4087b84","category":"Apple"}
