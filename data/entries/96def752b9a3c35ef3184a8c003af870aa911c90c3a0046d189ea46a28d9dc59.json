But, anodized silver or polished aluminum bike parts are just flat-out classy! PNW Components knows this (obviously) as they just released a limited run of anodized silver Loam and Rainier Dropper posts – and they’re only $10 more than the originals.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PNW-LTD-Loam-Rainier-Droppers-Loam-from-the-front-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PNW-LTD-Loam-Rainier-Droppers-Loam-from-the-front-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"PNW LTD Loam &amp; Rainier Droppers Loam from the front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PNW-LTD-Loam-Rainier-Droppers-Loam-from-the-front-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PNW-LTD-Loam-Rainier-Droppers-Loam-from-the-front-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PNW-LTD-Loam-Rainier-Droppers-Loam-from-the-front-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PNW-LTD-Loam-Rainier-Droppers-Loam-from-the-front-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PNW-LTD-Loam-Rainier-Droppers-Loam-from-the-front-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PNW-LTD-Loam-Rainier-Droppers-Loam-from-the-front-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / PNW Components)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These are some handsome droppers, with an interesting shine.

The stanchions typically use a coating called Hard Anodizing, or Type III Ano, which usually is only available in black and often 2-5 x thicker than more common Type II anodizing. That meant PNW had to work with their factory to not only develop a silver hard anodized finish, but a testing process to guarantee it would hold up to the abuse. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That need for testing led to a system they developed with a “container filled with mud” around the midcap and stanchion, through which they cycled the post up and down “tens of thousands of times.” In their testing with this method, Type II anodizing quickly wore through while the new silver hard ano did not. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>PNW LTD Loam Dropper Specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $219</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cartridge Style: Adjustable air cartridge</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Routing Method: Internal</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Diameters: 30.9, 31.6</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Travel: 150mm, 170mm, 200mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stanchion Diameter: 26mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lever Compatibility: All PNW levers and most cable-actuated levers from other brands</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cable and Housing: Cable and housing are included only with the purchase of a lever kit</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>PNW LTD Rainier 27.2 Dropper Specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $209</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Routing Method: Internal</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Diameters: 27.2</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Travel: 125mm, 100mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stanchion Diameter: 22mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Seatpost material: 7075 Alloy</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lever Compatibility: All PNW levers and most cable-actuated levers from other brands</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cable and Housing: Cable and housing are included only with the purchase of a lever kit</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PNW-LTD-Loam-Rainier-Droppers-Loam-non-drive-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PNW-LTD-Loam-Rainier-Droppers-Loam-non-drive-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"PNW LTD Loam &amp; Rainier Droppers Loam non-drive\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PNW-LTD-Loam-Rainier-Droppers-Loam-non-drive-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PNW-LTD-Loam-Rainier-Droppers-Loam-non-drive-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PNW-LTD-Loam-Rainier-Droppers-Loam-non-drive-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PNW-LTD-Loam-Rainier-Droppers-Loam-non-drive-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PNW-LTD-Loam-Rainier-Droppers-Loam-non-drive-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PNW-LTD-Loam-Rainier-Droppers-Loam-non-drive-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.pnwcomponents.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PNWComponents.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pnw-limited-edition-silver-dropper-posts/\">PNW Drops Limited Edition Silver Dropper Posts with Loam &amp; Rainier Models</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"96def752b9a3c35ef3184a8c003af870aa911c90c3a0046d189ea46a28d9dc59","category":"Cycling"}
