This made Android folks unwelcome in many a group chat, but Apple finally started rectifying this issue last year with the addition of RCS support in iOS. It has been a slow rollout, though, with Google's mobile service only now getting support.</p>\n<p>While Apple supports RCS messaging on iPhones now, it has not exactly been enthusiastic about it. Anyone using Google Fi on an iPhone was left in the lurch even after Apple changed course. The first RCS update rolled out in iOS 18 last fall, but it only supported postpaid plans on the big three carriers. Everyone else was left waiting, including Google Fi, as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/ios-18-brings-rcs-to-major-carrier-iphones-but-prepaid-plans-are-still-waiting/\">confirmed to Ars</a> last year. It was a suitably amusing outcome, considering Google is largely responsible for reviving the RCS standard and runs the Jibe back-end servers through which many iPhone RCS messages flow.</p>\n<p>Slowly but surely, Apple is making good on its promises to enable RCS. The company <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/apple-updates-all-its-operating-systems-brings-apple-intelligence-to-vision-pro/\">released iOS 18.4 this week</a>, and hiding amid the control center tweaks and priority notifications is support for RCS on Google Fi and other T-Mobile MVNOs. Some users spotted this feature in the recent beta releases, but the servers that handle RCS for Google's mobile service were not yet connectable. With the final release, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/fi/thread/335006509/rcs-messages-is-now-available-for-ios\">Google has confirmed</a> that RCS is ready at last.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/google-fi-users-on-iphone-finally-get-rcs-messaging/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/google-fi-users-on-iphone-finally-get-rcs-messaging/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b16391c08c56aa59628f68a0a1f9c14ba6aead215f045ac34eb4b445dfd3b950","category":"Tech"}
