It also argued that a divestiture was “simply not possible,” especially within the law’s 270-day timeline, pointing to difficulties such as Beijing’s refusal to sell a key feature that powers TikTok in the United States.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Must be nice for a Chinese company to be able to sue the government and make arguments on freedom of speech grounds.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/07/tiktok-sues-us-government\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2e829c8dd62b91fd2f5bb7d7d5a5eb78ad94ca85e47958f2b6a52d93b06112fe","category":"Tech"}
