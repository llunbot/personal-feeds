Under the hood, there’s an S8 SiP processor—the same you can get in the Apple Watch Series 8 and original Apple Watch Ultra, so it’s going to be fast and capable no matter what you want your watch to do. You can get about 18 hours of battery life from a single charge, so it’ll last from morning to night—or through the night for sleep tracking with a quick 1-hour charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ736JM/\">Apple Watch SE is a greater starter watch for $80 off</a> that will bring you everything you need without adding tons of pricey bells and whistles.
