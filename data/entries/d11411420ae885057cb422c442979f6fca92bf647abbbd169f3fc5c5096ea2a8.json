With the Home app, the company decided that someone has to be invited to be a member of the household within the app to have access to accessories’ controls. Each person invited to a Home defined in the Home app has access to all the accessories within the home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what if you need to give someone limited access? Apple added a new option to the Home app in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15 Sequoia that should address many use cases but still leaves room for more improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In these September 2024 operating system updates, Apple redefines household members as Residents in Home Settings for a given defined home. That allows them to add a new category of guests. Guests can’t access most accessories, but you can choose to let them control HomeKit-enabled automatic doors (like a garage door), door locks, and alarm systems, including defining periods when they’re allowed to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To add a guest, follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>In the Home app, tap or click the plus sign in the upper-right corner and choose <em>Add People</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap or click <em>Guest</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Start typing someone’s name or email address. Available addresses—ones associated with an iCloud account—will light up in orange; the others will be in dark gray.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap or click one or more iCloud-enabled accounts.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap or click <em>Next</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choose a schedule other than Anytime by tapping or clicking <em>Edit</em> and then using the options to narrow down access periods.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choose which automatic doors, locks, and alarm systems they have access to.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap or click Invite and an invitation is sent.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The guest must accept the invitation to gain access. You can revoke access through Home Settings (tap or click the More […] icon).</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/mac911-home-guest-sbs-mw.png?w=1200\" alt=\"Home guest access\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/mac911-home-guest-sbs-mw.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/mac911-home-guest-sbs-mw.png?resize=300%2C181&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/mac911-home-guest-sbs-mw.png?resize=768%2C463&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/mac911-home-guest-sbs-mw.png?resize=1200%2C724&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"724\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Start by choosing Guest (left); choose accessories and set a schedule (middle); they then appear as Guest (or Invitation Pending until they accept) alongside Resident (for people in your household).</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This guest access doesn’t let them use the Home app to turn on and off lights, power outlets on and off, control a thermostat, or use other accessories. Make sure if you’re using this guest feature to let a house sitter, contractor, or cleaner into your home that they have other ways to control lights and devices they need access to. Most HomeKit outlets have manual buttons that can be pressed, for instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also set up an automation that you enable only when you’re away, and someone is coming to the house so that, for instance, unlocking the front door also turns on lights, kicks up the heat or AC, and activates other useful accessories. You can disable that automation manually at other times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can change guest parameters or delete the entry at any time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
