The 20-year-old will join from ProTeam Alpecin Fenix at the end of the season.</p>\n<p>The two-time Junior Cyclocross World Champion went professional straight from the junior ranks in 2020 and is tipped as one of Britain's next Grand Tour hopefuls. He will join the likes of Ethan Hayter and Tom Pidcock as the current crop of young home talent riding for the British WorldTour team.</p>\n<p>'It’s been the team I’ve always looked up to,' said Tulett on signing with the team.</p>\n<p>'I still remember reading <em>Cycling Weekly</em> when I was younger, looking at the photos of the team being launched. It was the first time that there was this big British team going into the WorldTour and I remember being so excited about it.</p>\n<p>'Then Brad won the Tour in 2012 and that was just incredible. I remember thinking, \"I’d love to be on that team one day\". Fast forward nine years and I’ve just signed my first contract here. I couldn’t be happier.</p>\n<p>'I remember visiting the Vuelta in 2017 as a fan and seeing Chris Froome and the whole team, thinking, one day… I want my seat on that bus. It’s honestly been in my head during some training efforts – I want to earn my seat on that bus.'</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/913/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2021: Route, teams and all you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/10017/flanders-uci-road-cycling-world-championships-2021-key-information\">Flanders UCI Road Cycling World Championships 2021: Key information</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/10060/human-rights-campaigner-calls-on-cycling-industry-to-help-female-riders-fleeing\">Human rights campaigner calls on cycling industry to help female riders fleeing Afghanistan</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nTulett has already caught the eye in his two-year stint at Alpecin-Fenix. This season alone, the Kent-based rider took ninth overall at the Tour of Poland, 17th at Amstel Gold Race and 12th at Fleche Wallonne. </p>\n<p>It was performances like these that made the Ineos hierarchy take notice, with director of performance Rod Ellingworth saying, 'Ben is a young British rider who we’ve been watching for a while. He has made impressive progress over the last year and his approach and attitude is exactly what we look for in an Ineos Grenadier.</p>\n<p>'We think his passion for racing combined with our team environment will help push him on to the next stage of his career.'</p>\n<p><a href=\"/in-depth/8870/cyclist-magazine-podcast-episode-14-ben-tulett-the-next-big-thing-in-british-cycling\">Talking to <em>Cyclist </em>earlier last year</a>, Tulett said that his '<span>ambition is to ultimately be a GC rider, that has been my goal and dream since I began cycling, to compete in a Grand Tour has always been the biggest dream', and that the Tour de France would be his ultimate goal.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong>Listen to our podcast with Ben Tulett from late last year below!</strong></em></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"8551fac2666d356d4fae4b6969424bee2c5b65e5941f14c295f33613c566922d","category":"Cycling"}
