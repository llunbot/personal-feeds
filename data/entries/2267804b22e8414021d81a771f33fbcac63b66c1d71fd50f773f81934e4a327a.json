The most common forms included having health concerns ignored or dismissed (10 percent), being shouted at or scolded (7 percent), having their physical privacy violated (5 percent), and having a provider threaten to withhold treatment or force them to accept unwanted treatment (5 percent). Additionally, nearly 30 percent of survey takers reported experiencing discrimination during their maternity care, including their race, age, weight, and income.</p>\n<p>Black, Hispanic, and multi-racial mothers reported the highest rates of mistreatment and discrimination. These racial disparities mirror disparities seen in pregnancy outcomes; mothers in these groups face the highest maternal mortality rates in the country. Black mothers, for instance, are <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthequity/features/maternal-mortality/index.html\">three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes</a> than white mothers.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962480#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962480&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2267804b22e8414021d81a771f33fbcac63b66c1d71fd50f773f81934e4a327a","category":"Tech"}
