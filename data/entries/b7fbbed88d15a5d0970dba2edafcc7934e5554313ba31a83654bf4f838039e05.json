It's called the ZDX, and it's the product of a partnership between Honda (which owns Acura) and General Motors, using the latter company's new battery platform and battery EV architecture. Acura says the first customer deliveries should begin in early 2024, with single-motor versions priced at around $60,000.</p>\n<p>\"The arrival of the new ZDX is an exciting moment for the Acura brand,\" said Assistant Vice President of Acura National Sales Emile Korkor. \"It signals our transition to a zero-emissions future and demonstrates our commitment to precision crafted performance in the electrified era.\"</p>\n<p>Honda is still at work developing an in-house EV architecture it can use for North American vehicles, but it has also partnered with GM to create a range of other EVs for this market. The ZDX and the related Honda Prologue, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/12/heres-how-hondas-next-electric-suv-was-designed-during-the-pandemic/\">which we got a preview of last year</a>, are the first two, but in the coming years, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/04/honda-and-general-motors-will-collaborate-on-affordable-evs-from-2027/\">we also expect to see some smaller, affordable EVs</a> as a result of the collaboration.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961507#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961507&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
