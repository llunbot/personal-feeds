His official time has not yet been confirmed by officials on site. If that unofficial time stands, he is the first to break the four-minute barrier over four kilometers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Honestly, it was brutal,” Lambie said of his effort on Wednesday. “I’ve been doing a lot more anaerobic capacity and strength work to hit that power! Which also means when your legs lock up, they lock up hard. I hate making a scene and having someone peel me off the bike, but I was wrecked.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lambie rode a 64×15 gear for the record-setting ride.

His previous best time of 4:03.640 was set at the Berlin track, not the high-altitude boards of Mexico city. The Aguascalientes track sits at 1,800 m, or 5,900 feet, and is known to be the fastest track in the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Lambie-pursuit-world-record-1-of-2-1340x893.jpg\" /><figcaption>Lambie just after his effort.

That record has since tumbled as Lambie and Italian Filippo Ganna dropped it lower and lower. Prior to Lambie’s effort Wednesday, Ganna held the record with a time of 4:01.934.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This story is developing, check back for more.</em></p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/ashton-lambie-breaks-four-minute-pursuit-barrier/\">Read More</a>","author":"Caley Fretz","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"21e2baa1fd206ac65bab348713580bfd7cee0f3619d83a989390c562ecc45022","category":"Cycling"}
