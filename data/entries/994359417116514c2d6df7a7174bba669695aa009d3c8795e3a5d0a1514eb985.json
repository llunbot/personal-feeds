Apple says the Home app will support the \"core functionality\" of robot vacuum cleaners, such as vacuuming, mopping, power control, cleaning mode, and charge status. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple said at WWDC in June that the iOS 18 feature would arrive <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/ios-18-preferred-home-hub/\">later in 2024</a> – presumably with iOS 18.2, due this month – but that's apparently no longer the case. Apple tweaked a footnote on the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/home-app/\">Home app webpage</a> in early November, signaling the delay. When it does arrive, controlling robot vacuums with Siri will initially be available in English (U.S.) only.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/02/apple-homekit-robot-vacuum-support-2025/\">Apple Nudges HomeKit Robot Vacuum Support Rollout to Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-nudges-homekit-robot-vacuum-support-rollout-to-next-year.2444439/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"994359417116514c2d6df7a7174bba669695aa009d3c8795e3a5d0a1514eb985","category":"Apple"}
