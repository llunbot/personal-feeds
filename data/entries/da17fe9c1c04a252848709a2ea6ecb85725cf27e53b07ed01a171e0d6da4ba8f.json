In a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/60-minute-turbo-training-sessions/\">60-minute turbo training session</a>, you can ride for up to 50 minutes (allowing for a short warm-up and cool down) in zone 3, for example.</p>\n<p>Research from the Odense University in Denmark demonstrates how steady workouts can have a more beneficial effect on a rider’s stamina too.</p>\n<p>After five weeks, cyclists who’d ridden steadily – at 80 to 90 per cent of their <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/vo2-max/#:~:text=What's%20a%20good%20VO2%20max%3F&amp;text=The%20average%20sedentary%20male%20has,70ml%2Fkg%2Fmin%20respectively.\">VO2 max </a>for 30 minutes per workout – measured a six per cent increase in their VO2 max scores against a group who did interval sessions and failed to raise their aerobic capacity at all.</p>\n<h3>Hit the sweetspot</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" title=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> If you can’t get out for hours, ride at the ‘sweetspot’ just below your lactate threshold.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Paul Mill, of Elite Cycling Performance Coaching, coached Reza Pakravan to a world-record crossing of the Sahara desert by bike on less than 12 hours’ training per week.</p>\n<p>“The word ‘endurance’ really is associated with hours in the saddle – and for riders with some blocks of time to commit, then endurance-boosting should be built upon <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/base-training-cycling/\">steady, aerobic-based rides</a>,” says Mill.</p>\n<p>But if going at a higher intensity, as per <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/sweetspot-training/\">sweetspot training</a>, because you have limited time, has its merits, why doesn’t everyone just do it this way and save time?</p>\n<p>“Because one major drawback with working at even a slightly higher intensity is that you become fatigued more rapidly than a rider training at a slightly lower level,” he explains.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Santa Cruz Bullit CC S full suspension mountain eBike\" title=\"Santa Cruz Bullit CC S -
