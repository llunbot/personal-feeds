In the late '80s, I was too young to buy magazines to find out what games deserved my hard-earned pocket-money. So, in an experience all too familiar to many millennial gamers, I used my (poor) intuition to look at the box art to decide what to bring home.</p>\n<p>At the time, a console title cost something in the realm of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/the-return-of-the-70-video-game-has-been-a-long-time-coming/\" target=\"_blank\">$100</a> in today's dollars (or over €85-95), which made each game purchase an investment requiring long consideration and thoughtful planning.

Most games achieved this with the good old “Nintendo-hard” philosophy: Brutal challenges make a relative dearth of original content last longer.</p>\n<p>In those days, buying a game felt like being given rare access to a magical kingdom, paying a dear price for access behind golden gates instead of trying to catch a glimpse from the outside. Getting a game was an all-too-sacred ritual involving a mystical and intimate relationship with store owners who, on average, were just interested in duping naive children into buying whatever leftover stock the store had lying around.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790334#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790334&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"65b6442ec3aa0bb3620f26b5801253fb44e34e3a507db04ecb10f639416b993d","category":"Tech"}
