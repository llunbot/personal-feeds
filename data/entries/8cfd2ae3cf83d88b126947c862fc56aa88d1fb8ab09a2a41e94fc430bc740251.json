Now, freshly-leaked CAD files\nhave corroborated our report and offered a closer look at the\nnew design.</p>\n\n<p>This year’s phones will adopt new solid-state buttons with haptic\nfeedback, similar to the Home button introduced with iPhone 7.\nThis means that the buttons will no longer have moving parts and\nwill identify the pressure level to work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I trust Apple on this, because they absolutely nailed it with the iPhone 7 home button. That button was better than the buttons that actually clicked. Same thing for Apple’s modern trackpads — their simulated haptics clicks are better than the old trackpads that actually clicked. But I’m damn curious about two things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>How will the mute switch work? It’s a real benefit that you can discern the current state of the mute switch by feel alone, while the iPhone remains in your pocket or purse. (And lo these many years later, I still remain baffled that among all the umpteen design elements that Android phones have copied from iPhones, no popular or even semi-popular Android phones have ever had hardware mute switches. Not even <a href=\"https://us.nothing.tech/pages/phone-1\">Nothing</a>, whose first phone unapologetically apes the iPhone frame.)</p></li>\n<li><p>How will these haptic buttons work with cases? Is pressure sensitivity enough? Or will iPhone 15 cases need to have pass-through capacitive buttons?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/21/solid-state-iphone-15-buttons\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8cfd2ae3cf83d88b126947c862fc56aa88d1fb8ab09a2a41e94fc430bc740251","category":"Tech"}
