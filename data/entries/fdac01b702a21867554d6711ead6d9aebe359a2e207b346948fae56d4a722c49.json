The origins of the town date back to the seventh century when it was founded as a monastery by Saint Romaric and Saint Amé, which grew around the abbey, highlighting the town's religious and cultural history. To celebrate Remiremont's community spirit, each year the town comes alive with its traditional carnival which is inspired by the famous Carnival of Venice, known for its elaborate masks, opulent costumes, and festive atmosphere. Across several days, there are parades and processions that wind through the streets of Remiremont. But this year, the carnival won’t be the only time of year when there will be a procession through town, however, this celebration will be on two wheels as the Women’s WorldTour rides out of Remiremont towards Morteau.  </span></p>\n<p><span>It’s the last of the hilly stages before the big mountains come into view, so the last chance for the puncheurs of the peloton to secure a stage win if they have not done so far. The stage totals 2,234 metres of climbing, but most of it is packed into the second half of the stage with one category four climb, two category threes, and one category two. The only climb in the first half of the stage is the Col du Mont de Fourche, a 3.2km climb with an average gradient of 5.9%, 11.7km into the race. The second half will wear down the legs of the riders, ruling out a bunch sprint in Marteau. The La Roche du Prêtre is the toughest climb of the day, which is 30km from the finish, and is 5.5km-long with an average gradient of 5.6%. After the final climb, the Côte des Fins, it is a descent into a flat finish, so could we see a solo winner or a sprint from a select group of escapees?</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/tdff_6.jpg?v=1721827899\" /></div>\n<p><i><span>Stage profile sourced via ASO </span></i></p>\n<h3><strong>Contenders</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><span>Liane Lippert </span></strong><span>and</span><strong><span> Emma Norsgaard</span></strong><span> are riders who Movistar will pin hopes on winning a stage. Both riders won stages last year, Noorsgard in solo fashion (something she could try and repeat on stage six of this year's race) and Lippert in a sprint. Lippert was third on stage five with Norsgaard sixth, so both are showing good signs of winning form. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Kristen Faulkner</span></strong><span> (EF Education-Oatly-Cannondale) is still showing her strength post-Olympics triumphs. The American has just been outside the podium, once on the ITT and then came fourth in the challenging stage five, but she does sit second on the GC. However, with this being the last chance for one of the team's riders to secure a victory before the big mountain stages, we expect she'll be an active rider on this stage. They also have </span><strong><span>Noemi Rüegg</span></strong><span>, who placed fifth on the lumpy stage to Liège, as well as </span><strong><span>Magdeleine Vallieres</span></strong><span> and </span><strong><span>Alison Jackson</span></strong><span>. </span></p>\n<p><span>Fenix-Deceuninck continues to be very active throughout this race and stage six provides them with another opportunity for a stage win. </span><strong><span>Puck Pieterse</span></strong><span> continues to lead in the polka dot jersey, but only by one point, and with five categorised climbs littered throughout this stage, we expect she'll want to get into the break. Last year's stage winner </span><strong><span>Yara Kastelijn</span></strong><span> could be a rider for the team, as could </span><strong><span>Pauliena Rooijakkers</span></strong><span>. </span></p>\n<p><span>Visma-Lease a Bike's </span><strong><span>Fem Van Empel</span></strong><span> could also be a contender. She looked good in the three-rider break which formed on stage five featuring </span><strong><span>Loes Adegeest</span></strong><span> (FDJ-Suez) and </span><strong><span>Julie Van de Velde</span></strong><span> (AG Insurance-Soudal Team), who could also be celebrating a stage win on this stage. For Lidl-Trek, </span><strong><span>Lucinda Brand</span></strong><span> could also be a contender to get into the break and go all the way to the line. </span></p>\n<p><span>Yellow jersey </span><strong><span>Kasia Niewiadoma</span></strong><span> (Canyon//SRAM) does have the option to race this stage more defensively</span><span>, but she</span><span> is a rider who puts in the effort and therefore, could take this opportunity to widen the gap between herself and</span><strong><span> Demi Vollering</span></strong><span> (SD Worx-Protime), her main rival in this race, who sits 1:19 behind the Pole. Depending on how Vollering feels after the crash she was involved in on stage five, she may try to solo herself to victory to get herself back into yellow before the final weekend. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Stage six winner prediction</strong></h3>\n<p>We're back <strong>Emma Norsgaard</strong> to take the stage win in Morteau. </p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"fdac01b702a21867554d6711ead6d9aebe359a2e207b346948fae56d4a722c49","category":"Cycling"}
