Hood. Or maybe over to the Columbia River Gorge, the high deserts of Bend, and the towering old-growth conifer stands of Oakridge.</p>\n<p>And while off-road riding in the Coast Range west of us can open up a host of appealing options—particularly for those of us looking to explore an endless labyrinth of gravel logging roads—the Oregon coast has generally lacked in notable destination riding unless you’re fat biking on the beach, or making a sojourn down the Pacific Coast Highway.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3418.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3418.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3418.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3418.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3418.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>So when an invitation came through to venture to the Southern Oregon Coast outside of Coos Bay, to spend a weekend familiarizing myself with the Whiskey Run Trail System, and sample some of the other wonders of this perhaps less destined zone in our fair Beaver State, I was all in.</p>\n<p>Coos Bay is roughly a four-hour drive from Portland. So, while not likely a spot you’re going on a day trip to from the city, it’s a worthy destination for a weekend or even an ambitious overnighter. With a manageable trek down the I-5 corridor and then a gorgeous winding road west across the Southern Willamette Valley through the Siuslaw National Forest, it’s just a quick jaunt down the iconic Hwy 101 through Florence while skirting the windswept Oregon Dunes National Recreation area. And you’ve arrived at the harbor town of Coos Bay.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-283.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-283.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-283.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-283.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-283.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://travelsouthernoregoncoast.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Travel Southern Oregon Coast</a> organization had put together a thorough sampling of activities for the weekend for a group of us, based out of <a href=\"https://baypointlanding.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bay Point Landing</a> – a recently established RV campground, with resort amenities and airstream and cabin rentals on site.</p>\n<p>Situated on the slough between the Pacific and the mouth of the Coos River, the property was well-appointed with modern communal spaces for remote work and socializing.

Because of its location on the captivating Oregon Coast, within striking distance of both Portland and San Francisco, the community and surrounding area are poised for an inevitable swelling in their annual visitors. And those visitors are middle-aged, they’ve got resources and they like to play.</p>\n<p>Organizations like Travel Southern Oregon recognize the opportunities that these factors play in helping to stimulate their local communities, grow local small businesses, and foster an environment where Coos Bay and the surrounding area can affirm itself as a regional hub for outdoor recreational tourism.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-1318.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-1318.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-1318.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-1318.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-1318.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-1246.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-1246.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-1246.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-1246.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-1246.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/outdoor-recreation/bicycling/whiskey-run-mtb-system/\" target=\"_blank\">Whiskey Run Trail</a> system was conceived of, built, and expanded upon with this foresight.

More recent timber harvesting operations provided some vantages to briefly poke our heads out of the forest and gaze out on the infinite blue expanse of the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-2742.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-2742.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-2742.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-2742.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-2742.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>For a closer view on that Pacific expanse, our weekend itinerary also included a late afternoon watercolor painting session led by the humble and talented artist <a href=\"http://chrismcnally.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chris McNally</a>– who had gotten involved with the Whiskey Run system and Travel Southern Oregon earlier on to help them with some work for a system trail map, a label for the local <a href=\"https://7devilsbrewery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Seven Devils Brewery</a>, and a local tourism campaign.</p>\n<p>Our time with Chris out at Shore Acres Park, just a stone’s throw from Whiskey Run was a gratifying change of pace from the attention required to safely navigate some of Whiskey Run’s more challenging terrain.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-2870.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-2870.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-2870.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-2870.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-2870.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3084.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3084.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3084.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3084.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3084.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Basing out of the SF bay area, Chris has carved out a solid reputation for himself through the vibrancy of his art, as well as his focused work alongside a host of highly recognizable businesses and brands, particularly within the cycling industry. A natural educator, and a genuine pleasure to spend a few unwinding hours in a day with, Chris put us at ease and encouraged those of us with little to no watercolor experience (myself certainly included) to step outside of ourselves for a bit and work toward transferring some scenes from that gorgeous landscape down onto paper.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3427.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3427.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3427.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3427.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3427.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>To cap off an action-packed weekend of MTBing, kayaking, and watercoloring, we culminated our festivities with a stop off at the Seven Devils Brewery in downtown Coos Bay to enjoy some live music, outdoor BBQ, and the release of their ‘Gnome Wrecker IPA’- sharing a name with the same trail that we had en masse, laid waste to earlier that same weekend.</p>\n<p>Turnout for the festivities was impressive, and while some were certainly in attendance to imbibe and enjoy a beautiful evening outside- many were there to show their support for the work that had been ongoing at the local trail system. What continues to become clearer to me, through travels, and time spent in both small towns and big cities, both here in the States and overseas, is that bikes bring out good people in our communities.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3683.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3683.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3683.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3683.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3683.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3834.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3834.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3834.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3834.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3834.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3617.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3617.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3617.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3617.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/23_0721_Whiskey_Run_-3617.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>And they’re not always even riders. They bring out the hard-working, the crafty, and the industrious bunch who celebrate that virtue of riding, and recognize that cycling has an inherent positive impact on communities that embrace it, create infrastructure for it, and allocate resources to foster its growth for locals and visitors, of all ages, backgrounds and abilities. I’m pleased to have found another place in Oregon that is evolving, and which seems to have gotten their arms around these ideals.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/southern-oregon-coast-riding/\">Southern Oregon’s Coastal Treasures: Riding Whiskey Run Singletrack</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Josh Weinberg","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"4a9d041dd70531a0dc335857cb9ac81f31ffcf02728964511788161836510c8f","category":"Cycling"}
