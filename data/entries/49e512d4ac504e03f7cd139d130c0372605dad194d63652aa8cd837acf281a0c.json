Stage 9 of the 2020 Tour de France began in Pau, where the racing was non-stop from the moment the flag was dropped. Marc Hirschi went solo early and was only caught by the GC favourites with a few kilometres left, where his now teammate Tadej <span>Pogačar </span>sprinted to the first Tour stage win in his career. If this year’s stage is as dramatic as that, you won’t catch us complaining.</span></p>\n<p><span>Two categorised climbs are present in the first 55km, though they are both fourth category and less than 3km in length. The ‘real’ climbing begins with one of the most famous Tour de France climbs: the Col du Tourmalet. Peaking at over 2,100 metres above sea level, the Tourmalet is a brute.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/rouleur-explore/riding-the-queen-stage-of-the-2021-tour-de-france\">Related – Riding Stage 18 of the Tour de France</a></strong></em></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/TDF21_ETP18_PROFILS_PARTICULIERS_COL_DU_TOURMALET_600x600.jpg?v=1626186517\" /></div>\n<p><span></span><em><span>Col du Tourmalet profile</span></em></p>\n<p><span>It is over 17km long and averages more than 7% throughout. The Tourmalet was one of the first mountains to be used in the Tour de France in the early 1900s. More recently, it was ascended in 2019, where Thibaut Pinot climbed to the top first.</span></p>\n<p><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/20190720TDF1033-A.S.O._Pauline_BALLET-min_1024x1024.jpg?v=1626185977\" />Thibaut Pinot winning atop the Col du Tourmalet in 2019 (Image credit: A.S.O./Pauline BALLET)</span></i></p>\n<p><span>This year, however, the stage doesn’t end atop the Tourmalet. Instead, the riders will descend to the final mountain of the 2021 Tour de France: Luz Ardiden. The climb is 13.3km in length and averages a gradient of 7.4%. </span>The mountain has been used at the Tour de France before, but nowhere near as often as the preceding Tourmalet. Samuel Sánchez was the last winner when the Tour visited the climb in 2011.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/TDF21_ETP18_PROFILS_PARTICULIERS_LUZ_ARDIDEN_600x600.jpg?v=1626186553\" /></div>\n<div><em>Luz Ardiden profile</em></div>\n<br />\n<div><span></span></div>\n<div>Both mountains are hors catégorie, which means there are plenty of points available in the king of the mountains competition. Wout Poels currently holds the <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/the-polka-dot-jersey-at-the-tour-de-france-a-brief-history\">polka-dot jersey</a>, but Wout van Aert, Mike Woods and Nairo Quintana have all expressed a clear interest in the jersey and will closely follow Poels.</div>\n<div>\n<br />In the GC, it’s the final chance for the contenders to make an impression in the mountains. This will encourage some riders, particularly those that are less confident time-trialists, to ride aggressively and attack early. We can hope for, and almost expect fireworks in the Pyrenees.<span></span>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<h4><b>Contenders</b></h4>\n<p><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1233955085-min_1024x1024.jpg?v=1626185263\" />Image credit: THOMAS SAMSON/AFP via Getty Images</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Tadej <span>Pogačar </span></b><span>remains in the lead of the Tour de France with a huge margin in hand. This means that he doesn’t need to be aggressive and can instead follow his rivals’ wheels to protect against losing time. This dynamic means that UAE Team Emirates will be left to control the tempo in the peloton. If <span>Pogačar </span>feels strong enough to win, there’s a chance he could put his team to the front to keep the breakaway in check. Afterall, UAE are one of the only teams with all eight riders that started the Tour still present.</span></p>\n<p><span>Unlike UAE, Jumbo-Visma are heavily depleted having lost <span>Primož Roglič</span>, Robert Gesink and Tony Martin. However, </span><b>Wout van Aert </b><span>and </span><b>Sepp Kuss have</b><span> won stages whilst </span><b>Jonas Vingegaard</b><span> is posing a strong podium challenge. Even if Vingegaard is strong enough to win the stage, he doesn’t have the team at his disposal to control the breakaway. Their best tactic may be to send the likes of Kuss and Van Aert into the break, where Van Aert can chase the polka-dot jersey and Kuss can be used as a satellite rider, dropping back late in the stage to assist Vingegaard.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Ineos Grenadiers must remain aggressive to chase a stage victory. Although </span><b>Richard Carapaz</b><span> is challenging for a podium, the British outfit would have hoped for more prior to departing Brest. Nonetheless, they still have a strong squad with only Luke Rowe abandoning to this point. They may choose to use the likes of </span><b>Richie Porte, Geraint Thomas </b><span>and </span><b>Michal Kwiatkowski </b><span>to up the tempo in the peloton to blow things up. Alternatively, they could cram the breakaway with as many riders as possible, where they could be of benefit to Carapaz after he attacks rather than before. And knowing Richard Carapaz, he <em>will</em> attack at some point.</span></p>\n<p><span>Although he is just 26, </span><b>Enric Mas</b><span> already has three top 5 finishes at Grand Tours to his name. On those three ocassions, he has never lost a GC place </span><span>in the final week, which is where he is able to show his strength. Due to Mas’ strong record over three weeks, he can never be written off by his rivals until the race is over. Keep an eye on Movistar, who boast premier teammates in </span><b>Alejandro Valverde</b><span> and </span><strong>Miguel Ángel López</strong><span> to support Mas, who won't simply settle for a spot in the top 10.</span></p>\n<p><span>The other GC riders to keep an eye on are </span><b>Wilco Kelderman, Ben O’Connor </b><span>and </span><b>Rigoberto </b><b>Urán</b><b>.</b></p>\n<p><span>With so many king of the mountains points available and at least four riders in with a chance of winning the jersey, the battle for the breakaway will be fierce. The holder of the polka-dot jersey </span><b>Wout Poels </b><span>will be challenged by</span><b> Mike Woods, Nairo Quintana </b><span>and </span><b>Wout van Aert. </b><span>By virtue of joining the breakaway, all four riders would also have a chance at winning the stage too. </span></p>\n<p><span>Other riders with a chance from the breakaway group include </span><b>Ion Izagirre, Sergio Higuita, David Gaudu </b><span>and </span><b>Esteban Chaves.</b></p>\n<p><i><span>Cover image: A.S.O./Pauline Ballet</span></i></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"49e512d4ac504e03f7cd139d130c0372605dad194d63652aa8cd837acf281a0c","category":"Cycling"}
