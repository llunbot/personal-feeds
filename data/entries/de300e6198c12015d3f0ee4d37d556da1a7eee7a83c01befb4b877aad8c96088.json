As the Asahi team explains, “if the display (on the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro) is configured to a refresh rate other than ProMotion, that system will no longer be able to boot into older macOS.” Asahi Linux does not support ProMotion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The developers say this includes recovery mode when those systems are set as the default boot OS, and also System Recovery at least until the next subsequent OS upgrade. The team says users will not lose any data as a result of this bug but will need another Mac to recover from the fault using Device Firmware Upgrade mode. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, this is an issue unlikely to affect many MacBook users, as nearly all of them likely use the ProMotion preset, but if you regularly keep your refresh rate at 60Hz or below, make sure it’s set to ProMotion when upgrading to the newest version of Sonoma.</p>\n\nMacOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"de300e6198c12015d3f0ee4d37d556da1a7eee7a83c01befb4b877aad8c96088","category":"Apple"}
