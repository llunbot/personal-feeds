Fantastical isn’t just the best calendaring app for iOS and Mac; Cardhop isn’t just the best contacts app for iOS and Mac — these are two of the best apps in the world today, period.</p>\n\n<p>And, lo, Fantastical is no longer just for Mac, iPhone, and iPad. From Apple’s Newsroom announcement about Vision Pro pre-orders and availability today:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An infinite canvas for productivity: With key productivity and \ncollaboration apps like Fantastical, Freeform, JigSpace, apps from \nMicrosoft 365, and Slack, Apple Vision Pro is an ideal \nproductivity tool for everyday tasks. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I believe this means that Fantastical is the first third-party VisionOS app Apple has ever mentioned. Can’t wait to see it.</p>\n\n<p>2023 was a huge year for Flexibits, and they have <a href=\"https://flexibits.com/blog/2023/12/the-flexibits-2023-year-in-review/\">a terrific year-in-review blog post</a> that runs down all the details. But the highlights are obvious: excellent support for widgets (on all platforms, including interactive widgets on the latest OSes) and Live Activities on iOS. They also added several improvements to their Openings feature that lets people find meeting times that work for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>Flexibits has a killer offer for DF readers: <a href=\"https://flexibits.com/df2024\">20 percent off for up to two full years</a>, both for new <em>and</em> current Flexibits subscribers. I just used the code to renew my own annual subscription. Even if your subscription isn’t due for renewal yet, you can apply the code now. But act fast — the deal is only good through the end of day Tuesday.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/08/fantastical\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4442cb655989b0802cc800790059ec9a4445dd4a22483ad9cec64db850901c2f","category":"Tech"}
