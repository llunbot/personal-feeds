The exceptions are those with aggressive, Windows-based anti-cheating tools baked in, something that hit back hard against players eager to dive into a new superhero shooter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marvelrivals.com/\"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>, an <em>Overwatch</em>-ish free-to-play hero shooter released in early December 2024, has all the typical big online game elements: an in-game shop with skins and customizations, battle passes, and anti-cheating tech. While Proton, which powers the Linux-based Steam Deck's ability to play just about any Windows game, has come very far in a few years' time, its biggest blind spots are these kinds of online-only games, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/gta-online-is-broken-on-steam-deck-following-anti-cheat-update/\">like <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em></a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/why-the-steam-deck-might-be-too-open-for-fortnite-and-destiny-2/\"><em>Fortnite</em></a>, <em>Destiny 2, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/why-the-steam-deck-might-be-too-open-for-fortnite-and-destiny-2/\">Apex Legends</a>, </em>and the like. The same goes for Mac players, who, if they can work past DirectX 12, can often get a Windows game working in CrossOver or Parallels, minus any anti-cheat tools.</p>\n<p>Is there harm in trying? For a while, there was 100 years' worth. As <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/1hrsitf/marvel_rivals_banning_mac_os_users/\">detailed in the r/macgaming subreddit</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1hs39mf/can_proton_cause_you_to_get_flagged_for_cheating/\">at r/SteamDeck</a>, many players who successfully got <em>Marvel Rivals</em> working would receive a \"Penalty Issued\" notice, with a violation \"detected\" and bans <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hs2s6z/ban_until_2124_for_cheating_but_i_didnt_cheat/\">issued until 2124</a>. Should such a ban stand, players risked entirely missing the much-prophesied Year of the Linux Desktop or Mainstream Mac Gaming, almost certain to happen at some point in that span.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/marvel-rivals-lifts-100-year-cheating-bans-on-mac-and-steam-deck-players/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/marvel-rivals-lifts-100-year-cheating-bans-on-mac-and-steam-deck-players/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"20ed63ff7cc59033a018caf5555a4d67fbed9a21a701cef9dd5861b2b97cefbd","category":"Tech"}
