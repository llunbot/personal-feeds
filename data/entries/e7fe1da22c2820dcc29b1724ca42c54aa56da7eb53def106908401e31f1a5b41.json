Now, it is available for an even lower $649 heading into\nthe back-to-school shopping season. It is unclear how long the\ndeal will last.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The M1 MacBook Air will turn 4 years old in November, but it remains an excellent laptop, including support for the upcoming Apple Intelligence features in MacOS 15 Sequoia. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/15/macbook-air-walmart\">As I wrote in March, when this partnership started</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And while, yes, these machines are now over three years old,\nfor $700 this is a great deal. That’s 30 percent less than the\ncheapest MacBook in an Apple Store. I’d bet serious money that\na base M1 MacBook Air outperforms any other $700 laptop on the\nmarket. Show me another $700 laptop with a retina display.\nI’ll wait.</p>\n\n<p>Fascinating example of pricing-as-branding that Apple won’t sell\nthis machine in its own stores, but will through Walmart — which\ndoesn’t sell any other Macs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/10/m1-macbook-air-walmart-650\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e7fe1da22c2820dcc29b1724ca42c54aa56da7eb53def106908401e31f1a5b41","category":"Tech"}
