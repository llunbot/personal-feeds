In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5mJB1dgyKs&amp;t=2s\">new Digital Foundry video</a>, it was discovered that a performance bump—which affects both the console's 1000 series launch model and recently released 1100 series model revision—appears to make certain games run up to three percentage points faster.</p>\n<p>Digital Foundry founder Richard Leadbetter compared performance tests in <em>Control Ultimate Edition</em> and <em>Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition</em> using previously released PS5 firmware as a benchmark against the now-current September system software update. The video's accompanying frame-graph footage showed <em>DMC5SE</em> cut scenes and <em>Control</em>'s photo mode (which unlocks the game's frame rate, capped at 30 fps during gameplay) running at a fluctuating 1-2 frames per second higher on the PS5 using the newer firmware.</p>\n<p>During his tests, Leadbetter said each game was running 1-3 percent faster with a 1 percent margin of error. He added that ray tracing and unlocked frame rates seemed to be a \"common component\" in their occurrence. Digital Foundry did not mention any other games that have unlocked frame rates below 60 fps, since the powerful PS5 console doesn't have many of those. This leaves to interpretation exactly how much power this firmware update is possibly opening up to PS5 games across the board.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796836#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796836&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Steve Haske","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d96aeb2ff2b0713cf39f5212720bedc2f581138e1257a5fbe161cfd30416ac63","category":"Tech"}
