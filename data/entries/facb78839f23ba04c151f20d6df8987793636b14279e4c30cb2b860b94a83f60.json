{"title":"GoPro Hero 12 Black vs Apple iPhone 15: Action Test!","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/09/gopro-vs-iphone-camera.html","date":1695587145000,"content":"<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p>For those not subscribed on YouTube, just a quick heads up that I dropped the above video today, which is a comparison between two totally different cameras, yet ones that also have significant overlap. And in this case, focusing heavily on Apple’s “action mode”, which is in all editions of the iPhone 15. This mode significantly stabilizes the image, while concurrently cropping in a bit.</p>\n<p>Like last year, I went side-by-side with a slate of different scenarios, including but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All-out running sprint tests with my wife</li>\n<li>Cannonball slow-mo testing</li>\n<li>Chasing cyclists on a dark rainy night in Amsterdam</li>\n<li>Trying to put the iPhone atop a very small drone</li>\n<li>Mountain biking</li>\n<li>Road cycling</li>\n<li>…and a bunch more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Give it a play, up above, I’m reasonably sure you’ll probably find it entertaining – as well as informative. It’s been interesting to see the responses on YouTube in the comments section, with people split on which camera is the ‘winner’ in various scenarios.</p>\n<p>Thanks for watching!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","author":"DC Rainmaker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"facb78839f23ba04c151f20d6df8987793636b14279e4c30cb2b860b94a83f60","category":"Cycling"}
