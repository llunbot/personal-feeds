Tapping on the thumbs up/down icon brings up a secondary interface for providing thumbs up and thumbs down ratings for various categories like products, customer service, food, atmosphere, and more, based on the location being reviewed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUsers also have the option to upload photos of the location to the ‌Apple Maps‌ app to be added to the maps listing.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/apple-maps-ratings-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the current time, the ‌Apple Maps‌ native rating system is displayed alongside the Yelp ratings that are provided for various locations. Apple may eventually be planning to replace Yelp and TripAdvisor integrations, but will need to build up a database of ratings before that will be possible.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere are no options for written reviews at this time, however, so it is not clear if Apple plans to entirely replace Yelp.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNative rating options in the ‌Apple Maps‌ app appear to be new for users in the United States, but Apple has been testing the feature in other countries like the UK and Australia for some time now. Ratings may also be available in additional countries based on the Ratings and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> Terms <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/maps/ratings-photos/ww/\">legal site for Maps</a> that was <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/pa6j6u/initial_phase_of_native_reviews_now_built_into/\">shared on Reddit</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/\">Apple Maps</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/23/apple-maps-native-review-feature-us-users/\">Apple Expands Native Maps Rating and Review Feature to the U.S.</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expands-native-maps-rating-and-review-feature-to-the-u-s.2308444/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nnnff2wGazM:Ig9oSbQ92QI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nnnff2wGazM:Ig9oSbQ92QI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/nnnff2wGazM\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"731309b1c4794b57cfae37dec2795414c4f37630eb9c02a85f573df7b5ee66b5","category":"Apple"}
