But life becomes easier if you understand where unsuccessful businesses most often go wrong. Whether you’re the owner of a major SMB, an up-and-coming entrepreneur, or a keen side hustler, there are four aspects of your business it’s vital to get right.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Communication:</strong> You must keep everyone on the same page. A disjointed team cannot work effectively to achieve the business’s goals.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Even before lockdown this was often a concern. But with remote working practices becoming more and more common it’s more vital than ever that you are able to coordinate across teams, and share files efficiently as and when they are needed. Silos are to be avoided.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Professionalism: </strong>Regardless of the size of your organisation, a professional image is crucial. Contacting clients and partners using a personal email address is one all-too-common way to undermine credibility and confidence.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Workflow efficiency:</strong> If your employees are wasting time on manual tasks, or getting bogged down juggling multiple inefficient software tools, this cuts into the time they can spend focusing on core business activities. They’re likely to become demotivated and bored, too.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>All too many businesses fall down in one or more of these vital areas. But you can avoid their fate by selecting the right business software solution.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Workspace-hero1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Google Workspace hero 1\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Workspace-hero1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2124w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Workspace-hero1.jpg?resize=300%2C141&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Workspace-hero1.jpg?resize=768%2C362&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Workspace-hero1.jpg?resize=1200%2C565&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Workspace-hero1.jpg?resize=1536%2C723&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Workspace-hero1.jpg?resize=2048%2C964&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"565\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Google Workspace hero 1\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Workspace-hero1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2124w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Workspace-hero1.jpg?resize=300%2C141&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Workspace-hero1.jpg?resize=768%2C362&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Workspace-hero1.jpg?resize=1200%2C565&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Workspace-hero1.jpg?resize=1536%2C723&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Workspace-hero1.jpg?resize=2048%2C964&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"565\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Google</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Google Workspace hero 1\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Workspace-hero1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2124w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Workspace-hero1.jpg?resize=300%2C141&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Workspace-hero1.jpg?resize=768%2C362&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Workspace-hero1.jpg?resize=1200%2C565&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Workspace-hero1.jpg?resize=1536%2C723&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Workspace-hero1.jpg?resize=2048%2C964&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"565\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Google</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Google</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>And here’s how we think Google Workspace can help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://workspace.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Workspace</a> is an all-in-one business software solution that’s perfect for SMBs, entrepreneurs and side hustlers.
