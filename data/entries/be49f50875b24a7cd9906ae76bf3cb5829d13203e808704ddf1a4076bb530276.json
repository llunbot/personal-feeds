The lawsuit seeks \"at least $1.76 billion that was fraudulently transferred to Binance and its executives at the FTX creditors' expense, as well as compensatory and punitive damages to be determined at trial.\"</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.deb.194820/gov.uscourts.deb.194820.1.0_1.pdf\">complaint</a> filed yesterday in US Bankruptcy Court in Delaware names Binance and co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao among the defendants. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried sold 20 percent of his crypto exchange to Binance in November 2019, but Binance exited that investment in 2021, the lawsuit said.</p>\n<p>\"As Zhao would later remark, he decided to exit his position in FTX because of personal grievances he had against Bankman-Fried,\" the lawsuit said. \"In July 2021, the parties negotiated a deal whereby FTX bought back Binance's and its executives' entire stakes in both FTX Trading and [parent company] WRS. Pursuant to that deal, FTX's Alameda Research division directly funded the share repurchase with a combination of FTT (FTX's exchange token), BNB (Binance's exchange token), and BUSD (Binance's dollar-pegged stablecoin). In the aggregate, those tokens had a fair market value of at least $1.76 billion.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/ftx-sues-binance-for-1-76b-in-battle-of-crypto-exchanges-founded-by-convicts/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/ftx-sues-binance-for-1-76b-in-battle-of-crypto-exchanges-founded-by-convicts/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"be49f50875b24a7cd9906ae76bf3cb5829d13203e808704ddf1a4076bb530276","category":"Tech"}
