However, fast-charging the 16-inch MacBook Pro requires a 140W port and cable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Baseus desktop charger has this covered with one of the two spare USB-C ports rated at 140W PD 3.1. The other port matches the built-in cable at 100W PD 3.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside these USB-C connections is a USB-A port that is rated at a respectable 15W for charging older devices that still use the non-reversible rectangular connection. 15W is more than enough to charge your AirPods case, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 2.6 feet (0.8m) the cable is long enough to reach across most desks, and retracts back into the charger body with a slight pull. The connector end then magnetically tidies itself to the front panel of the charger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most unique of the features is the magnetic wireless charging pad that unfolds from the top of the desktop charger. This is built for iPhones (12 and later) and can charge wirelessly at 15W as it uses the MagSafe-friendly Qi2 technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The maximum power output is 140W so if fast-charging a 16-inch MacBook, you won’t be able to use any of the other ports without reducing power. Other desktop chargers such as the <a href=\"https://www.anker.com/products/a2683-anker-prime-charger-200w-6-ports-gan?variant=43856909074582\">Anker Prime Charger</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BXBQL713\">Satechi 200W USB-C 6-port PD GaN Charger</a> both have a higher 200W total output, but lack the handy built-in cable and wireless charger.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Baseus-Nomos-Qi2-5-in-1-Desktop-Charger_wireless.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Baseus Nomos Qi2 5 in 1 Desktop Charger wireless\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Baseus-Nomos-Qi2-5-in-1-Desktop-Charger_wireless.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Baseus-Nomos-Qi2-5-in-1-Desktop-Charger_wireless.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Baseus-Nomos-Qi2-5-in-1-Desktop-Charger_wireless.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Baseus-Nomos-Qi2-5-in-1-Desktop-Charger_wireless.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Baseus-Nomos-Qi2-5-in-1-Desktop-Charger_wireless.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Baseus-Nomos-Qi2-5-in-1-Desktop-Charger_wireless.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Baseus-Nomos-Qi2-5-in-1-Desktop-Charger_wireless.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The good-looking and compact Baseus Nomos 5-in-1 Charger is a little below the average size for a desktop charger, measuring 4.7 x 3.5 x 1.6 inches (11.9 x 8.9 x 4.1cm). It weighs just over a pound and under half a kilo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While desktop chargers, as their name suggests, are usually static, the Nomos could be picked up and carried in a bag as its power cord goes straight to a power socket (with no unwieldy power brick) and is detachable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wireless phone charging pad can be pulled up about 0.6 inches and angled at up to 60 degrees if used as a phone stand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next to the Qi2 pad is a smart display that shows a detailed charging status for each output.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Baseus-Nomos-5-in-1-Desktop-Charger-Qi2-140W-desktop.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Baseus Nomos 5-in-1 Desktop Charger Qi2 140W desktop\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Baseus-Nomos-5-in-1-Desktop-Charger-Qi2-140W-desktop.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Baseus-Nomos-5-in-1-Desktop-Charger-Qi2-140W-desktop.jpg?resize=300%2C260&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Baseus-Nomos-5-in-1-Desktop-Charger-Qi2-140W-desktop.jpg?resize=768%2C666&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Baseus-Nomos-5-in-1-Desktop-Charger-Qi2-140W-desktop.jpg?resize=1200%2C1041&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Baseus-Nomos-5-in-1-Desktop-Charger-Qi2-140W-desktop.jpg?resize=1536%2C1332&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1041\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Baseus</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Baseus 5-in-1 Nomos Charger is priced at $149.99 / €149,99, either <a href=\"https://www.baseus.com/products/nomos-5-in-1-desktop-charger-qi2-140w\">direct</a> or at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Charging-Certified-Magnetic-Retractable/dp/B0DHV7LR12/\">Amazon</a>.
