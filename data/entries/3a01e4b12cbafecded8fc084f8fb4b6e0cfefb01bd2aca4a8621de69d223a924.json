Justin Timberlake is scheduled to play the \narena in May. Even Apple’s much-watched launch events for the \niPhone and iPad didn’t fill a venue this large. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apple never tried to fill a venue that large for a keynote (the big keynotes at Macworld Expo and WWDC, in Moscone West and the San Jose Convention Center, were capped at about 4,000 to 5,000), but surely could have. But the point stands: Nvidia has the world’s attention, and deservedly so.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/19/nvidia-keynote\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3a01e4b12cbafecded8fc084f8fb4b6e0cfefb01bd2aca4a8621de69d223a924","category":"Tech"}
