The update is available for all machines running macOS Sonoma.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s uncommon for Apple to release an update so soon after the last one, especially one with no known issues addressed. Apple’s release notes merely state that the update contains “important bug fixes and security updates and is recommended for all users.” According to Apple’s security releases site, macOS 14.2.1 contains a single security release that is not known to have been exploited in the wild:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WindowServer</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impact: </strong>A user who shares their screen may unintentionally share the incorrect content</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Description: </strong>A session rendering issue was addressed with improved session tracking.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CVE-2023-42940: </strong>Craig Hockenberry</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Apple has released Safari 17.2.1 for macOS Monterey and Ventura, though that doesn’t include any security fixes, per Apple’s release notes. Like macOS 14.2.1 it’s unknown what that update fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To update to macOS 14.2.1, head over to <em>System Settings</em>, then click <em>General</em> and <em>Software Update</em>.</p>\n\nMacOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"18477f1165dab3086a2256ebe3876f3c2bd626b90c840f299162618dff070548","category":"Apple"}
