Folding flat in mere seconds, it allows you to stow it in your vehicle or in your shop at home taking up minimal space. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-tilted-to-make-it-stable.jpeg\"><img width=\"620\" height=\"464\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-tilted-to-make-it-stable.jpeg\" alt=\"Rimpact The Stand tilted to make it stable\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-tilted-to-make-it-stable.jpeg 620w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-tilted-to-make-it-stable-297x222.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-tilted-to-make-it-stable-120x90.jpeg 120w\" /></a><figcaption>The Stand’s slight angles help with stability.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Contacting the ground in three distinct ways, The Stand looks stable enough to wrench on your steed wherever you may be. Its unique design gives it a slight lean at the base and the mounting axis is tilted slightly in the opposite direction. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-on-nondrive-side.jpeg\"><img width=\"291\" height=\"194\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-on-nondrive-side.jpeg\" alt=\"Rimpact The Stand on nondrive side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-on-nondrive-side.jpeg 291w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-on-nondrive-side-120x80.jpeg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-non-drive-sisde-as-well.jpeg\"><img width=\"291\" height=\"194\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-non-drive-sisde-as-well.jpeg\" alt=\"Rimpact The Stand non-drive side as well\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-non-drive-sisde-as-well.jpeg 291w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-non-drive-sisde-as-well-120x80.jpeg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stand holds the bike by the center of the crank, lifting only the rear wheel, allowing you to still spin the cranks for adjustments and lube your chain. It goes into your crank arms so you can do a pre-ride prep or post-ride cleaning. The Stand can be used on bikes with either Shimano or SRAM cranks with a hollow spindle (not suitable for eBikes). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-arms-deployed.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-arms-deployed-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Rimpact The Stand arms deployed\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-arms-deployed-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-arms-deployed-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-arms-deployed-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-arms-deployed-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-arms-deployed-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-arms-deployed.jpeg 827w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-arms-folded-up.jpeg\"><img width=\"367\" height=\"551\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-arms-folded-up.jpeg\" alt=\"Rimpact The Stand arms folded up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-arms-folded-up.jpeg 367w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-arms-folded-up-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-arms-folded-up-80x120.jpeg 80w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Each stand is handmade in the UK by designed Dan Hicks and made of 6082 Aluminum and 304 Stainless Steel. They use roller bearings in the head with IGUS Polymer bushings in the folding arms. These features will make for a strong, durable, and corrosion-resistant work stand. The bearings at the head set it apart from other similar BB-mount stands and is what lets the cranks spin freely enough to make adjustments. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-using-it-on-drive-side-e1681226378613.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"417\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-using-it-on-drive-side-e1681226378613-800x417.jpeg\" alt=\"Rimpact The Stand using it on drive side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-using-it-on-drive-side-e1681226378613-800x417.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-using-it-on-drive-side-e1681226378613-297x155.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-using-it-on-drive-side-e1681226378613-120x63.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-using-it-on-drive-side-e1681226378613-768x401.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rimpact-The-Stand-using-it-on-drive-side-e1681226378613.jpeg 803w\" /></a><figcaption>Mounted drive side</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Stand Retail &amp; Compatibility</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stand retails for $93 USD </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes with your choice of crank adaptor size, either 20mm (Shimano Hollow Tech ll) or 18mm (SRAM Cranks, Raceface Turbines &amp; and Shimano (but less stable).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Cranks that have any kind of cap or closed bolt on the crank spindle, are not compatible. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are unsure, Rimpact says to measure the internal diameter of your crank spindle as well as the depth, you’ll need at least 18mm ID and a depth of 80mm.
