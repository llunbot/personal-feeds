In the last 10 years, scientists have heatedly debated whether these unusual patterns are due to sand termites or to an ecological version of a self-organizing Turing mechanism. Last year, a team of scientists reported what they deemed definitive evidence of the latter, thus ruling out sand termites, but their declaration of victory may have been premature. A <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S143383192300029X?via%3Dihub\">recent paper</a> published in the journal Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics offers a careful rebuttal of those 2022 findings, concluding that sand termites may be to blame after all.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/its-not-termites-new-study-gives-fresh-take-on-how-fairy-circles-form/\">we've reported</a> previously, the fairy circles can be as large as several feet in diameter. Dubbed \"footprints of the gods,\" it's often said they are the work of the Himba deity <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukuru\">Mukuru</a>, or an underground dragon whose poisonous breath kills anything growing inside those circles. Scientists have their own ideas. </p>\n<p>One theory—espoused by study co-author Norbert Jürgens, a biologist at the University of Hamburg in Germany—attributed the phenomenon to a particular <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/by-building-fairy-circles-termites-engineer-their-own-ecosystem/\">species of termite</a> (<em>Psammmotermes allocerus</em>), whose burrowing damages plant roots, resulting in extra rainwater seeping into the sandy soil before the plants can suck it up—giving the termites a handy water trap as a resource. As a result, the plants die back in a circle from the site of an insect nest. The circles expand in diameter during droughts because the termites must venture farther out for food.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955177#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955177&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b977f19c2a1354f31759e5bc3a46e00a4a39ac39731331acd979f54a1dece833","category":"Tech"}
