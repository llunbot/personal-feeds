Microsoft allows advertisers to manage their campaigns, create posts, and view engagement data on multiple social sites via one centralized interface, and they'll still be able to do so for posts on Facebook, Instagram Business, and LinkedIn. But Twitter is no longer on that list.</p>\n<p>The change comes a few days before Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1641222786894135296\">plans to deprecate the old API tiers</a> that allowed third-party apps and services to post to Twitter and access its data. The new Enterprise tier, which Microsoft would need to use to continue providing the same level of service to advertisers as before, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-data-api-prices-out-nearly-everyone/\">can cost between $42,000 and $210,000 a month</a>, depending on how many tweets per month you need to be able to access.</p>\n\n<p>Twitter CEO Elon Musk apparently isn't happy about Microsoft's decision. Responding to a post about the news, Musk asserted that Microsoft has \"illegally\" used Twitter data to train AI models and that he plans to take legal action.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933253#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933253&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"130bf544e8bae102d06f0d612714f8f9eaba26cefa88acc2f1a935ed02747333","category":"Tech"}
