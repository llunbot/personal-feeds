Here's what was removed:<blockquote>The highly detailed and academic Sketch style produces gorgeous drawings on stark backgrounds.</blockquote>The updated app description only mentions animation and Illustration.<blockquote>Animation style offers a whimsical, 3D cartoon look with expressive characters and cinematic environments. Illustration style is defined by strong outlines, simple shapes, and bold colors, providing uplifting and playful compositions.</blockquote>While Apple updated the Style portion of the ‌Image Playground‌ app description, one mistaken mention of three style options remains at the top. \"‌Image Playground‌, powered by ‌Apple Intelligence‌, lets you turn descriptions, concepts or people from your photo library into original, fun images in three unique styles.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSketch is also still listed as an option <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/\">on Apple's website</a> highlighting ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features, but Apple will likely remove these remaining references soon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt isn't clear why Apple decided to eliminate the sketch option from ‌Image Playground‌, or if sketch or other styles will be added in the future. As it stands, ‌Image Playground‌ in iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.2 will only include animation and illustration as style options. The updates are set to launch in early December.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(<a href=\"https://x.com/nicolas09f9\">Thanks, Nicolás</a>!)</em><div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/07/apple-removes-sketch-from-image-playground/\">Apple Drops Promised 'Sketch' Style Option From Image Playground</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-drops-promised-sketch-style-option-from-image-playground.2442286/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9696f52d9f73162293762df15988960e5006fe13620ab5c253dfbc790cd3c4a7","category":"Apple"}
