Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Spain, and Andorra will be the first to get access from October 26. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/04/hbomax1.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nNext year, the another wave of territories will be added to that list: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAdditional territory launches are also planned for next year, but there are currently no plans to launch HBO Max in the France, Italy, Germany, and the U.K. This is said to be partly due to WarnerMedia having deals in place with other partners in these countries, where HBO programming is available on services such as Sky Atlantic and Now TV.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHBO Max was officially launched in the U.S. in May 2020, and has since expanded to 39 territories in Latin America and the Caribbean. Like those regions, the above European countries will gain access to content from HBO, Warner Bros., DC, and Cartoon Network.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>\"This is a historic moment as HBO Max lands in Europe,\" said Johannes Larcher, Head of HBO Max International. \"WarnerMedia movies and series like Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and The Big Bang Theory are passionately consumed by fans all across Europe, and HBO Max has been created to provide them with the most intuitive and convenient viewing experience to watch these and a diverse range of other amazing titles.\"</blockquote>HBO has yet to say what the cost of the streaming service will be in Europe, but it will make that announcement in a virtual launch scheduled for October.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/hbo-max/\">HBO Max</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/09/hbo-max-launching-europe-october/\">HBO Max Coming to Six European Countries in October</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hbo-max-coming-to-six-european-countries-in-october.2310141/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=uzkI-0cPQtA:qRZknQ_GtYg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=uzkI-0cPQtA:qRZknQ_GtYg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/uzkI-0cPQtA\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a625375a4cca415a799067aec9f7da0adf505c68d920ee9dff56e68b1ee16862","category":"Apple"}
