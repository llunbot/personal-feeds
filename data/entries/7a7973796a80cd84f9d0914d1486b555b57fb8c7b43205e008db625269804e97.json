It's humbling that, after 26 years, so many people still care so much about making Ars into the best possible version of itself.</p>\n<p>Based on your feedback, we've just pushed a new update to the site that we hope fixes many readers' top concerns. (You might need to hard-refresh to see it.)</p>\n<p>Much of the feedback (forum posts, email, DMs, the Ars comment form) has told us that the chief goals of the redesign—more layout options, larger text, better readability—were successful. But readers have also offered up interesting edge cases and different use patterns for which design changes would be useful. Though we can't please everyone, we will continue to make iterative design tweaks so that the site can work well for as many people as possible.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/10/ars-9-0-1-redesign-is-now-live-with-density-tweaks-and-visited-link-colors/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/10/ars-9-0-1-redesign-is-now-live-with-density-tweaks-and-visited-link-colors/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ken Fisher","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7a7973796a80cd84f9d0914d1486b555b57fb8c7b43205e008db625269804e97","category":"Tech"}
