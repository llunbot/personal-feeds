{"title":"Apple Decides Not to Bring Back In-Person 'Today at Apple' Classes on August 30","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/today-at-apple-in-person-classes-canceled/","date":1629218900000,"content":"Just yesterday, Apple told its retail staff in the United States and Europe that it would start bringing back some in-person Today at Apple classes starting on August 30, but now Apple has reversed course.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/today-at-apple.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn-person Today at Apple sessions will no longer be resuming at this time, with Apple putting in-person classes off because of the ongoing rise of the Delta variant across the United States and other countries.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple yesterday was taking reservations for in-person classes at some store locations, but as of now, all of those in-person reservations are gone and Apple is only offering virtual sessions.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-retail/\">Apple retail</a> stores have been open since earlier this year and there are no plans to close stores again, but Apple recently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/28/apple-retail-stores-mask-requirement/\">reinstated a mask mandate</a> that requires customers visiting most retail stores in the United States to wear a mask. Apple had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/13/apple-stores-dropping-mask-requirement/\">dropped mask mandates</a> for vaccinated customers in June, but brought them back in areas heavily impacted by the Delta variant of COVID-19.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to pushing back Today at Apple classes, Apple is also ramping up COVID testing of both retail and corporate employees, reports <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-17/apple-to-increase-covid-testing-of-staff-in-face-of-delta-spread\">Bloomberg</a></em>. Employees who participate in Apple's at-home testing program will now receive testing kits twice per week instead of once per week.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\"With the emergence of more contagious variants like delta, we believe that more frequent testing will better protect you and everyone at Apple,\" reads a memo to employees. \"Beginning Aug. 16, Quest will be sending you two mail-in test kits per week instead of one.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple later plans to expand testing to three times per week for employees in some offices, but there is no mandate for testing or vaccinations. Apple originally planned to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/02/apple-employees-returning-to-work/\">bring back corporate employees</a> in September, and later <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/apple-delays-return-to-offices/\">pushed that back</a> until at least October.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-retail-stores/\">Apple Stores</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-retail/\">Apple retail</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-basics-help-and-buying-advice.78\">Mac Basics, Help and Buying Advice</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/today-at-apple-in-person-classes-canceled/\">Apple Decides Not to Bring Back In-Person 'Today at Apple' Classes on August 30</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-decides-not-to-bring-back-in-person-today-at-apple-classes-on-august-30.2307826/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=aXIzwq_LDnc:9ag-QM6c_PY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=aXIzwq_LDnc:9ag-QM6c_PY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/aXIzwq_LDnc\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b819161f8e93e8c3bf418884b5b0e26a71497fe7f15e1e44ddbc40f0448b36e4","category":"Apple"}
