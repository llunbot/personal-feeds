However, it feels more powerful than this, with a removable 316.8Wh battery that gave us 35 miles of range.</p>\n<p>The bike has 650b wheels, which make for easy low-speed handling, while the long wheelbase adds stability.

In fact, there are many more cargo bike options available with a motor than without.</p>\n<p>The frequent starts and stops for traffic in urban settings and on delivery runs make getting a cargo bike – whether assisted or non-assisted – moving from a standstill harder than a steady run.</p>\n<p>Likewise, any hills you encounter on your ride will be a lot easier with electrical assistance.</p>\n<p>But the motor and battery add yet more weight to an electric bike over a non-assisted bike.</p>\n<p>Any cargo bike tends to be heavy, due to the extended wheelbase (which means more frame material), substantially built carry area, and chunky wheels and tyres. The frame is often made of steel too.</p>\n<p>Even the lightest cargo bikes start off at over 20kg; 30kg is more typical, even before you add extras such as seats or a box. In contrast, a normal bike is likely to weigh well under 20kg, even if it’s built heavily.</p>\n<p>A typical electric cargo bike motor will add just under 3kg, while you can expect even a low-capacity battery to double that. A high-capacity battery can weigh over 4kg, so a double-battery configuration could add over 11kg to the cargo bike’s weight.</p>\n<p>Riese &amp; Müller’s electric cargo bikes weigh around 35kg and the electric Cube Cargo Hybrid can weigh close to 50kg, for example.</p>\n<p>Electric cargo bikes are built tough, however, and you can expect to be able to carry a load of over 200kg (including the rider) on many models. That’s a lot of mass to get moving, and the motor and battery – even with their additional weight over a non-assisted cargo bike – are definitely an asset.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bosch motor on an electric cargo bike\" title=\"Bosch motor on an electric cargo bike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Motor systems for electric bikes can be expensive.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Electric bikes are also, generally speaking, quite expensive.</p>\n<p>A quality electric bike motor system is likely to increase the price of an electric cargo bike by around £1,000 over a pedal-only cargo bike.</p>\n<p>You can expect higher maintenance costs for an electric bike over a normal bike too, due to the extra wear on the drivetrain, the possibility of electrical issues and the impact of the extra weight on tyres, wheels and brakes.</p>\n<p>With a heavy frame and often sporting small wheels with chunky tyres on a long wheelbase, don’t expect a fast or lively ride from a cargo bike, whether electric or not.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, an electric cargo bike can be surprisingly agile and will enable you to zip around stationary traffic and through bike-only shortcuts to get to your destination faster.</p>\n<h3>What about battery range?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Battery on the main frame of an electric cargo bike\" title=\"Rad Power RadWagon 08\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A high-capacity battery, and possibly a spare, is needed for intensive use.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley</i></span></div>\n<p>If an electric cargo bike is going to be used extensively, it’s possible the battery won’t have enough capacity to last an entire day.</p>\n<p>This means you’ll either need to swap in a spare battery, recharge during the work day (which can take several hours), or suffer through the arduous task of pedalling without assistance.</p>\n<p>The stop-start nature of urban riding means the battery is likely to be drained more quickly as well.</p>\n<h3>Types of electric cargo bike</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rad Power RadWagon\" title=\"Rad Power RadWagon\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Longer wheelbases up carrying capacity.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Electric cargo bikes typically have an extended wheelbase over a conventional bike. That allows the inclusion of a cargo-carrying area either fore or aft of the rider.</p>\n<p>Often, cargo bikes will have smaller wheels than a standard bike, or different-sized wheels front and rear, so the load can be carried lower on the frame and the centre of gravity of the bike is lower.</p>\n<p>Both of these design features improve handling compared to strapping a load to a conventional bike.</p>\n<p>Many cargo bikes enable you to add different load carriers to suit different uses.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cube Cargo Hybrid ebike\" title=\"Cube Cargo Hybrid\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Cube Cargo Hybrid’s hopper can be fitted with seats to transport children.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Cube Bikes</i></span></div>\n<p>Cube’s Cargo Hybrid, for example, enables you to fit seats inside its front hopper so you can carry children. The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/mycle-cargo-review/\">Mycle Cargo</a> comes with footrests and removable pads for its rear rack, so you can carry passengers. You can also fit child seats to it.</p>\n<p>Cargo bikes with a built-in box often go by the Dutch name bakfiets (which translates as ‘box bike’). It’s a popular way to carry goods and luggage, but also enables you to fit seats for children for the school run and other excursions. <a href=\"https://www.bakfiets.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bakfiets</a> is a brand name for a Dutch maker of cargo bikes as well.</p>\n<p>Other electric cargo bike designs, such as the Surly Skid Loader, include a beefed-up front and/or rear rack on a more conventional, shorter-wheelbase bike frame.</p>\n<p>That has the advantage of manoeuvrability, but may limit how much you can carry. They’re generally less stable too, because a poorly distributed rear load may tend to shift the bike’s centre of mass behind the rear-wheel axis and a large front-end load can affect steering.</p>\n<h4>Electric cargo tricycles</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Father cycling with daughters on an electric cargo bicycle\" title=\"Father cycling with daughters on an electric cargo bicycle\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Three wheels make for greater stability when riding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Solskin / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>Not all electric cargo bikes are technically bikes, because <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/adult-tricycles/\">tricycles</a> are available as well.</p>\n<p>The configuration usually includes two wheels at the front, as with the Raleigh Pro Electric Cargo Trike.

If the bike doesn’t come ready-equipped to carry cargo, the brand may sell purpose-made boxes or open baskets.</p>\n<p>You may be able to buy seats for transporting children or adults, rain covers and lockable tops. Some electric cargo bikes have been designed to accept standard accessories such as child seats. We mentioned fitting a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-trailer/\">bike trailer</a> above.</p>\n<p>Many electric cargo bikes come ready-fitted with other useful accessories such as a kickstand, which needs to be extra-robust to handle the weight of the bike and its load.

Most are substantially larger than a standard bike, so you need extra room, particularly if you have boxes attached for load-lugging.</p>\n<p>The Tern Quick Haul is designed so you can stand it on its rear rack when not in use, but you may need a dedicated storage area such as a garage to store an electric cargo bike.</p>\n<p>Where you store the bike needs to be on the flat too – you’re not going to want to lug a 30kg electric bike up stairs. Walk mode can make off-bike manoeuvring easier.</p>\n<p>You may also need an electric power output close to where you keep your electric bike. Many electric bikes have removable batteries, so you can take them indoors to charge, but some may not. It may be more convenient anyway to charge the battery in situ.</p>\n<p>Charge times can be several hours, so if your bike is used intensively, you may need spare batteries to keep the motor running. Electric bike batteries are usually quite expensive, so spares will add significantly to the purchase cost.</p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"a648e7389297520ea7fa16d53d1db6bdc9968e3026974ddc0a8b69b0c8be681b","category":"Cycling"}
