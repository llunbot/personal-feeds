Most people infected—about 8 out of 10—will have no symptoms. But the unlucky remainder will develop a nondescript <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/symptoms/index.html\">illness with fever</a>, headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. Fatigue and weakness from a symptomatic case can linger for weeks to months. A small fraction of the symptomatic cases will develop a serious, life-threatening neuroinvasive case, such as meningitis or encephalitis.</p>\n<p>West Nile Virus (WNV) was discovered in the US in 1999 and first detected in Arizona in 2003, when just 12 cases were recorded. Since then, the state's <a href=\"https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/mosquito-borne/west-nile-virus/index.php#information\">yearly totals</a> have often been around 100 cases, with Maricopa County always claiming the lion's share. The outbreak record was set in 2004, quickly after its discovery. That year, the state saw 391 cases, 355 of which were from Maricopa.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935003#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935003&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"54342cf529faedab2b314e4149ba470a1abcc6b9beeff9bd8b169b784780165e","category":"Tech"}
