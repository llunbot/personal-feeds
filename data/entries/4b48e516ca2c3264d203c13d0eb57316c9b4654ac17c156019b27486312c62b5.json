Now, hundreds of ex-employees have <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ma-v-Twitter-Petition-to-Compel-Arbitration-7-3-2023.pdf\">sued again</a>, this time alleging in a class-action claim that \"Twitter has refused to engage in arbitration—despite having compelled employees to arbitrate their claims.\"</p>\n<p>According to the complaint, filed Monday in a San Francisco federal court, Twitter won't come to the table simply because the company doesn't want to pay for arbitration. Its arbitration agreements require ex-employees to pay a nominal filing fee to launch claims with the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS), but after that, Twitter has to pay \"all other arbitration fees.\"</p>\n<p>Faced with paying perhaps millions in fees for approximately 2,000 laid-off employees, Twitter allegedly sent a letter to JAMS in early June, requesting that the fees instead be split between parties.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951709#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951709&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4b48e516ca2c3264d203c13d0eb57316c9b4654ac17c156019b27486312c62b5","category":"Tech"}
