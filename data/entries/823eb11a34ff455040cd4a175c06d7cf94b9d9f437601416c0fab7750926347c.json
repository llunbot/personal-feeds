That pricing puts electric shifting systems from Shimano and SRAM out of reach for many riders. OG Bikeworks wants to change that with its new NXS Wireless Shifter System – and not just a new wireless shifting system, but a way to convert existing mechanical derailleurs to wireless. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>OG Bikeworks quietly announced the NXS Wireless Shifting System on April 8th, 2025. The brand recently followed that up with a <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/107180153/nxs-wireless-shifting-open-ecosystem\">Kickstarter campaign</a> that launched on May 1st. The Kickstarter is offering a limited number of the earliest backers the chance to get in at the super-early-bird price of just $79.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who is OG Bikeworks?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>OG Bikeworks was founded by Paul Gallagher, a cycling industry veteran who previously worked for brands like Hayes and SRAM on various projects. He’s no stranger to product development and has even dabbled in wireless shifting before. In fact, Gallagher was behind the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/xshifter-brings-wireless-electronic-shifting-bike-derailleur/\">XShifter system that Tyler covered way back in 2016</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gallagher reassured us that NXS is not just a relaunch of the XShifter system. He said, “The NXS Wireless Shifting System is a completely new platform, developed from the ground up.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the press release, OG Bikeworks “created NXS because current wireless systems are locked down and overpriced. Cyclists deserve freedom — the freedom to choose any derailleur, fine-tune performance, and ride how they want.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div><figcaption>The NXS Wireless Shifting System appears to be functional, with a well-developed app for programming and customization: (video/OG Bikeworks)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the NXS Wireless Shifting System?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>OG Bikeworks calls NXS “an open-platform wireless shifting system that works with any derailleur, any bike, any handlebar — without forcing you into a locked ecosystem.” Essentially, it aims to be a universally compatible system that can convert any cable-actuated derailleur into a wireless shifting system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the video and photos presented on the Kickstarter page, the NXS 1X MTB Kit is fully developed, functional, and ready for production. The system consists of a wireless handlebar remote and a compact shifter unit. It claims to be compatible with any rear derailleur and is fully programmable and customizable through the NXS Android App — an iOS version is reportedly coming soon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The handlebar remote is designed to mount to standard flat handlebar mounts. This compact remote has a CNC’d aluminum body with a molded silicone rubber touch pad and weighs a claimed 23 grams. It is powered by a standard CR2032 coin cell battery that is claimed to last 2-3 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shifter unit mounts directly to the derailleur and is reportedly just 50 mm long. The kit comes with multiple adapters to fit all the major derailleur brands. This compact, self-contained unit houses all the electronics, including the servo motor and USB-C rechargeable battery. OG Bikeworks claims a battery life of ~5,000 shifts per charge. The shifter unit weighs a claimed 55 to 60 grams, making the total system weight ~80 grams. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the remote and the shifter are claimed to be waterproof with an IP65 rating for riding in any weather condition. Additionally, the rear shifter’s ball-and-socket mounting system is designed to be both angle-adjustable and work like a built-in crash protection system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At present, OG Bikeworks only offers 1X MTB Kits, but they say that’s just the beginning. The brand claims that road-specific and dropper post kits are coming soon and that it is working on OEM integration with “innovative brands.” </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NXS-Wireless-System.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NXS-Wireless-System.webp\" alt=\"The NXS Wireless shifter attached to a Shimano derailleur with someone holding the wireless remote\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NXS-Wireless-System.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NXS-Wireless-System-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NXS-Wireless-System-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NXS-Wireless-System-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NXS-Wireless-System-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NXS-Wireless-System-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NXS-Wireless-System-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NXS-Wireless-System-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The NXS Wireless Shifting System appears quite polished and more streamlined than previous wireless conversion systems (photo/OG Bikeworks)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>NXS Protocol</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The remote and shifter are innovative in and of themselves, but the NXS wireless protocol is noteworthy in its own right. OG Bikeworks calls it a “modular control platform built on a robust, low-latency communication protocol with full API access.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only do they claim that shifting is faster than SRAM, but NXS was designed with future OEM integration in mind. With the ability to pair up to 6 NXS devices on the same wireless network, it seems that OG Bikeworks is hopeful that other brands license the NXS protocol when developing wireless components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The open API creates the potential for various component brands to use the same wireless protocol and integrate into the same ecosystem. That’s something that isn’t possible with current wireless systems, with SRAM’s AXS, Shimano’s Di2, and Fox’s Neo all being brand-specific.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NXS-Wireless-Remote.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NXS-Wireless-Remote.webp\" alt=\"The NXS wireless shifter mounted on a handlebar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NXS-Wireless-Remote.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NXS-Wireless-Remote-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NXS-Wireless-Remote-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NXS-Wireless-Remote-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NXS-Wireless-Remote-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NXS-Wireless-Remote-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NXS-Wireless-Remote-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NXS-Wireless-Remote-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>With its open API, there is potential that your NXS remote can control other components in the future (photo/OG Bikeworks)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Want In?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re interested in wireless shifting but not interested in shelling out big bucks for it, OG Bikeworks’ new NXS Wireless Shifting System may be the solution for you. Based on what we’ve read and seen, it should allow you to convert your existing cable-actuated derailleur into a wireless shifting system. And, it does this at a fraction of the cost of name-brand wireless shifting systems and with just a minimal weight penalty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that sounds appealing to you, now is your chance to be among the first to experience this new system. OG Bikeworks’ <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/107180153/nxs-wireless-shifting-open-ecosystem\">NXS Wireless Shifter Kickstarter campaign</a> is live now, so you can learn more or reserve your own. Twenty super-early-birds can buy in for the shockingly low price of just $79. Once those sell out, thirty early-birds can get in for $129. The Kickstarter special price of $149 takes over after that. The Kickstarter page says they’ll deliver anywhere in the world, with delivery estimated for August 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can learn more about the brand and NXS at <a href=\"https://ogbikeworks.com/\">ogbikeworks.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/nxs-wireless-shifting-system-will-convert-any-mechanical-derailleur-for-any-bike/\">NXS Wireless Shifting System Will Convert Any Mechanical Derailleur for Any Bike</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jeremy Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"823eb11a34ff455040cd4a175c06d7cf94b9d9f437601416c0fab7750926347c","category":"Cycling"}
