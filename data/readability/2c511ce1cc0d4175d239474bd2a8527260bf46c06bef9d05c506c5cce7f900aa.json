The front of the jersey features an abrasion-resistant windproof panel, while the rear is made from a proprietary merino wool blend. The sleeves are also made from a durable nylon fabric for snag-resistance, making a jersey that shelters you from the wind, but keeps things breathable out back.</p><h2>Trail Lightweight Jacket</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113803/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-jacket-turmeric-dark-purple.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113803/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-jacket-turmeric-dark-purple.jpg\" alt=\"Rapha Trail Lightweight Jacket\" width=\"2415\" height=\"1600\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113803/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-jacket-turmeric-dark-purple.jpg 2415w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113803/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-jacket-turmeric-dark-purple-297x197.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113803/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-jacket-turmeric-dark-purple-800x530.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113803/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-jacket-turmeric-dark-purple-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113803/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-jacket-turmeric-dark-purple-768x509.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113803/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-jacket-turmeric-dark-purple-1536x1018.jpg 1536w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113803/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-jacket-turmeric-dark-purple-2048x1357.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2415px) 100vw, 2415px\"></a></p><p>Initially launched with their summer gear, there are new colors of the Trail Lightweight Wind Jacket ($180) including the bright Turmeric.

That’s getting easier with better options than ever including the new Rapha Trail Pants ($180). Made from a durable woven stretch nylon fabric with a slight texture to the interior for comfort, the pants include a Durable Water Repellent finish. Like the Rapha Trail Shorts, the pants feature a contoured, variable-width belt system which is one of the best we’ve used.</p><p>There are two hand warmer pockets, and two hip pockets that are perfect for keeping a cell phone in place. There’s even a loop on the back which you could use for mounting a light for those times you’re pedaling to the trailhead. Meant to be worn with or without kneepads, the knees are reinforced for durability, and like all Rapha Trail products, the pants include a repair kit and can be sent back to Rapha Repairs if needed.</p><p>We’ve had a bit of time using these and can confirm—they’re as good as the Rapha Trailwear Shorts, which is to say they’re really, really good. The fit is excellent, with a tapered leg that isn’t tight but also won’t get caught in your chain or rub on your frame. I can wear either the small or medium shorts, but I’m glad Rapha sent the small pants this time around. My typical pants size is a 30/30, and the smalls fit very well.</p><h2>Women’s Performance Trailwear</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113814/Rapha-womens-trail-wear-mtb-fall-winter-clothing.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113814/Rapha-womens-trail-wear-mtb-fall-winter-clothing.jpg\" alt=\"Rapha Women's Performance Trailwear\" width=\"1738\" height=\"1600\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113814/Rapha-womens-trail-wear-mtb-fall-winter-clothing.jpg 1738w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113814/Rapha-womens-trail-wear-mtb-fall-winter-clothing-297x273.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113814/Rapha-womens-trail-wear-mtb-fall-winter-clothing-800x736.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113814/Rapha-womens-trail-wear-mtb-fall-winter-clothing-120x110.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113814/Rapha-womens-trail-wear-mtb-fall-winter-clothing-768x707.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113814/Rapha-womens-trail-wear-mtb-fall-winter-clothing-1536x1414.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1738px) 100vw, 1738px\"></a></p><p>All of the fall/winter Rapha Performance Trailwear products are also available in women’s fits, though with fewer color options.</p><h2>Trail Hip Pack &amp; Socks</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113800/Rapha-Trail-Hip-Pack-Old-gold.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113800/Rapha-Trail-Hip-Pack-Old-gold.jpg\" alt=\"Rapha Trail Hip Pack &amp; Socks\" width=\"2415\" height=\"1600\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113800/Rapha-Trail-Hip-Pack-Old-gold.jpg 2415w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113800/Rapha-Trail-Hip-Pack-Old-gold-297x197.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113800/Rapha-Trail-Hip-Pack-Old-gold-800x530.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113800/Rapha-Trail-Hip-Pack-Old-gold-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113800/Rapha-Trail-Hip-Pack-Old-gold-768x509.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113800/Rapha-Trail-Hip-Pack-Old-gold-1536x1018.jpg 1536w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12113800/Rapha-Trail-Hip-Pack-Old-gold-2048x1357.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2415px) 100vw, 2415px\"></a></p><p>While nothing has changed with the Trail Hip Pack ($80) since it was launched earlier this year, Rapha has added a new color called Old Gold.
