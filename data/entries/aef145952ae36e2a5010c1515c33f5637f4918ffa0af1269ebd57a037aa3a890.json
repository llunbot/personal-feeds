I’m Lauren Hall, a former professional cyclist, lifelong athlete, and<br />\nproud Moots ambassador. As someone who’s spent years chasing finish lines and now<br />\nthrives on exploring new roads and trails, I couldn’t be more excited to share my story<br />\nwith you.</p>\n<p><strong>A Little About Me</strong></p>\n<p>Growing up in Vicksburg, Mississippi, I was an all-around athlete, playing soccer,<br />\nbasketball, tennis, and running track. My passion for competition earned me a full<br />\nscholarship to play soccer at Mississippi State University, where I graduated in 2001.<br />\nAfter college, I explored different paths, from culinary school to managing child nutrition<br />\nprograms, before discovering cycling at 28 – a little late by traditional<br />\nstandards but just in time to find my true calling.</p>\n<p>Cycling became my world, and soon, I found myself racing professionally for eight years.<br />\nDuring that time, I raced for teams like Optum, United Healthcare, and Team Twenty16,<br />\ncompeted in four World Championships, and proudly represented the U.S. National<br />\nTeam in Europe for three seasons. One of my career highlights? Winning a spring<br />\nclassic, Gent-Wevelgem, in 2014- a victory that still feels surreal.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/c6df14a6-8d12-43f0-a442-3ba040a31c83.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"608\" height=\"612\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/c6df14a6-8d12-43f0-a442-3ba040a31c83.jpeg 608w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/c6df14a6-8d12-43f0-a442-3ba040a31c83-298x300.jpeg 298w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/c6df14a6-8d12-43f0-a442-3ba040a31c83-150x150.jpeg 150w\" /><br />\n<strong>Why Moots?</strong></p>\n<p>After retiring from the professional peloton, I sought a bike that would reconnect me with<br />\nthe pure joy of riding, my forever bike. Moots bikes have always been synonymous with<br />\ncraftsmanship, performance, timeless design, and the titanium frame needed with<br />\nmy current travel – all points that resonate deeply with me. When Moots provided<br />\nme with a Vamoots RCS, equipped with Shimano Dura-Ace, HED Vanquish 45 Pro<br />\nwheels, and aluminum bars (my choice), it reignited my love for exploring roads less<br />\ntraveled. That bike wasn’t just a tool; it became an extension of my passion for riding.<br />\nI’ve embraced a new cycling medium with a new Moots Routt RSL gravel bike decked out with SRAM Force, HED<br />\nwheels, WTB 44 tires, and ENVE bars.</p>\n<p>Gravel riding has been an exciting way to explore new places and create fresh<br />\nadventures. It’s taken me off the beaten path, offering a sense of freedom and discovery<br />\nthat feels different from my road racing days. From quiet backroads to rugged trails, this<br />\nbike has opened up endless opportunities for adventure and exploration.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image.jpg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-300x198.jpg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-768x507.jpg 768w\" /><br />\n<strong>What’s Next?</strong></p>\n<p>Through this blog series, I’ll share stories from my days in the pro peloton, my transition<br />\nto life off the bike, and how Moots inspires my adventures today. Beyond the<br />\nbike, I work for the USA Cycling Foundation, where I have the privilege of contributing to the mission of supporting athletes and the sport. This role allows me to be part of some<br />\nincredible experiences, from attending the men’s and women’s Tour de France trips to<br />\ncheering on our U.S. athletes at Road World Championships, Olympics and events<br />\nacross the U.S. Additionally, I’ve taken on a commentating role for marquee events like<br />\nthe Life Time Grand Prix series (see the YouTube series), SBT GRVL, and more.<br />\nIt’s a dynamic and exciting way to stay connected to the sport and community that have<br />\nshaped my life.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>-Lauren</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Join us monthly as Lauren details her transition from the pro peloton to her now impactful roll in the gravel community.  </em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://moots.com/blog/from-pro-peloton-to-the-moots-family-my-journey-on-and-off-the-bike/\">From Pro Peloton to the Moots Family: My Journey on and  Off the Bike</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://moots.com\">Moots Cycles</a>.</p>","author":"Elizabeth","siteTitle":"Moots","siteHash":"dbee4c0f87f6913283dcacd1f8b3e2603e0d744c0d8d7eea7b1691bee838c4cd","entryHash":"aef145952ae36e2a5010c1515c33f5637f4918ffa0af1269ebd57a037aa3a890","category":"Cycling"}
