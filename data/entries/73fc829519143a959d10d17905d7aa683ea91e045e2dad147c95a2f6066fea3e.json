That leaves BOE and Tianma as potential suppliers, however Tianma has not yet met Apple's stringent quality requirements, leaving BOE in pole position to win the majority of the orders, if not all of them.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe panel prices for the iPhone SE 4 are said to be a lot lower than suppliers charge for the OLED displays used in the iPhone 15, since the panels for the SE will use legacy parts identical to those used in the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14, so the suppliers won't need to make new investments in R&amp;D. Display manufacturers are believed to have been bidding to supply the panels since at least <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/11/suppliers-bidding-on-iphone-se-4-displays/\">last August</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-se-4-details/\">rumored</a> to feature an iPhone 14-like design with a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID instead of Touch ID, a USB-C port, an Action button, and an all-screen look that does away with the Home Button. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/iphone-se-4-design-revealed-in-cad-renders/\">CAD renders</a> of the device corroborated previous design rumors for the iPhone SE 4, which is expected to launch in 2025. Despite the rumored upgrades, the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 may face faster depreciation than Apple's higher-end models, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/iphone-se-4-expected-to-depreciate-heavily/\">according to one report</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/\">OLED</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/boe/\">BOE</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/iphone-se-4-oled-supplier-likely-boe/\">6.1-Inch iPhone SE 4 OLED Panel Likely to Be Supplied by China's BOE</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/6-1-inch-iphone-se-4-oled-panel-likely-to-be-supplied-by-chinas-boe.2422926/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"73fc829519143a959d10d17905d7aa683ea91e045e2dad147c95a2f6066fea3e","category":"Apple"}
