For reference, Park Tool’s TS-4.2 weighs a claimed 16kg.</p>\n<p>Putting the stand together is straightforward. Once you’ve mounted the stand to the base or vice plate, simply fit the plastic holders that host the RWS skewers and attach the multi-link arms. DT Swiss recommends tightening the nut on the multi-link arm to 15Nm.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"DT Swiss Wheel Truing Stand against a wall\" title=\"DT Swiss Truing Stand\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Once you’ve attached the relevant adaptor and RWS skewer, the wheel installs into the uprights.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>You can choose where you mount the multi-link arms, but I opted to mount the radial runout at the bottom-left and the lateral indicator at the bottom-right.</p>\n<p>Installing a wheel is slightly more involved than other stands. You need to install the relevant truing adaptor onto the end cap of the wheel and then attach it using the RWS axle.</p>\n<p>You need to make sure they’re fully tightened because any play at the hub will amplify on the stand when it comes to truing.</p>\n<p>On other stands, such as Park’s TS-4.2, the uprights feature an integrated thru-axle holder, forgoing the need for any adaptors.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"DT Swiss Wheel Truing Stand against a wall\" title=\"DT Swiss Truing Stand\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The dial indicators are a joy to use.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>The dial indicator gauges are phenomenal and adjustments can be made to a satisfyingly tight tolerance.</p>\n<p>You simply set the tolerance marks to the minimum and maximum points the dial shows at, and work from there.</p>\n<p>The anodised red multi-link arms have a stunning appearance and adjusting their position is a step to relish. Simply turn the ergonomic dial and in less than half a turn, the whole of the arm flops, so you can adjust its position and angle with ease.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"DT Swiss Wheel Truing Stand against a wall\" title=\"DT Swiss Truing Stand\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Just look at that handle.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Although the centre mark gives a rough indication of whether you’ve achieved the correct dish, it’s not as simple as being able to rely on the caliper arms. This is why a specific wheel dishing tool is the best option for perfect results.</p>\n<p>However, the benefit of this design is that unlike other stands, the DT Swiss version won’t require calibration.</p>\n<p>Other stands require the uprights to be centred perfectly to give an accurate representation of wheel dishing, often via the use of a calibrating gauge. This is an additional expense and means you’re best storing a truing stand in a specific place to avoid it getting knocked.</p>\n<p>Although DT Swiss’ Wheel Truing Stand is very expensive, it would be an excellent option for workshops, or if you’re regularly building or truing wheels.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>","author":"Oscar Huckle","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"0ef7c47ccb63e6e0bff63f728a7a2e0c98977a7e4fd1f64a6ca3693d32cd6330","category":"Cycling"}
