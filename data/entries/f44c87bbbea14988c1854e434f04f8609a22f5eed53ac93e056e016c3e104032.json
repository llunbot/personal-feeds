At the back, the fast pick-up of Hunt’s own alloy hub proved reliable throughout testing.</p>\n<p>Built from stronger 6069-T6 aluminium, the Enduro Wides are heavier than some, as you’d expect for their intended purpose, but only by a small margin.</p>\n<p>The rear wheel can come with any flavour of freehub, as well as Boost or Super Boost hub spacing.</p>\n<p>Hunt will sell you the wheels with Schwalbe or Maxxis tyres pre-installed, but tyres are easy to fit and blow up with just a track pump.</p>\n<p>In addition to a three-year warranty, Hunt offers a 35 per cent crash-replacement scheme.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/hunt-enduro-wide-v2-wheelset-review/\">Read our full Hunt Enduro Wide V2 wheelset review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Nukeproof Horizon V2</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Nukeproof Horizon V2 mountain bike wheelset\" title=\"Nukeproof Horizon V2\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> These Nukeproofs are a burly set of all-mountain wheels.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £400/$634 as tested</li>\n<li>Best suited to <strong>all-mountain riding</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Decent rear hub; well thought-out construction</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> There are lighter wheels</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Nukeproof Horizon V2 wheels have a slightly damped feel that takes the edge off square-edged hits and gives plenty of grip over matted roots.</p>\n<p>Nukeproof claims the rim material has the hardness of a 7-series alloy but the ductility of a 6-series, to balance strength, stiffness and weight. We found the ride feel to be on a par with most of the alloy wheels here.</p>\n<p>While both rim profiles are the same, the rear is built with thicker sidewalls to boost its strength. The wheels are laced with 32 J-bend spokes. Nukeproof’s Horizon V2 hub has heftily-sealed bearings and a satisfying buzz. We were impressed by the freehub’s quick pick-up, too.</p>\n<p>The brand offers plenty of spec options for the hubs and all three freehub options. Its tubeless valves, which channel air past tyre inserts and have a valve-core tool in the cap, are a nice touch. Fitting and seating tyres is a cinch. For the price, these are a solid option.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheelset-review/\">Read our full Nukeproof Horizon V2 wheelset review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Sector 9i</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Sector 9i wheelset\" title=\"Sector 9i wheelset\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> They track precisely enough that we could easily pinpoint, and stick to, the same lines every time.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £1,100 as tested</li>\n<li>Best suited to <strong>enduro or all-mountain riding</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Impressively stiff and light but tough enough to withstand abuse</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Graphic may divide opinion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Weighing 1,690g for the pair (29in), they’re some of the lightest enduro wheels out there and have survived plenty of rock and root impacts out on the trail.</p>\n<p>They track the ground well and don’t create a disconnect between the trail and rider, but remain compliant enough to not cause discomfort on rough descents.</p>\n<p>If you like the graphics and can afford them, the Sector 9i wheels are well worth considering.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/sector-9i-wheelset-review/\">Read our full Sector 9i wheelset review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Zipp 3ZERO MOTO</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Zipp 3ZERO MOTO mountain bike wheelset\" title=\"Zipp 3ZERO MOTO\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Zipp 3ZERO MOTO wheels proved to be among our favourites.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £1,645/$1,800/€1,840 as tested</li>\n<li>Best suited to <strong>trail riding</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Excellent control and comfort; fast pickup and easy hub maintenance</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> No Shimano Microspline option</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Zipp 3ZERO MOTO wheels are a great-riding set of carbon wheels with a comfortable yet accurate feel.

These ones, built around its 370 hubs, are some of its cheapest MTB hoops. Ours had a 29.6mm internal rim width; a 25mm option is available, too.</p>\n<p>The M1900s aren’t noticeably harsh, nor too soft, as 28-spoke alloy wheels can tend to be. As such, we were able to hold our lines easily over off-camber roots and never felt as though we were being pinged all over the place.</p>\n<p>The freehub’s 15-degree engagement angle is wider than most, so doesn’t give the snappiest acceleration. The flipside is that on a full-sus bike there might be more leeway before pedal kickback comes into play.</p>\n<p>Fitting tyres posed no particular issues, and they inflated easily.</p>\n<p>With a weight limit of 120kg, heavier riders on e-MTBs may need to look at DT’s e-specific range instead. In all, the M1900s are a solid pair of wheels for the money, with plenty of hub adaptability and easy set-up.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/dt-swiss-m1900-spline-wheelset-review/\">Read our full DT Swiss M1900 Spline wheelset review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>ENVE MTB Foundation AM30</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"ENVE MTB Foundation AM30 mountain bike wheelset\" title=\"ENVE MTB Foundation AM30\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> ENVE’s carbon wheels are right-fancy.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £1,850 as tested</li>\n<li>Best suited to <strong>all-mountain riding</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Excellent hubs; very good backup and warranty</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Don’t come taped</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ENVE’s more accessibly priced (for the US brand) Foundation hoops are still expensive but have a communicative, firm and refined ride that isn’t jarring.</p>\n<p>They’re lightweight yet strong, hand-built in the US and UK with 28 Sapim Race double-butted spokes per wheel, and adorned with beautiful Industry Nine 1/1 hubs, which have a snappy pick-up, are easy to maintain and stay almost silent.</p>\n<p>The direct, accurate feel means the A30s don’t give the smoothest ride.

They aren’t exactly harsh but have a direct, stiff feel, which is good through corners because there’s little flex, but they won’t mask a fork that needs a service, nor be forgiving on a hardtail.</p>\n<p>Aggressive or heavier riders may appreciate their stout nature because they feel less likely to buckle under higher loads and give confidence when pummelling through rocks.</p>\n<p>We’d also wager they’d feel good on an ebike. With the widest rims on test, at 33mm internal, this burly, 32-spoke alloy wheelset gives good volume and support to tyres up to 2.8in.</p>\n<p>We found it tricky to fit tighter tyres due to the shape of the rim bed.</p>\n<p>Despite their extra grams, the wheels feel positive when pedalling thanks to the freehub’s 120 points of engagement and fast pick-up. Its buzz is fairly loud, though, and servicing the rear bearings requires cone spanners.

If you’re a cross-country racer looking for all-out speed then a wheel’s weight is going to be your primary concern over its strength.</p>\n<p>Trail and all-mountain riders will want to balance strength and weight, looking for the perfect compromise for their individual riding styles.</p>\n<p>Gravity-focused riders, enduro or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/downhill-mountain-biking-explained/\">downhill</a>, should look at prioritising strength over weight, although generally speaking the more you spend the lighter and stronger wheels should be.</p>\n<p>Also consider how hard you ride. If you’re a heavier or more aggressive rider, you should shy away from lightweight wheels and look for a sturdy set with a higher spoke count – most likely 32 spokes laced in the three-cross pattern.</p>\n<p>If you’re a lightweight rider or if you use a lot of finesse on the trail, you can probably get away with running a lighter-weight wheelset or one with fewer spokes.</p>\n<h3>Axle standards</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The rear hub has interchangeable end caps for quick release, 12x142 thru and Boost 12x148 thru axles.\" title=\"sm_roam_50_hub-1485283003099-fh9iwrd8pjt4-735b22d\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This rear hub has interchangeable end caps for quick release, 12×142 thru-axles and Boost 12×148 thru-axles.</span></figcaption><span> <i>SRAM</i></span></div>\n<p>Over the past five years, axles have transitioned from decades-old quick-releases to thru-axles, which offer a stiffer, more secure interface. There are several <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/mtb-axle-standards/\" target=\"_blank\">MTB axle standards</a> to be aware of.</p>\n<p>The 100x15mm front and 142x12mm rear thru-axles were common a few years ago, but the desire to increase wheel stiffness has led manufacturers to move to the wider ‘Boost’ axle spacing, which uses a 110x15mm front axle with a 148x12mm rear thru-axle.</p>\n<p>If you’re buying a high-end mountain bike, these days, nearly all of them will feature Boost axle spacing.</p>\n<p>More recently, ‘Super Boost’ spacing, found on a growing number of bikes, is becoming more common. This standard increases the axle width further, in theory, to improve stiffness once more.</p>\n<section>\n    <div>\n        \n<h4>What is Boost and Super Boost hub spacing?</h4>\n<p>Hub spacing refers to the distance between the two ends of the hub’s axle or the gap between the inside of the dropouts on your frame or fork.</p>\n<p>Bikes and hubs with standard <strong>Boost</strong> spacing measure 148mm wide. This means the hub flanges are further apart compared to a standard 142mm axle hub.</p>\n<p>Wider hub flanges cause the wheel’s spokes to be braced from a wider angle, too. This increase in angle leads to stronger wheels.</p>\n<p><strong>Super Boost</strong> hubs are 157mm wide, and just like normal Boost spacing the increase in width is seen with wider-still hub flanges improving strength further.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find out more about <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-big-of-a-deal-is-super-boost/?image=1&amp;type=gallery&amp;gallery=1&amp;embedded_slideshow=1\">Super Boost hub spacing</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section>\n\n<p>Before purchasing a new wheelset, make sure it uses the same axle type and width as your frame.</p>\n<p>You might also want to consider looking for a hub that can be changed to a different axle size should you change your frame but want to keep your wheels at a later date.</p>\n<h3>Carbon or alloy rims?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"3ZERO Moto\" title=\"3ZERO Moto\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Zipp’s first MTB wheelset brings an unusual approach to carbon wheels.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Dan Hearn/SRAM</i></span></div>\n<p>Increasingly, high-end wheelsets are built around carbon fibre rims. Compared to aluminium, carbon rims can be as stiff or stiffer at a lower weight. That’s not to say you should completely write off aluminium rims, though.</p>\n<p>If you’re not concerned with ultimate weight savings or ultimate stiffness, but are looking to upgrade to a higher performance wheelset with an affordable price, then there are many quality aluminium wheelsets to choose from.</p>\n<p>Aluminium rims are more likely to be dented or dinged in an impact before they crack or fail entirely. Carbon rims, however, are less likely to show signs of damage until they fail completely.</p>\n<h3>Rim width</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"mountain bike wheel set\" title=\"DT Swiss EX 1501 Spline One 30 04\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> These tough rims have an internal width of 30mm.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Georgina Hinton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Rim width has increased for both road and mountain bikes. The critical dimension to keep in mind is the internal width.</p>\n<p>This distance determines the shape of your tyres. For a given tyre, a wider rim will increase tyre volume and give the tyre a flatter, squared-off profile. A narrower rim will decrease tyre volume and give the tyre a rounder profile.</p>\n<p>Wider rims can also increase tyre stability, which can make your bike feel more predictable through corners. At the same time, tyres are designed with specific rim widths in mind. Going too wide can cause the knobs on the sides of a tyre to sit too high, resulting in less grip through turns.</p>\n<p>Pairing rim and tyre width is a key consideration – especially with so many tyre widths to choose from. Here are some rough guidelines to get you started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2–2.25in tyres = 23–25mm rim widths</li>\n<li>2.25–2.4in tyres = 25–30mm rim widths</li>\n<li>2.4–2.6in tyres = 30–35mm rim widths</li>\n<li>2.6–3in tyres = 35–40mm rim widths</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have a favourite tyre width and tread pattern, keep in mind which rim width you want to pair it with when buying a new wheelset.</p>\n<h3>Tubeless or tubes?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tubeless setup has become much easier with the introduction of products like the Airshot.\" title=\"1432826818665-lr4b34yvxr80-1475594274394-cmhcs4agdw72-97e96f6\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tubeless setup has become much easier with the introduction of products such as the Airshot.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The debate over whether to run inner tubes or to rely on a tyre containing only sealant boils down to personal preference.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-inner-tubes/\">Inner tubes</a> are affordable and easy to replace without much fuss (or mess), but they’re also prone to punctures and generally require the rider to run higher pressures.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">Tubeless</a> systems are lighter and have the added benefit of being able to self-seal some small punctures. Tubeless tyres are more expensive and if you do get a flat, you’ll have to deal with a bit of a mess. As a result, you may wonder: is <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tubeless-sealant-environmental-impact/\">tubeless sealant bad for the environment</a>?</p>\n<p>Equally, if you rip the tyre’s carcass beyond repair you’ll need to dispose of your tyre or use an inner tube anyway.</p>\n<p>However you choose to roll, nearly all modern mountain bike wheelsets are tubeless-compatible.</p>\n<h3>Engagement speed</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The Enternity hub also features ultra fast freehub engagement\" title=\"1442797390560-1m9frqttps4r1-b1a7d72\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Freehubs usually engage using small spring-loaded pawls that push into a groove to ‘grip’.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Rome / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>One often overlooked wheel feature is how fast the freehub engages.</p>\n<p>This speed is actually a measure of the distance your crank travels before the pawls inside the freehub engage the teeth of the drive ring to propel you forward. It is most often discussed in terms of ‘points of engagement’ or ‘degrees of engagement’. More points will result in fewer degrees and a faster freehub.</p>\n<p>You can figure out the degrees of engagement by dividing the points of engagement by 360. For example, a hub with 36 points of engagement will have 10 degrees of free play. Another hub with 120 points of engagement will have three degrees of movement until it engages.</p>\n<p>The differences in engagement speed is noticeable on the trail. In general, a faster freehub is better for pedalling. A hub with a high number of points of engagement will allow you to get back up to speed quickly after coasting with less lag.</p>\n<p>It can make it easier to ‘ratchet’ up technical climbs – a technique where the rider takes a half or quarter pedal stroke in situations where there might not be enough time, or pedal clearance, for a complete stroke.</p>\n<p>Engagement can also be a matter of diminishing returns once you reach a certain point. Additionally, the tighter tolerances of fast-engaging freehubs can require more maintenance because they’re less tolerant of contamination. They also tend to be louder and can have more drag, although this isn’t always the case.</p>\n<p>Hub and wheel manufacturer <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/dt-swiss-240-hubs/\">DT Swiss recently speculated</a> that a higher number of engagement points on a mountain bike hub can actually increase pedal kickback (depending on the bike’s suspension kinematics). It suggested a hub with 36 points of engagement, and therefore 10 degrees of free play, is the best compromise.</p>\n<p> </p>","author":"Alex Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"f44c87bbbea14988c1854e434f04f8609a22f5eed53ac93e056e016c3e104032","category":"Cycling"}
