The new models still start at $1,299 can be <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/imac\">preordered starting today</a> and will begin arriving on November 8.</p>\n<p>Processor aside, the biggest functional upgrade to the base model may be the bump from 8GB to 16GB of RAM, the first time Apple has bumped up the RAM in a base-model Mac since 2012. The base iMac's price is staying the same at $1,299, effectively saving you $200 compared to the M1 and M3 models. Base storage remains the same at 256GB, though it is at least possible to add external storage; there's no way to add RAM to a Mac after you've bought it.</p>\n<p>The new iMacs also come with tweaked versions of the existing Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad accessories that use USB-C ports for charging rather than Lightning ports. These were some of the last remaining Lightning products in Apple's lineup; the iPhone SE and iPhone 14 are still keeping Lightning alive for now.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/10/apples-1299-m4-imac-at-long-last-bumps-the-base-model-to-16gb-of-ram/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/10/apples-1299-m4-imac-at-long-last-bumps-the-base-model-to-16gb-of-ram/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6c49663742bfe80921847c9d82ae2f5e5e81607f040f4a122fb44693eb5a661d","category":"Tech"}
