(The full title is the decidedly unwieldy <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_World_of_John_Wick:_Ballerina\"><em>From the World of John Wick: Ballerina</em></a>.) Lionsgate just dropped the first trailer, and it has all the tight action choreography and eye-popping visuals we've come to expect from the franchise—including a cameo by none other than the Baba Yaga himself (Keanu Reeves).</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for <em>John Wick Chapter 3</em> and <em>Chapter 4</em> below.)</strong></p>\n<p><em>Parabellum</em> found Wick declared excommunicado from the High Table for killing crime lord Santino D'Antonio on the grounds of the Continental. On the run with a bounty on his head, he makes his way to the headquarters of the Ruska Roma crime syndicate, led by the Director (Anjelica Huston). That's where we learned Wick was originally named Jardani Jovonovich and trained as an assassin with the syndicate. The Director also trains young girls to be ballerina-assassins, and one young ballerina (played by Unity Phelan) is shown rehearsing in the scene. That dancer is the main character in <em>Ballerina</em>, now played by Ana de Armas.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052825#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052825&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"728e47aecd0072dfce62befd7edc56b374ad7076cf40832179d00f0703092658","category":"Tech"}
