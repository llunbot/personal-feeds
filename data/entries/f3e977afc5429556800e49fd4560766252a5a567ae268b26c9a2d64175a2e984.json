As a result, they should be less expensive to produce but just as fast as certified MagSafe chargers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have more details on Qi2 (properly Qi v2.0 MPP, for Magnetic Power Profile) in our explainer <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2128673/what-is-qi2-is-qi2-iphone-wireless-charging-better-than-magsafe.html\" target=\"_blank\">Is Qi2 better than MagSafe</a>?</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Belkin-Qi2-3in1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Belkin BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Magnetic Stand\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Belkin-Qi2-3in1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Belkin-Qi2-3in1.jpg?resize=300%2C162&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Belkin-Qi2-3in1.jpg?resize=768%2C415&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"554\" /></figure><p>Belkin</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Belkin Qi2 chargers announced at CES 2024</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Early to the WPO partner list, Belkin unveiled the first of its Qi2 chargers at IFA 2023 last September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Belkin BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Magnetic Stand with Qi2 15W Pad</strong>, pictured above, can simultaneously charge three Apple devices, with Qi2 delivering 15W of fast wireless charging for iPhone, 5W for AirPods, and a fast-charging 5W module to wirelessly charge an Apple Watch.
