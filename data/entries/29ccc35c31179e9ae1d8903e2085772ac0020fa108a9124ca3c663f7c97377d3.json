{"title":"The continued iPad watch and everything else coming from Apple in April","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2281443/apple-april-2024-releases-macs-ipads-ios-macos-appletv.html","date":1711970100000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>March delivered some actual new Apple hardware in the form of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2259608/15-inch-macbook-air-m3-review.html\">M3 MacBook Air</a>, but we didn’t get the new iPads we were expecting. Rumor has it those are still on the way, they’re just going to drop in April instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve also been in a strange break between software releases. We expected iOS 17.4 and macOS 14.4 to be followed immediately by beta test versions of iOSO 17.5 and macOS 14.5, but it’s been weeks now with no beta and only a couple small bugfix/security updates. We don’t think Apple is done with the 17/14 generation of operating system updates, but it’s up in the air exactly when the next releases will drop.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rumored new hardware: iPads</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We thought new iPads might ship along with the new M3 MacBook Air in March, but the month came and went with no announcement. Then rumors reported an April release, but the latest from Mark Gurman at Bloomberg is that they’re <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2282952/ipad-pro-ipad-air-launch-shipping-may-2024.html\">not going to be available until early in May</a>. Apparently the software is taking a little more time to finish up, and the new manufacturing processes for the new iPads have caused some minor delays. However, even if the new iPads do indeed slip into early May, there’s a chance we could still get an announcement of them in late April (with availability the following week, at the start of May).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/2024-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">iPad Pro</a> probably gets its biggest update, with a switch to an OLED display and the camera moved to the long edge of the tablet (so it’s on top when held in landscape orientation).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110304/ipad-air-2024-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html\">iPad Air</a> is said to get an M2 upgrade and a landscape-oriented front camera. Most rumors suggest a 12.9-inch model will also be added, though some <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2274846/12-9-inch-ipad-air-not-coming-rumor.html\">recent rumblings</a> suggest that won’t happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, a new version of iOS/iPadOS and macOS enter beta immediately following each point release. But there was no iOS 17.5 or macOS 14.5 beta after the 17.4 and 14.4 releases. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We certainly expect a beta of iOS and iPadOS 17.5 and macOS 14.5 in April, but the final release will likely fall to May, and since the beta isn’t out yet we can’t even say what features or changes might be included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Gurman’s report on iPad delays claims Apple is working on a new version of iOS 17.4, which suggests the next round of updates won’t arrive until later in May.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Services</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple TV+</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the shows, series, and movies we expect to release on Apple TV+ in April.
