But Microsoft isn't totally unresponsive to user criticism when it comes to Edge—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/12/preview-builds-begin-to-fix-windows-11s-start-menu-and-taskbar/\">the latest Dev channel Windows Insider build of Windows 11</a> restores a button in the Settings app for setting your default browser, something that existed in Windows 10 but is missing from the current stable version of Windows 11.</p>\n\n<p>The change, originally <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WithinRafael/status/1466183359680299009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">spotted by developer Rafael Rivera</a>, adds the default browser button to the top of the Settings app when you navigate to any browser in the \"Default apps\" section. The button automatically changes the default app for opening http, https, .htm, and .html files and links instead of making users change each of these associations manually (or relying on browser makers to build that capability into their browsers themselves).</p>\n<p>For all the other file types that Microsoft Edge can handle, including PDFs, SVG files, and others, you'll still need to change those associations manually and one at a time. But this is already how the default browser button worked in Windows 10, so it at least represents a reversion to the pre-Windows 11 status quo rather than a new hurdle to jump over.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817869#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817869&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c2122c86cb1c33864c593743b89c698db227e8d311376c8b09bd524fe2c77031","category":"Tech"}
