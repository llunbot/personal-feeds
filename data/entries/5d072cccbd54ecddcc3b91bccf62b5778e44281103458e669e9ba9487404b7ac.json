It’s happened—numerous times. Being a small business owner, money gets tight quite often, and I deal in the currency of bicycles. So if I’m coming up short on rent or even just trying to free up funds for a new build project, I’m usually selling something to pay off something else.</p>\n<p>I’ve repeatedly thought about selling my Mamiya 7ii but have always resisted, opting to part with a bike instead.</p>\n<p>Remember that tall Eddy Merckx track bike? Or <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/beautiful-bicycle-my-bishop-road-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">my Bishop road bike</a>? What about the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/1991-team-fat-chance-yo-eddy/\" target=\"_blank\">Yo Eddy</a>? Even the Urban Racer above? Yep. I could list the bikes I’ve let go in the time I’ve owned this camera but I don’t want to eat up any more space here. In fact, I think I even sold a bike to buy the Mamiya 7ii!</p>\n<p>I’ve probably owned and sold more digital and film cameras in the same amount of time. Yet one camera keeps its place in my cabinet like a rent control apartment in New York City. It’s never moving because if it did, I wouldn’t be able to replace it. I look at my “work” cameras—modern digital bayonets—as what they are: tools. A means to an end. But there’s something special about the Mamiya 7ii.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-7.jpg?fit=1200,800&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-7.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-7.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-7.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Mamiya 7ii Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Made in Japan</li>\n<li>Plastic body, plastic lens; the weight is in the glass, where it matters most</li>\n<li>6×7</li>\n<li>120/220 Film</li>\n<li>0.57 Viewfinder</li>\n<li>Six, leaf shutter lenses available</li>\n<li>Not cheap (anymore)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Bajacalifornia_02.jpg?fit=1200,675&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Bajacalifornia_02.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Bajacalifornia_02.jpg?resize=1200,675&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Bajacalifornia_02.jpg?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Bajacalifornia_02.jpg?resize=1536,864&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Baja California, Crop, Ektar 100, 2022</em></p>\n<h3>Lineage</h3>\n<p>Mamiya was founded in Japan in 1940 by two Tokyo-based engineers, Mamiya Seiichi and Sugawara Tsunejirō, whose first lauded achievement was the Mamiya Six. This 6×6 folding camera was quirky and it focused by moving the film plane on the body.</p>\n<p>Later, in 1984, the Mamiya 6 was released and, like its Mamiya Six predecessor, it used a 6×6 format but had been updated to use a rangefinder focusing method and leaf shutter. The body was metal and it was a stout camera, but that didn’t keep people from buying it because, compared to other medium format cameras like the Hasselblad 500x series, it was fast to focus and resilient. The Mamiya 6 allowed for various Mamiya lenses to be swapped in.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1632\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii_Archives5.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii_Archives5.jpg?w=1632&amp;quality=75 1632w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii_Archives5.jpg?resize=1200,1471&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii_Archives5.jpg?resize=768,941&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii_Archives5.jpg?resize=1253,1536&amp;quality=75 1253w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1632\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya_Baja22.jpg?fit=1200,1632&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya_Baja22.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya_Baja22.jpg?resize=1200,979&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya_Baja22.jpg?resize=768,627&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya_Baja22.jpg?resize=1536,1253&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Mojave, Portra 400, 2012 (left); Baja, Ektar 100, 2022 </em></p>\n<p>In 1995, the Mamiya 7 was produced, ending the Mamiya 6 line with the MF, or “multi-format” model, which allowed for the use of 6×6, 6×4.5, and even 35 mm (with an adapter), 120 or 220 film.</p>\n<p>First introduced in 1999—the year I graduated high school—the Mamiya 7ii was released just four years after the Mamiya 7 in 1995. This was an uncommon occurrence in an era of medium-format cameras. As was its production run of fifteen years, running from 1999 all the way until 2014. Up until then, you could still send your Mamiya 7ii into Mamiya for a service and replacement parts were still being made.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1602\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/BackpackingCanyonlandsFilm-81.jpg?fit=1200,1602&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/BackpackingCanyonlandsFilm-81.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/BackpackingCanyonlandsFilm-81.jpg?resize=1200,961&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/BackpackingCanyonlandsFilm-81.jpg?resize=768,615&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/BackpackingCanyonlandsFilm-81.jpg?resize=1536,1230&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1602\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/BackpackingCanyonlandsFilm-22.jpg?fit=1200,1602&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/BackpackingCanyonlandsFilm-22.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/BackpackingCanyonlandsFilm-22.jpg?resize=1200,961&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/BackpackingCanyonlandsFilm-22.jpg?resize=768,615&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/BackpackingCanyonlandsFilm-22.jpg?resize=1536,1230&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Canyonlands, Ektar 100, 2022</em></p>\n<h3>Specifications</h3>\n<p>The Mamiya 7ii epitomizes the height of the Japanese rangefinder, medium-format technology with a bolstered 67 mm diameter lens mount, scaled up from the Mamiya 6’s 52.5 mm, providing a larger diaphragm for the in-lens leaf shutter and an enhanced light shield. The Mamiya 7ii’s shutter is actually in the lens itself, not the camera body, making the body ultra lightweight.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-4.jpg?fit=1200,800&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-4.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-4.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-4.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>With the growth in lens mount diameter came a larger frame size, with the 7ii sporting a bang for your buck: a whopping 6×7 120/220 negative. Like the Mamiya 6, you can even run 35 mm film through it with a panoramic kit, resulting in a 24×65 mm negative. To switch between 120 and 220 film, simply rotate the tension plate shown above.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-3.jpg?fit=1200,800&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-3.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-3.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-3.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Its shutter speed and flash sync are limited to 1/500th, and its light meter uses a simple center-weighted pattern in the form of an SPD system. Yet, it is not a TTL (or through-the-lens) light meter, meaning you’ve got to remember to take the lens cap off (or just throw it away like all lens caps and use a filter). Before dealing with the lens cap ordeal, I shot many rolls with countless blank exposures.

On a Hasselblad 500X system, you’re looking through the lens like the Canon AE-1. On a rangefinder, you’re looking through the rangefinder system, a small window that holds the focusing mechanism for the camera. On a Mamiya 7ii, the lens is closed to light by the leaf shutter, so you can’t look through the lens.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1597\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Backpacking_Spring2022-11.jpg?fit=1200,1597&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Backpacking_Spring2022-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Backpacking_Spring2022-11.jpg?resize=1200,958&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Backpacking_Spring2022-11.jpg?resize=768,613&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Backpacking_Spring2022-11.jpg?resize=1536,1226&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Spring Backpacking, Ektar 100, 2022</em></p>\n<p>With a rangefinder, you align two small rectangles over each other to achieve focus. It’s brilliantly quick, even faster than a digital camera’s spot focus, and accurate. You can still set the range on the lens to shoot stopped-down for street photography. For framing, you have to rely on the rangefinder mechanism’s lines.</p>\n<p><em>The Mamiya 7ii uses a 0.57 magnification viewfinder.</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-11.jpg?fit=1200,800&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-11.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-11.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-11.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>However, there is one slight issue with a rangefinder: parallax distortion. This happens because you’re looking out of the camera to the left of the lens, and the lens is what captures the image on the emulsion. In my first few rolls of film, when I shot objects or people up close, they were all right-justified because of this. It took some time and patience to develop a bit of angular projection to compensate for this framing. I began slightly moving the camera left about 5-10º to correct for framing close subjects.</p>\n<p>The Mamiya 7ii has parallax compensation built into the rangefinder viewfinder. Focusing will cause the bright lines displayed to shift to show the adjusted composition. The distortion is non-existent for medium-range and landscape photos. Compared to other rangefinders that I’ve used like Contax, Minolta, or even a Leica, the Mamiya 7ii’s compensation is exact.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1597\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Backpacking_Spring2022-29.jpg?fit=1200,1597&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Backpacking_Spring2022-29.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Backpacking_Spring2022-29.jpg?resize=1200,958&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Backpacking_Spring2022-29.jpg?resize=768,613&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Backpacking_Spring2022-29.jpg?resize=1536,1226&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1602\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/BackpackingCanyonlandsFilm-42.jpg?fit=1200,1602&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/BackpackingCanyonlandsFilm-42.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/BackpackingCanyonlandsFilm-42.jpg?resize=1200,961&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/BackpackingCanyonlandsFilm-42.jpg?resize=768,615&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/BackpackingCanyonlandsFilm-42.jpg?resize=1536,1230&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Canyons, Ektar 100, 2021, 2022</em></p>\n<p>What is nice about a rangefinder is you can open your left eye and see the entire scene, especially at 40 mm – 50 mm, the approximate focal length of the human eye.

The glass could slice paper; it is so sharp, it’s brutally honest.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1602\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/RecentRoll120_NYE22-59.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/RecentRoll120_NYE22-59.jpg?w=1602&amp;quality=75 1602w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/RecentRoll120_NYE22-59.jpg?resize=1200,1498&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/RecentRoll120_NYE22-59.jpg?resize=768,959&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/RecentRoll120_NYE22-59.jpg?resize=1230,1536&amp;quality=75 1230w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1602\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/RecentRoll120_NYE22-50.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/RecentRoll120_NYE22-50.jpg?w=1602&amp;quality=75 1602w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/RecentRoll120_NYE22-50.jpg?resize=1200,1498&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/RecentRoll120_NYE22-50.jpg?resize=768,959&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/RecentRoll120_NYE22-50.jpg?resize=1230,1536&amp;quality=75 1230w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1632\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/RecentRollSept-23.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/RecentRollSept-23.jpg?w=1632&amp;quality=75 1632w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/RecentRollSept-23.jpg?resize=1200,1471&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/RecentRollSept-23.jpg?resize=768,941&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/RecentRollSept-23.jpg?resize=1253,1536&amp;quality=75 1253w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Water Sign, Ektar 100, Portra 160, 2022, 2019</em></p>\n<p>My only qualm is with the shutter speed maxing out at 1/500th, so you’ve got to be selective with your ISO speed. Since I’m a desert rat, I usually shoot ISO 100 film exclusively in daylight scenarios, so this isn’t an issue for me, but it’s something to be mindful of if you like grainy negatives and higher-speed film.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, one’s journey with photography is a lot like one’s journey through bikes; trying various platforms before landing on that one “forever” specimen. For me, that was my Mamiya 7ii. I’ll never let it go, and when money gets tight, I’d rather sell a bike.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-2b.jpg?fit=1200,800&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-2b.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-2b.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-2b.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/Mamiya7ii-2b.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Exceptional camera</li>\n<li>Fast-focusing</li>\n<li>Varied lens focal lengths with razor-sharp glass</li>\n<li>Handheld at very slow speeds due to leaf shutter lenses</li>\n<li>6×7 negatives</li>\n<li>Ergonomically superior to others in its class</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Every time you bring it around <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/fuji-gw690ii-camera-review/\" target=\"_blank\">your friends</a>, they have to comment on it.</li>\n<li>1/500th shutter speed max</li>\n<li>If you ever lose or break it, a replacement will cost ya!</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/mamiya-7ii-review/\">Obscura: Sell the Bike, Keep the Camera – A Mamiya 7ii Review</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"5d072cccbd54ecddcc3b91bccf62b5778e44281103458e669e9ba9487404b7ac","category":"Cycling"}
