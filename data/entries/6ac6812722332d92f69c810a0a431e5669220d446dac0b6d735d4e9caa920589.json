Specifically, hardware to enable blood pressure measurements must \"meet requirements for water-resistance performance, further increasing the engineering and production challenges.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is widely rumored to be planning an all-digital event for the middle of next month, where the company is expected to announce the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> and Apple Watch Series 7. Today's report, however, citing sources, says those plans might be impacted due to the production issues. While production of the watch may be experiencing issues, those issues may only result in delayed shipping of the device rather than a delay in its announcement. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor example, Apple suppliers earlier this year were battling with production constraints related to mini-LED displays used in the new 12.9-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>. While the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> was announced in April, it didn't begin shipping until later in May due to production issues. A similar scenario may be in play with the Apple Watch Series 7 if today's report is true.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Update 9:42 am</b>: <em>Bloomberg</em> is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-31/apple-s-new-watch-will-likely-be-delayed-over-production-snags\">hearing similar information</a> that the launch is likely to be delayed.<blockquote>Apple Inc.â€™s upcoming smartwatch is suffering production snags as manufacturers adjust to a new design, likely leading to delays, according to a person familiar with the situation.</blockquote><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nikkei-com/\">nikkei.com</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/31/apple-watch-series-7-production-delay/\">Apple Watch Series 7 Production Reportedly Delayed Due to Quality Issues [Updated]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-7-production-reportedly-delayed-due-to-quality-issues-updated.2309302/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zHnjCe96Ocs:aBNqIkcQcmM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zHnjCe96Ocs:aBNqIkcQcmM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/zHnjCe96Ocs\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6ac6812722332d92f69c810a0a431e5669220d446dac0b6d735d4e9caa920589","category":"Apple"}
