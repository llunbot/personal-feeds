Today’s can save you big on a pair of excellent headphones from Apple (but not AirPods). Rather, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8PR4W22/\">Beats Studio Pro</a> is $170, a 51 percent discount, while the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZPLV566/\">Beats Solo 4</a> is down to $100, also half-off the MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We reviewed the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2323315/beats-solo-4-review.html\">Beats Solo 4</a> and gave them a 4-star review, loving the fact that they work so well with both iOS and Android devices. They have a great battery life, and they don’t just work over Bluetooth, but also via USB-C or 3.5mm, both of which enable you to listen to lossless audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We loved the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1999165/beats-studio-pro-review.html\">Beats Studio Pro</a> too, giving these a 4.5-star rating and also our Editors’ Choice award. Our tester appreciated how lightweight they are and the excellent battery life. These also allow you to experience audio via USB-C and 3.5mm, although you’re most likely going to rely on Bluetooth for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Even if they weren’t $200 cheaper, we’d recommend these over the AirPods Max. The lack of ear detection is a bummer, but Beats Studio Pro delivers better sound, battery life, controls, and compatibility, and they weigh a lot less, too,” our review reads, which is a big recommendation, especially considering how much we loved the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234986/airpods-max-review.html\">AirPods Max</a> (other than the price).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there you have it—if you want a pair of great headphones both the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8PR4W22/\">Beats Studio Pro</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZPLV566/\">Beats Solo 4</a> have fantastic prices right now.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZPLV566/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the Beats Solo 4 at Amazon</a></div>\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8PR4W22/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the Beats Studio Pro at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4d7b196dd744827e49989b9fdc3cadfde06ff484e96d658b183574671512e493","category":"Apple"}
