I get the pattern and structure of the torso and variations at the hems. But knitting on pockets is wild. And the arms at least have to be sewn onto the main body of the jersey, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, however they programmed the robotic weaving machines to knit together this jersey without seams, it’s a bold and intriguing evolution of the Classic merino-blend SportWool jersey that launched the iconic British cycling wear company back in 2004. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s still made of natural merino fibers blended with nylon &amp; lycra. It’s still classic black &amp; white with a relatively simple look featuring Rapha’s signature contrasting armband. Just, no pink accents here, though. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this feels like a much more technologically advanced jersey, even with its Classic origins and more traditional materials…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rapha new Classic Seamless Knit Jersey reinvents iconic kit</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Rapha-new-Classic-Seamless-Knit-Jersey-reinvented-merino-sportwool-road-bike-cycling-kit_in-profile-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Rapha-new-Classic-Seamless-Knit-Jersey-reinvented-merino-sportwool-road-bike-cycling-kit_in-profile-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Rapha new Classic Seamless Knit Jersey reinvented merino sportwool road bike cycling kit, side profile\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Rapha-new-Classic-Seamless-Knit-Jersey-reinvented-merino-sportwool-road-bike-cycling-kit_in-profile-jpg.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Rapha-new-Classic-Seamless-Knit-Jersey-reinvented-merino-sportwool-road-bike-cycling-kit_in-profile-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Rapha-new-Classic-Seamless-Knit-Jersey-reinvented-merino-sportwool-road-bike-cycling-kit_in-profile-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Rapha-new-Classic-Seamless-Knit-Jersey-reinvented-merino-sportwool-road-bike-cycling-kit_in-profile-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Rapha-new-Classic-Seamless-Knit-Jersey-reinvented-merino-sportwool-road-bike-cycling-kit_in-profile-768x461.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Rapha-new-Classic-Seamless-Knit-Jersey-reinvented-merino-sportwool-road-bike-cycling-kit_in-profile-2048x1229.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos/Rapha)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Created to mark 20 years of Rapha, we’re proud to release the Classic Seamless Knit, inspired by Rapha’s first and most iconic piece – the Classic Jersey, which debuted in 2004.
