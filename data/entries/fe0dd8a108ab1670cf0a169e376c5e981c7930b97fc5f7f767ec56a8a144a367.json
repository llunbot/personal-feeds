It’s thinner than other Magic keyboards, and there’s even a function row to allow you to quickly control volume, brightness, or media, just like you would on a laptop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new trackpad is also larger and comes with haptic feedback. It also supports various Multi-Touch gestures, enabling you to scroll, swipe, or zoom. Another nice touch is that the keys are backlit, making them easier to see when you’re using the tablet in the evening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know the iPad Pro M4 is rather pricey, but it does deliver a fantastic performance thanks to the new chip and all the other upgrades Apple delivered. It’s so good that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369843/m4-ipad-pro-1tb-review.html\">we gave it a super-rare 5-star rating</a>.
