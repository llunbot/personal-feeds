Netflix Games are downloaded to your Android device, as opposed to being streamed from Netflix's cloud servers. (Subscription services like Nvidia GeForce Now, Xbox Game Streaming, and Amazon Luna remain poised to vie for the \"Netflix of gaming\" crown by streaming computationally intense games from server farms to your favorite screen.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809727#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809727&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"18fb1cae83664baaa538d53d13a7cd9381f9e9903936ef71d3c95fd56d56f39f","category":"Tech"}
