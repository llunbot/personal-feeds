{"title":"Hanlon’s Razor Meets Its Match: Twitter/X","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/15/twitter-x-links-delayed/","date":1692128919000,"content":"\n<p>Jeremy B. Merrill and Drew Harwell, reporting for The Washington Post:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The company formerly known as Twitter has begun slowing the speed\nwith which users can access links to the New York Times, Facebook\nand other news organizations and online competitors, a move that\nappears targeted at companies that have drawn the ire of owner\nElon Musk. [...] The delayed websites included X’s online rivals\nFacebook, Instagram, Bluesky and Substack, as well as the Reuters\nwire service and the Times. All of them have previously been\nsingled out by Musk for ridicule or attack.</p>\n\n<p>The delay affects the t.co domain, a link-shortening service that\nX uses to process every link posted to the website. Traffic is\nrouted through the middleman service, allowing X to track — and\nin this case throttle — activity to the target website,\npotentially taking away traffic and ad revenue from businesses\nMusk personally dislikes.</p>\n\n<p>The Post’s analysis found that links to most other sites were\nunaffected — including those to The Washington Post, Fox News and\nsocial media services such as Mastodon and YouTube — with the\nshortened links being routed to their final destination in a\nsecond or less. A user <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37130060\">first flagged</a> the delays early Tuesday on\nthe technology discussion forum Hacker News.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37130060\">The Hacker News thread</a> has the sort of nerdery you’d expect, including the fact that you won’t see the delay when using <code>curl</code> with its default user-agent string, because <code>curl</code> is special-cased by t.co.</p>\n\n<p>Hanlon’s Razor — “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity” — is a remarkably accurate rule of thumb. But in the case of Twitter/X, it’s not helpful: the stupidity behind the company’s poorly run services is matched by the spitefulness of its owner. Purposeful spite and inadvertent bug strike me as equally likely here, and the list of domain that suffer this delay really does look like Musk’s shitlist. But regardless of the cause, the effect is undeniably bad for users: click or tap a link to these popular sites from Twitter, and it takes about 5 seconds for the URL to resolve.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/15/hanlons-x\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9085c45471b6d3d758c2175d56e6ccd2cf8834600abbf93c5bf82db8c818eded","category":"Tech"}
