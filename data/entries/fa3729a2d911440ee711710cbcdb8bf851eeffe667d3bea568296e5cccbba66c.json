The <a href=\"https://casetext.com/statute/colorado-revised-statutes/title-29-government-local/competition-in-utility-and-entertainment-services/article-27-competition-in-utility-and-entertainment-services/part-2-conditions-for-providing-services/section-29-27-201-vote-referendum\">2005 law</a> required local governments to hold an election before offering cable television or telecommunications service, a process that pitted city and town leaders against well-funded broadband industry lobbying campaigns.</p>\n<p>Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, <a href=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb23-183\">signed a bill</a> to eliminate that law yesterday. The bill had been approved by the State House in a 48-14 vote and in the Senate by a 31-4 vote. Both chambers have Democratic majorities, but the votes didn't go entirely along party lines; all of the \"no\" votes came from Republicans, but other Republicans joined Democrats in approving the bill.</p>\n<p>The bill signed by Polis \"gives local governments the authority to provide broadband service, either on their own or by partnering with industry service providers, without holding a local election,\" the Governor's Office of Information Technology <a href=\"https://oit.colorado.gov/press-release/governor-polis-signs-bipartisan-senate-bill-23-183-removing-the-biggest-barrier-to\">said</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936108#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936108&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fa3729a2d911440ee711710cbcdb8bf851eeffe667d3bea568296e5cccbba66c","category":"Tech"}
