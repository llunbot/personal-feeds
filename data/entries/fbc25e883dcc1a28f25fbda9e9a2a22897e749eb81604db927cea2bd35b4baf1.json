When asked if he told her to hold out for the iPhone 15, Cook laughed. \"I didn't exactly say that.\"   \r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can watch the full interview above or view it on YouTube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-FBYmIhRoo\">here</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cbs/\">CBS</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/tim-cook-watched-ted-lasso-apple-vision-pro/\">Tim Cook Watched Entire Third Season of 'Ted Lasso' on Apple Vision Pro, Which Remains on Track for Early 2024</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tim-cook-watched-entire-third-season-of-ted-lasso-on-apple-vision-pro-which-remains-on-track-for-early-2024.2402826/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fbc25e883dcc1a28f25fbda9e9a2a22897e749eb81604db927cea2bd35b4baf1","category":"Apple"}
