Every part explained in simple terms</a></p>\n\n<p>A road bike is a bicycle designed primarily for riding quickly on paved surfaces. Road bikes have drop handlebars, fairly narrow slick tyres and usually place the rider in a position where their bum is higher than their hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The average road bike comprises component parts that haven’t changed all that much in over a century. However, if you haven’t used that time to acquaint yourself with the correct terminology, we won’t hold it against you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below we’ve broken down the typical road bike into its constituent parts. Once you’ve read this, you’ll be able to walk into any bike shop and confidently identify each bit of the bike along with what it does.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-gravel-bike\">What is a gravel bike?

More affordable road bike frames will be made of aluminium or, if you spend a little more, carbon fibre. Older or more niche models can also be made of steel, while some boutique frames are made of titanium. Even bikes with metal frames often have forks made partly or fully from carbon fibre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever it’s composed of, it will accomplish the same job, namely supporting the rider and allowing for the attachment of the other components. Frames come in different sizes to match their rider. As these get larger or smaller, both the height and length of the frame change to fit the riders’s legs and upper body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accommodating all the other parts of the bike, the frame and fork will determine the maximum size tyres a bike can accept, whether it uses conventional <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/rim-brakes-a-buyers-guide\" target=\"_blank\">rim brakes</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-cyclist-guide-to-road-bike-disc-brakes\" target=\"_blank\">disc brakes</a> and if it can take accessories such as <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-bicycle-mudguards\" target=\"_blank\">mudguards</a> (fenders), <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/buyers-guide-the-best-bicycle-panniers\" target=\"_blank\">pannier</a> racks or <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-bikepacking-bags\" target=\"_blank\">bikepacking bags</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dimensions and angles of the frame and fork – or geometry – also help determine the handling characteristics of the complete bicycle.

Most <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-wheel-upgrades\" target=\"_blank\">road bike wheels</a> are ‘700c’, denoting a specific diameter. Smaller bikes or those for children may use different, more diminutive sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Affordable and mid-range bike wheels have aluminium (‘alloy’) rims, while more expensive models get carbon rims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rims are laced to hubs using spokes commonly made from steel, but sometimes aluminium or even carbon. The rear hub on modern road bikes incorporates a freewheeling mechanism knows as a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-freehub\" target=\"_blank\">freehub</a>, onto which the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cassette\" target=\"_blank\">cassette</a> (see below) mounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to those on other styles of bicycle, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-cycling-tyres-the-best-tyres-for-all-occasions\" target=\"_blank\">road bike tyres</a> are narrow, without a pronounced tread pattern, ie, near-slick.

The size of the chainrings attached then combines with the cassette to make efficient use of your pedalling efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, road bike cranksets have two chainrings with 53 and 39 teeth (or ‘t’), respectively. However, to provide easier gears, it’s now common to find a combination of 50 and 36. Formerly the norm, a combination of 53/39 chainrings is referred to as a ‘standard double’ crankset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 50/34 combination is <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/dear-frank-compact-chainsets\" target=\"_blank\">‘compact’</a>, while in between the two, a ‘pro-compact’ chainset uses 52 and 36-tooth chainrings and offers performance somewhere in the middle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The newest SRAM 12-speed road groupsets offer crank ratios of 50/37, 48/35 and 46/33.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some touring-style road bikes will also have a third chainring. Called a ‘triple’, this provides a vast range of gears and is helpful for very hilly terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also increasingly common are <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/are-1x-groupsets-the-future-for-road-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">single chainring cranksets</a>. Referred to as 1× or ‘one-by’, these use a single chainring, do away with the need for a front derailleur and offer a simplified range of sequential gears.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paired to a wide cassette, they give a similar spread of gears but with more significant jumps between each. They’re particularly popular on mixed-terrain <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/?p=5950\" target=\"_blank\">gravel bikes</a>, although they do occasionally feature on road bikes too. Also largely the preserve of gravel bikes are ‘super-compact’ double cranksets with ratios such as 48/31, 46/33, 46/30 and 43/30.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bearing assembly in the frame that the crankset rides on is called the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/bottom-bracket-standards\" target=\"_blank\">bottom bracket</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Road bike cassette</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/04/03011256/specialized-sworks-aethos-9-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cassette on road bike\" /><figcaption>Matthew Loveridge / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The cassette is the cluster of cogs attached to the rear wheel. Driven by the chain, they convert your pedalling efforts into forward momentum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference in size between the cog on the cassette and the chainring affects how easy it is to turn the pedals. Currently, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/campagnolo-ekar-13-speed-1x-gravel-groupset\" target=\"_blank\">the maximum number of sprockets on any cassette is 13</a>. However, 11 and 12-speed cassettes are more common. Cheaper or older bikes might have drastically fewer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having lots of sprockets is good because it lets you <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-cyclist-guide-to-the-right-gear-ratios-for-climbing\" target=\"_blank\">pedal efficiently regardless of the terrain</a>. However, just as crucial as having many individual gears is having a wide range of them. A cassette with a big difference between the largest and smallest sprocket is referred to as having a ‘wide ratio’. This means it’ll be well suited to both riding very fast and crawling along very slowly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cassette ratio is expressed as a range of tooth counts and modern road bikes typically come with 11-28, 11-30, 11-32 or 10-33 cassettes, although there are numerous other options.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cassette\" target=\"_blank\">What cassette do I need?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\">Bicycle gear ratios explained</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Road bike chain</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02132149/bicycle_chain_03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Bike chain\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02132149/bicycle_chain_03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02132149/bicycle_chain_03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02132149/bicycle_chain_03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02132149/bicycle_chain_03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02132149/bicycle_chain_03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02132149/bicycle_chain_03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02132149/bicycle_chain_03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02132149/bicycle_chain_03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/a-buyers-guide-to-bike-chains\" target=\"_blank\">road bike chain</a> is an assemblage of links, rollers, and rivets that connects the cranks to the cassette.
