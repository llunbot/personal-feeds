In 2017 we decided to buy a travel trailer so we could widen our experience and travel in comfort. We pick a destination then find places in between to stay and bike. We have found some great hidden gems this way. On our way to Whitefish, MT, we stopped in Sturgis, SD, for a couple of days of riding. These were some fun trails. I took a day to ride solo and decided to investigate the <a href=\"https://gfp.sd.gov/userdocs/centennial-trail-brochure.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Centennial 89 North trail</a>. What a unique ride! I loved it! Two challenging climbs, since I did an out and back, and great views. I love when you can’t even tell where the trail is out in the prairie. It’s not the traditional definition of mtb to most, and that’s also what I enjoyed about it. The best part? I had the whole ride to myself, not another person in sight. This would be a great lunch ride: pack a lunch and take a break at Bear Butte Lake and then work it all off on the return.”</p><p>We always love seeing photos from where you are riding and are happy to share them with our readers around&nbsp;the world here on the Pic Of The Day.
