There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we're going to take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder.</em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Good morning. It's March 5, and today's image comes from the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>\n<p>It's a new deep-field image from the infrared space telescope, showcasing a portion of the \"Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey\" region of space that has previously been observed by other space telescopes, including Hubble and Chandra. Almost everything in this image that doesn't have lines emanating from it is a galaxy.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007752#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007752&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"54d0d8f28b2ade660bdecebd68b2352d948309f88ef8cf214c3dcb0890482454","category":"Tech"}
