You just need an Android phone and a compatible car; plug the two together, and the interface starts up. (I like to think of this system as being similar to a desktop PC. The phone is the PC tower and does software and computing, and the car is the monitor.) Android Auto is not going anywhere.<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788797#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788797&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cc072d5a3b31ed2e12e08189b985c92ca7d74a4c29f43666b7621608e4468554","category":"Tech"}
