T-Mobile's new \"Home Internet Backup,\" <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/home-internet-backup\">announced</a> today, is intended to be used only when a user's primary home Internet service goes down.</p>\n<p>One big drawback is that T-Mobile clearly intends for customers to subscribe to the $30 monthly plan indefinitely, even though a user likely wouldn't need it during some months and might need it for just a day or two in other months. The pricing terms make it so that canceling and resubscribing as needed is not feasible.</p>\n<p>T-Mobile said the plan provides 130GB of 5G data each month, \"enough to keep a typical household connected with Wi-Fi for up to seven days a month when their primary internet service goes down.\" After 130GB, speeds will be reduced to \"up to\" 600kbps.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029297#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029297&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"74cba31f1cd141a4238632bed2a6f725073a8782a4f0d6d249e8323e89029ed2","category":"Tech"}
