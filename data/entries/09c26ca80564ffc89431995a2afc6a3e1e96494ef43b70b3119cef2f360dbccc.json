Ever since iOS 17 arrived in September, BMW drivers have reported an issue with the in-car wireless charging that disables iPhone’s NFC chip and zaps the ability to use Apple Pay and digital car keys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As iPhone issues go, it’s a relatively small one, affecting only the newest phones and just two car types: BMW and Toyota Supra models. However, according to an internal memo seen by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-to-fix-iphone-15-bmw-charging-issue/&amp;xcust=1-1-2117398-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">MacRumors</a>, Apple is aware of the issue and working on a fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple says the issue will be addressed in a software update later this year, but until then, affected users are advised to visit an Apple Store or an authorized service technician to repair the device either by restarting the NFC chip with the Apple Service Toolkit 2 or replacing the damaged chip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a temporary workaround, Apple advises users with these car models to avoid using wireless charging in their cars. </p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"09c26ca80564ffc89431995a2afc6a3e1e96494ef43b70b3119cef2f360dbccc","category":"Apple"}
