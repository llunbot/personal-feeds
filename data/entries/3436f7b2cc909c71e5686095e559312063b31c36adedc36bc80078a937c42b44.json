That’s a $89 discount off its $349 MSRP, and just $10 off its Black Friday all-time-low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple launched the new iPad just a couple of fays ago, but it doesn’t really bring enough to the table for us to immediately recommend it over the iPad 10th gen, especially before we start seeing any kind of discounts. It has a new A16 chip that’s a little faster and that’s it. Even the colors are the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main differences between the 10th gen iPad and the new model are the processor (A14 vs A16) and of storage space (64GB vs 128GB). However, 128GB should be plenty for a bunch of apps and games and watching Netflix on your couch on the 10.9-inch screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1371039/ipad-10th-generation-review.html\">we reviewed the 10th-gen iPad</a>, we appreciated the improved cameras which will come in handy if you have to join any video calls for work, as well as the beautiful design. And if you want more of a laptop experience, you can get the Magic Keyboard Folio (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLFH8RC\">on sale for $50 off</a>) for more efficiency when you’re trying to squeeze some work in while on your tablet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t wait for the new iPad (A16) and grab this amazing deal for the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLCWFNM\">iPad 10th gen while it’s still available for $269 at Amazon</a>.</p>\n\n\n<span>Save $90 on a new iPad</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLCWFNM\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3436f7b2cc909c71e5686095e559312063b31c36adedc36bc80078a937c42b44","category":"Apple"}
