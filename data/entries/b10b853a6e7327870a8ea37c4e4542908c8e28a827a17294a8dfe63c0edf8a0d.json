Then what type of bikes and how many bikes you need to carry. Which vehicle – or vehicles – do you have, and will you be taking a mixture of bikes? Are they heavy, do they have thru-axles, and will they be getting dirty?</p>\n<p>The next question is how do you want to carry the bikes? On top of the vehicle? Off the back? Does your vehicle have a receiver hitch? Bike’s front wheel on or off? Another thing to consider is if you want or need to carry other sporting equipment.</p>\n<p>Bikes vary widely in cost, style, size and weight too, all of which should be factors when looking for a means of transporting them. You probably won’t want to risk carrying your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes/\">road bike</a> on a rack that costs less than one of its ultra-light tyres.</p>\n<p>Also consider practicality: whether the rack will suit your needs now and in the future; ease of use – how easy it is to fit to the vehicle and load; security – whether it holds the bikes safely and locks the bikes to the rack and the vehicle; and how much storage space it will take up when not in use.</p>\n<p>The main types of bike rack are <strong>roof-mounted, </strong><strong>boot</strong> or <strong>trunk-</strong><strong>mounted </strong>and <strong>towbar or hitch-mounted</strong>. Plus there are options for truck beds and speciality racks for unique situations.</p>\n<h2>Roof-mounted bike racks</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"droprack on roof\" title=\"droprack on roof\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A T-bolt attachment is compatible with the the most common bike racks.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Most roof racks consist of feet that attach to your vehicle’s roof, and cross bars to which the accessories attach. Bike racks for roof racks vary between ones that require front-wheel removal and racks that allow both wheels to remain on the bike.</p>\n<p>Front-wheel removal keeps the bike lower (great for tall SUVs), can be easier and lighter to load, and is the classic way of hauling bikes up-top.</p>\n<p>Bike racks that keep both wheels on the bike are taller, generally cost more, and can be less stable. However, they avoid frequent wheel removal and re-installation.</p>\n<p>Either option often includes integrated locks to secure your bike to the rack. And, of course, the rack is locked to the bars, and the bars are locked to your vehicle.</p>\n<p>There are simpler roof-mounted bike racks available that don’t require a dedicated base bar setup, such as the <a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/us/mtb/gear/category/accessories/car-racks/product/review-seasucker-talon-49935/\">SeaSucker rack</a> (below), which uses suction cups to attach to your car. There are also roof-mounted bike racks that attach to your vehicle’s factory-installed roof rack.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Roof-mounted bike rack\" title=\"5rack-buyers_guide-1471474881587-1wqk1f3p1g6b3-21faee7\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Roof-mounted bike racks can be simple and much less involved.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Sea Sucker</i></span></div>\n<p>While not permanent, roof racks generally stay on your vehicle all the time because they are hugely versatile – being able to add and remove sport-specific accessories enables you to carry bikes, kayaks, skis, SUP boards, cargo boxes, etc.</p>\n<p>Basically, any big, bulky item is fair game for a roof rack, even ladders, lumber and other non-sport items.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Roof racks can be used for a huge variety of gear-hauling duties\" title=\"4rack-buyers_guide-1471474881583-zi7byj7fr7dt-b6c7312\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Roof racks can be used for a huge variety of gear-hauling duties.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Yakima</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Pros:</strong> Super-versatile for all kinds of gear hauling; one of the most secure rack types available; doesn’t hinder access to any doors/boot/hatch/tailgate</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Drive under something low if you’ve forgotten about your bikes and you could wreck them and damage your vehicle; you’re also adding aero drag to your vehicle, so fuel consumption will likely increase</li>\n</ul><h3>Thule ProRide 598</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Whether its road, mountain or a fat bike, the 598 should be able to take it.

It may sound unlikely, but each 15.24cm / 6in suction cup produces up to 210lbs of pull strength, and there are six cups – it’s rock solid.</p>\n<p>Like other roof-rack bike carriers, the Mini Bomber rack holds bikes through their front fork. SeaSucker offers a range of accessories to work with whatever axle your front wheel uses.</p>\n<p>Back to the suction cups, the SeaSucker can be mounted to all sorts of vehicles and in a variety of ways: on the roof, half on the rear-hatch glass, half on the trunk. The options are numerous.</p>\n<p>Another highlight of the Mini Bomber is its small size. When it’s not needed, it can easily be stashed in most cars.</p>\n<p>While SeaSucker does offer a lock and cable for security, it’s not as elegant as some of the other racks’ built-in solutions.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/us/road/gear/category/accessories/car-racks/product/seasucker-mini-bomber-roof-rack-review-51849/\">Read our full SeaSucker Mini Bomber review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>SeaSucker Talon</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Seasucker's Talon roof rack holds tight to your car\" title=\"1446578355053-1xdza6gp1t466-30e29fd\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Seasucker’s Talon roof holds a single bike and attaches to your car using suction cups.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£329.99 / $299 / AU$499</li>\n<li>Holds one bike</li>\n<li>45lbs / 20kg maximum load</li>\n<li>Fork-mount bike attachment</li>\n</ul><p>Much like the Mini Bomber, the Talon attaches to your car using suction cups.

The main thing holding them to your vehicle is a bunch of straps that hook around the lip of your vehicle’s trunk/hatchback/bumper.</p>\n<p>Such racks are usually highly adjustable, so you can fit them to the rear of almost any vehicle.

They’re usually more expensive than other bike rack styles, but the ease of loading and unloading bikes, and not having to lift them onto the vehicle’s roof makes them a popular option.</p>\n<p>Most feature locks that secure the bike to the rack and the rack to the vehicle. Clever designs enable almost one-handed fitting, while hinged load sections provide access to the boot/tailgate of the vehicle without having to remove the bikes.</p>\n<p>As a basic rule, the more features a rack has, such as built-in locks, repair stands, lightweight materials, etc, the more it costs. You also need a towbar/hitch on your vehicle, which can be an extra expense if you don’t already have one, and some vehicles are only compatible with 1 1/4in hitches, which typically limit the rack to two bikes instead of four or five bikes, as with a 2in hitch.</p>\n<p>Hitch-mounted racks most commonly hold bikes by their wheels, with an arm securing the front wheel (as shown above) or by hanging from their top tubes (image below).</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Hitch-mounted racks can carry from one to five bikes\" title=\"2rack-buyers_guide-1471474881571-6jwt4jnix37-1186839\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Hitch-mounted racks can carry from one to five bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Yakima</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Pros:</strong> Good ones are strong, and because they’re behind the vehicle and out of the way of the main airflow, fuel consumption doesn’t suffer too much; loading and unloading bikes is super-simple; security can be very good</li>\n<li><strong>Cons: </strong>You need a towbar or hitch; with the bikes off, reversing can yield some rather horrifying results if you forget about the rack; may necessitate an accessory number plate in some territories</li>\n</ul><p><em>A note for our Australian readers: if your hitch-mount rack obscures the view of your number plate, you’ll also need an illuminated accessory number plate.

The SplitRail has one of the best, it’s easy to access and works well too.</p>\n<p>Loading bikes is, of course, another primary concern. The SplitRail helps with this task by using tabs that keep the rear-wheel straps out of the way. It sounds minor, but in use it’s brilliant.</p>\n<p>The rack hauls nearly every wheel size, from small to large, skinny to mid-fat, but full-on fat bikes aren’t compatible, says RockyMounts.</p>\n<p>Even storage off the vehicle is handled smartly. The SplitRail comes with a wall-mounted rack holder that keeps the rack off the floor and tucked closely against the wall.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/us/mtb/gear/category/accessories/car-racks/product/rockymounts-splitrail-rack-50533/\">R</a><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/us/mtb/gear/category/accessories/car-racks/product/rockymounts-splitrail-rack-50533/\">ead our full RockyMounts SplitRail review</a></li>\n</ul><h3>Thule VeloCompact 927 towbar rack</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The Thule VeloCompact 927 fits onto a standard towball and is designed to carry three bikes\" title=\"1443503975890-10e59zf9yz0am-94e7b6d\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Thule VeloCompact 927 fits onto a standard towball and is designed to carry three bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Rome / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£600 / AU$1,250 / €699.95</li>\n<li>Holds three bikes, or four with an additional holder available as an extra</li>\n<li>Bikes attach using wheel straps, plus arms that hold them upright</li>\n<li>Foot-pedal tilt for easy boot/trunk access</li>\n<li>Maximum load of 60kg</li>\n</ul><p>Thule’s premium towbar-mount rear rack takes three bikes and has the option to add a holder for a fourth.
