The route then heads to the Pyrenees in the west of the Alps, through the Massif Central to the Jura and Vosges mountains in the east of France, before the iconic processional ride into Paris and sprint finish on the Champs-Élysées. <br /><br />This edition is a climber’s paradise with eight mountain stages, boasting a record-breaking 30 climbs and only one time trial. But who will be able to climb their way to the top of the podium after 21 days of racing?</p>\n\n<p><em><span>Odds correct at time of publishing</span></em></p>\n<h3>Jonas Vingegaard - 5/4</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/ZW-04614_25bbf8d8-8d68-465a-8796-bcf6bc6bef74.jpg?v=1685707195\" alt=\"Jonas Vingegaard\" /><em>Jonas Vingegaard won last year's Tour de France (Image by SWPix.com)</em></p>\n<p>After winning the Tour last year, Jonas Vingegaard is back looking to defend his title and starts the race as favourite according to the bookmakers. While this year’s Tour has one less time trial than last year’s edition, the Dane has more than enough ability to make up for this in the mountains, and his Jumbo-Visma squad, including Wout van Aert, Christophe Laporte, Dylan van Baarle, and super mountain domestique, Sepp Kuss, will surely be one of the strongest of the Tour.</p>\n<p>It’s been a three-year battle between Vingegaard and Tadej Pogačar at the Tour. Vingegaard placed second in 2021, then trumped Pogačar last year after cracking him the Alps. Both riders will have their eyes firmly on winning another Tour title – so this year will be another Pogačar vs Vingegaard show.</p>\n<p>The two have come head-to-head already this season at Paris-Nice, but Vingegaard was comprehensively beaten by Pogačar and missed out on second place to David Gauda. However, at the Itzulia Basque Country, he came back with a vengeance to win three out of six stages and a clear overall victory.</p>\n<p>Pogačar's injury (see more below) may be a key motivation for the bookies to make Vingegaard the narrow favourite, but judging by the odds on offer, there's almost nothing to separate them.</p>\n<h3>Tadej Pogačar  - 6/4</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stg07_pogacar_peloton02_paris-nice_2023.jpg?v=1686050552\" alt=\"Tadej Pogacar\" /><em>Tadej Pogačar at this year's Paris-Nice (Image by James Startt)</em></p>\n<p>A two-time Tour de France winner, Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates) will be going into this year’s Tour as many people's firm favourite. At the time of publishing however, Pogačar remains behind his main rival Vingegaard in the bookmakers' opinion.</p>\n<p>The 24-year-old had consistently proved he is a force to be reckoned with at the Tour, coming first on his debut in 2021 and then defending his title the year after. Only last year did someone put an end to his reign, with Vingegaard taking the yellow jersey from the Slovenian in the mountains of stage 11.</p>\n<p>Pogačar has already had a glittering career, continually adding the most prestigious of race titles to his palmarés. This theme continued in this year’s Classics season, where he absolutely dominated, taking first place at the Tour of Flanders, Amstel Gold Race and La Flèche Wallonne. So far this year, he has only missed out on one podium spot at Milan-Sanremo, where he placed fourth. But when it looked like nothing could stop his run, an unfortunate crash at Liège-Bastogne-Liège left him with a fractured wrist and prevented him from securing the Ardennes treble as well as putting an abrupt pause on his 2023 racing season. That may be why he's currently trailing Vingegaard in the odds. </p>\n<p>However, Pogačar is on the mend and has his sights set firmly on July, documenting his rehab sessions and gruelling kitchen roller rides on Instagram. Back on the roads in late May, he joined the rest of the team at a camp at altitude in preparation for the Tour. Unlike last year, where we caught a glimpse of his form ahead of the Tour at the Tour of Slovenia, this year, we will really first see how he has recovered from his injury once the Tour has begun, only racing the Slovenian National Championships beforehand.<br /><br />This year’s route will suit him well with mountain after mountain. There is also a 22.4km individual time trial on stage 16, where he could boost his chances, although there is very little between he and Vingegaard against the clock.</p>\n<p>A man for making the unbelievable happen, even an injured Pogačar is a strong favourite to win the Tour de France.</p>\n<h3>Jai Hindley - 25/1</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1399022749_87f29409-46b0-405f-ad38-553fe2739d2f.jpg?v=1686055352\" alt=\"Jai Hindley\" /><em>Jai Hindley won the Giro d'Italia last year after taking the pink jersey from Richard Carapaz (Image by Getty Images)</em></p>\n<p>After winning the <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/giro-ditalia\">Giro d’Italia</a> last year, Jai Hindley is making his debut at the Tour de France, stating he preferred the route at the Tour, which focused on mountain stages rather than the time trials which dominated this year’s Giro. Having raced the Giro four times and the <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/vuelta-a-espana\">Vuelta a España</a> twice, Hindley’s racing season has had to alter slightly to ensure he is in peak shape for July. His last race was in April at Liège-Bastogne-Liège, placing 83rd, and from there, Hindley went to altitude like many of his other rivals. In a final race before the Tour, he is now in France to race the Critérium du Dauphiné, where he’ll hope to see how he compares to some of those he'll face at the Tour.</p>\n<p>His results in other one-week stage races and one-day Classics don’t often reflect how the Australian rider will perform in a Grand Tour. Even when he won the Giro last year, he’d achieved mediocre results in the lead-up. So, while, on paper, his season has looked a little lacklustre, Hindley remains the bookies' favourite outside of Vingegaard and Pogačar. </p>\n<h3>Enric Mas - 28/1</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1420781912_1024x1024.jpg?v=1669656309\" /></p>\n<p><em>Mas has proved a much more potent threat at the Vuelta than at the Tour so far (Getty Images)</em></p>\n<p>Enric Mas (Movistar) has had consistently good results in both the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, having placed second twice in the Spanish Grand Tour and fifth and sixth at the Tour. The Spaniard has continued this consistency through to this year, where he has achieved top-10 finishes in the three stage races he has completed, but was unable to get close to Vingegaard when he faced him at Itzulia Basque Country.</p>\n<p>Despite his relative success of placing highly in stage races, Mas has lacked the winning punch that's been needed to convert his efforts into victories, putting him in the shadows of first place. Nonetheless, he should thrive on the difficult climbing parcours of the Tour, so we'd expect to see him in the top 10 and possibly even on the podium if things go well. Whether he'll make the top spot, we're unsure, and the bookies seem to agree.</p>\n<h3>Richard Carapaz - 33/1</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1476549413.jpg?v=1686055665\" alt=\"Richard Carapaz\" /><em>Richard Carapaz at this year's Volta Ciclista a Catalunya (Image by Getty Images)</em></p>\n<p>Richard Carapaz’s first season with EF Education-EasyPost will see him as the GC contender for the American team at the Tour. The 30-year-old rider has had plenty of experience as a successful GC rider having won the Giro in 2019 and placed third at the Tour in 2021 behind Pogačar and Vingegaard,</p>\n<p>A punchy and attacking climber, over the course of his career he's only finished outside the top-five in four of the nine Grand Tours he's finished. However, despite being the 2022 Ecuadorian ITT national champion, his time trial results have varied during Grand Tours. He will need to make sure he puts in one of his strongest performances to ensure he does not lose lots of time to the two favourites.</p>\n<p>Having spent a lot of time at a training camp in the Pyrenees, Carapaz hasn’t had the best results in comparison to the likes of Pogačar and Vingegaard, and has only secured a victory at the Mercan’Tour Classic Alpes-Maritimes against a field not at the same level as he will encounter at the Tour. </p>\n<p>His lack of racing may explain why he's not at shorter odds right now, but a week at the Dauphiné could see him placed higher. </p>\n\n<h3><strong>David Gaudu - 40/1</strong></h3>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/06_gaudu_alaphilippe02_classic_2023_cfd4e5d0-82fe-49da-9619-070990041ba4.jpg?v=1686126142\" alt=\"David Gaudu\" /></div>\n<p><em>David Gaudu was in excellent form at Paris-Nice this year (Image by James Startt)</em></p>\n<p>David Gaudu (Groupama-FDJ) will be looking to make his mark on this year's Tour de France after missing out on a podium spot last year, finishing 13-39 minutes behind the winner Vingegaard. This year will be his fifth appearance at the Tour, and he'll hope that this will be the edition he can crack the podium or at least nab a stage victory – something he is yet to achieve in his home race.</p>\n<p>He has been the only rider to really challenge the big two so far this year. Finishing second behind Pogačar at Paris-Nice, the Frenchman managed to rumble Vingegaard, putting him in third place at 46 seconds behind. However, the Dane was unstoppable at the Itzulia Basque Country, and Gaudu could only finish with a fourth-place finish, 1-31 behind Vingegaard.</p>\n<p>An unsuccessful Ardennes Classics campaign – not finishing any of the three races – might explain why he's at longer odds in spite of his Paris-Nice performance. Gaudu is more at home in stage races compared to the big one-day Classics though, and motivation to podium in his country's biggest race should make him a feature of the GC battle in the mountains.</p>\n<p>If he can come into the Tour de France with the same form he found at Paris-Nice, he'll be a rider the other favourites will have to keep a close eye on.</p>\n<h3>Ben O'Connor - 75/1</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1401506262.jpg?v=1655715644\" /></p>\n<p><em>O'Connor will be looking to rectify a difficult 2022 Tour in which he was forced to abandon (Getty Images)</em></p>\n<p>A stage winner in both the Tour de France and the Giro d'Italia, Ben O'Connor's GC aspirations have perhaps not matched his stage winning ability at Grand Tours, hence why AG2R Citroën man is considered a long-shot by the bookies.</p>\n<p>He valiantly finished best of the rest in 2021 as he sealed fourth overall, three minutes off the podium, while an eighth place at the Vuelta 2022 is best GC result since. The Australian talked up his ambitions last year before an early crash spoiled his ambitions, but at his very best he certainly has what it takes to be in the mix for the overall podium. It just looks like a reach too far for him to deny either Pogačar or Vingegaard the overall win if they remain in the race.</p>\n<h3>Mikel Landa - 80/1</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1475085140_9f1aaeef-7e97-4e72-a26a-ac2d6177346a.jpg?v=1686128071\" alt=\"Mikel Landa\" /><em>Mikel Landa will be one of the more experienced GC riders going into the Tour this year (Image by Getty Images)</em></p>\n<p>Mikel Landa (Bahrain-Victorious) has looked in sterling form this year, and his second place behind Jonas Vingegaard at Itzulia Basque Country was a demonstration of that.</p>\n<p>Yet the Spaniard continues to have never won a WorldTour stage race overall and has yet to crack the podium at the Tour. He placed fourth in 2020 and (very narrowly) in 2017 but has lacked the winning formula, which will be why he remains a real outsider despite being remarkably consistent.</p>\n<p>This year's route starts in Landa's home region of the Basque Country, so we could expect to see him active from the very off, and he'll be supported by a strong team that includes Fred Wright, Matej Mohorič, Pello Bilbao and Wout Poels.</p>\n<p>The 30-year-old will no doubt continue to inexplicably attack at inopportune moments, but it still feels like an outside shot that he'll be able to turn a top-10 into a win at this year's Tour.</p>\n<h3>Other favourites</h3>\n<p><strong>Romain Bardet</strong> (Team DSM) has flown under the radar somewhat this year, but seems determined to have another crack at the Tour. At <strong>100/1</strong> he's considered a real long shot, but a strong display at the Tour de Suisse could propel him up the favourites list.</p>\n<p><strong>Adam Yates </strong>is at <strong>66/1</strong> and rightly so considering his strong start to life at UAE Team Emirates. But considering he's on the same team as Pogačar, it seems unlikely he'll get his chance unless their main man can't finish. Adam's brother Simon remains at <strong>80/1 </strong>despite not racing since abandoning the Tour de Romandie in April, but the Jayco-Alula rider's form remains a mystery.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stg06_bardet_paris-nice_2023_b1bbaed2-7162-4359-981e-c19898d2c749.jpg?v=1686127019\" alt=\"Romain Bardet\" /><br /><em>Romain Bardet will be going into his 10th Tour de France this year (Image by James Startt)</em></p>\n<p>Ineos Grenadiers will most likely have <strong>Daniel Martínez</strong> as the team’s leader, but the Colombian is considered a real challenger for victory at <strong>80/1</strong>. He even trails behind his team-mate <strong>Tom Pidcock</strong> at <strong>40/1</strong>, but with almost no GC experience and with no indication he'll be aiming for yellow, we've not yet included the Briton in the main list.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1241897533.jpg?v=1686127110\" alt=\"Tom Pidcock\" /><em>Tom Pidcock won his first Tour de France stage last year (Image by Getty Images)</em></p>\n\n<p>There's some big names further down the bookmakers' list. Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) sits at <strong>100/1</strong>; unsurprising considering his return from injury after his horrific crash last year. </p>\n<p>The imperious <strong>Wout van Aert</strong> (Jumbo-Visma) isn't far behind at <strong>125/1</strong>, as is <strong>Julian Alaphilippe</strong> (Soudal–Quick-Step), despite never properly contemplating a GC bid.</p>\n<p>A remarkable return to form for four-time winner <strong>Chris Froome</strong> (Israel-Premier Tech) is deemed unlikely, the Briton sitting at <strong>750/1.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Esteban Chaves</strong> (EF Education-EasyPost) and <strong>Giulio Ciccone</strong> (Trek-Segafredo) should perhaps be rewarded with shorter odds considering their stature, but you can get <strong>325/1</strong> and <strong>500/1</strong> respectively for an overall victory.</p>\n<p><em>Cover photo by James Startt</em></p>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"25d836ff93b8cef105d159b9a677768a296d1fdc6c5c526140ee24d6bb2e5ae6","category":"Cycling"}
