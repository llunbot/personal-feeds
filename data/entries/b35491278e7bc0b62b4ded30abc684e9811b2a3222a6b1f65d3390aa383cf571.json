This meant the iPhone 16 Pro would not have been available with 128GB of storage for $999 like the iPhone 15 Pro is, but Gurman believing that the $999 price point will stick around suggests that a 128GB configuration will remain available after all.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has offered at least one Pro model or equivalent tier of the iPhone at a starting price of $999 in the U.S. since the iPhone X was released in 2017.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n$999 or $1,099?
