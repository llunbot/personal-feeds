A unique and incredibly accurate pedal-based tool is fitted to the bike placed on top of it, recording diagnostics of cycling biomechanics including three-dimensional forces and torque at the pedals. Designed in part by Fonda, it cost around €700,000 to develop. Only a few such pedal-based systems are currently in existence, most of them owned by universities and used in their sports laboratories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As absoluteBLACK’s lead scientist, Fonda has been using this state-of-the-art setup to help riders such as Tadej Pogačar and Matej Mohorič hone their positions and work on their riding styles. Possessing a PhD in kinesiology, with an emphasis on inter-muscular coordination during uphill cycling, Fonda is well-placed to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is only a part of his job. In the room across the hall is a testing and development workshop where the product arm of absoluteBLACK tests existing and upcoming products, as well as those of its competitors. The proximity of the two spaces is a neat illustration of how this pan-European component maker feeds scientific and biomechanical insights straight into its designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The reason for doing scientific bike-fits is we get a lot of data and feedback,’ says Fonda from his office just outside the Slovenian capital, Ljubljana. ‘In this way, we study the evolving way people ride bikes, what components they use and what they struggle with.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"absoluteBLACK: Science-driven optimisation\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Data from bike-fits and testing can be reviewed instantly in the studio.</figcaption><figcaption>absoluteBLACK</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>This ever-growing dataset, derived from working with thousands of cyclists ranging from novices to some of the world’s leading professionals, then forms the starting point for the firm’s products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It gives us a clearer idea of what can be optimised,’ says Fonda. ‘Products such as our oval chainrings are the direct result of the things we observe here on a daily basis. This is super-important because we can go from practice to science and vice versa.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Efforts optimised</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Engineering forms the intermediate stage in this process. Since its founding in 2010, absoluteBLACK has focussed on areas where it can improve on what is already offered on the market. ‘Our philosophy is to make riding better, faster and more efficient,’ says Fonda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand’s most emblematic product is its oval chainrings, designed to maximise pedalling effectiveness and metabolic efficiency. ‘In simple terms, we learned, based on our data, how the most efficient riders pedal and then applied it to a product that will help emulate this movement for everyone else,’ Fonda says. The result is a reduction in the energy required to pedal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Imagine doing a squat while holding something heavy on your shoulders,’ explains Fonda. ‘It’s difficult at the very bottom. But at some point you’ll find a position where the weight becomes easier to lift, generally somewhere in the middle. That’s how the human body is designed. We call this the force-length ratio between how the muscle is contracted and its strength. It’s the same when pedalling. At some point in the cycle you’re stronger, and at some point you’re weaker. The oval chainring is designed to fit that pattern. It’s biggest when you’re strongest, and smallest when you’re pushing the least.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"546\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-03-546x970.jpg\" alt=\"absoluteBLACK: Science-driven optimisation\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-03-546x970.jpg 546w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-03-169x300.jpg 169w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-03-768x1365.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-03-864x1536.jpg 864w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-03-1152x2048.jpg 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-03-750x1333.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-03-1140x2026.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>A machine simulates the extreme temperatures created when descending in the mountains.</figcaption><figcaption>absoluteBLACK</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘This is the principle, but the challenge is to find the best possible shape to achieve the best possible efficiency. All the data we collected from biomechanical optimisation sessions with thousands of cyclists was crucial to finding this out. Without it, it would be virtually impossible.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Continuing the academic work he began at the Universities of Birmingham and Primorska, Fonda has been instrumental in refining the timings and profile of the chainrings. ‘The most important part of any product development is to measure things to see what can be improved and then to measure those improvements. To do that, you need specialist tools, which in our case simply didn’t exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We developed a one-of-a-kind 3D force and torque measurement device to actually see how forces are distributed in the pedal during movement,’ Fonda says. ‘Our first surprising discovery was the fact that the majority of riders actually push about 50-70N of force (5-7kg) in the Z axis (to the outside of the bike), which is a complete waste of energy as this force doesn’t contribute to propelling the bike forward. This can be fixed with a few tweaks, but no one really does it because they can’t measure it.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Energy saved</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If maximising the rider’s potential output is one part of the equation, reducing energy wasted is another. In recent years, the company has been applying its science-first approach to reducing drivetrain friction through other products such as graphene-based lubricants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the fitting studio seeks to understand how riders generate power, the room beside it contains a unique apparatus to simulate how this power is applied through the drivetrain. This custom-built testing rig comprises a powerful servo motor with the ability to produce variable angular velocity, powering a disembodied drivetrain, a set of bespoke-made torque transducers (sensors), and a magnetic brake to produce variable braking. It’s here that the firm tests its lubricants and experiments with their formulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We’ve worked a lot with graphene in the past few years,’ says Fonda. ‘It’s very expensive but has excellent characteristics when it comes to reducing friction.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crucially, heat or humidity don’t affect these properties unlike with ‘moly’ (molybdenum disulphide) or graphite. This makes it an excellent contender for lube formulations. ‘Many lubes will perform well in dry conditions. But when you add water, everything changes,’ Fonda adds.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"absoluteBLACK: Science-driven optimisation\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>absoluteBLACK’s pedal-based power meter measures forces in three dimensions.</figcaption><figcaption>absoluteBLACK</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>To that end, absoluteBLACK analysed samples of water collected from the road to better understand what really affects drivetrain performance when it rains and measure how each tested lube behaves under different conditions. Not surprisingly, such samples were found to contain diesel oil and a lot of tiny particles of sand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fonda explains, ‘We recreated such a water mix to mimic real-life weather conditions in the lab as much as possible, to measure how each tested lube behaves under different conditions. All these compounds react with each other in such a complex chemistry that the only way for us to figure it out is a trial-and-error approach. Mix, test, repeat. But that takes time.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fonda demonstrates the effect by splashing some of the water onto a whirring chain. The system is set up to simulate a rider generating 250 watts at 85rpm and using a competitor’s lubricant. The computer attached to the sensors instantly registers an increase in drivetrain friction. A few more squirts and a few more revolutions of the chain, and total drivetrain friction jumps from a negligible 4 watts to a meaningful 13 watts. This quick test has simulated riding in the rain for just under three kilometres. ‘Imagine the effect after 200km,’ says Fonda. ‘Your chain will be pretty much done. After 400km, the friction could be as much as 25 watts.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has certainly worked well for Pogačar, who has used absoluteBLACK’s lubricants on several rain-lashed stages of the Tour de France while defending the yellow jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Heat dissipated</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While its lubricants are designed to help you go faster on the bike, the company also focusses on slowing you down. ‘We always listen to our customers during bike-fitting,’ says Fonda. ‘Most riders have moved to disc brakes in recent years. However, this created a two-pronged challenge, as they were often using rotor diameters that were too small for their weight, and would also retain habits from using rim brakes, such as dragging a brake all the way down the mountain. This creates overheating, which is a safety concern as the ability to stop with overheated brakes deteriorates rapidly.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fonda explains that modern disc brakes were not really designed to be dragged for prolonged periods of time on descents. ‘If your rotor is brown-violet near the friction part of the rotor, you are overheating it too often.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response, absoluteBLACK set about creating disc pads that would tolerate such behaviour. ‘We knew we had to design finned pads with large radiators to dissipate as much heat as possible, but the real challenge is how to move the heat fast enough from the friction compound, which is essentially an isolator, to the conductive backing plate, and then spread it around the radiator equally quickly,’ Fonda says. ‘It turns out that graphene has a few more interesting properties apart from lowering friction. It also has great heat conductivity, strength, and IR radiation.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"absoluteBLACK: Science-driven optimisation\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/absoluteblack-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Gaining real-time insight into drivetrain friction.</figcaption><figcaption>absoluteBLACK</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>While absoluteBLACK isn’t in fact the first company to utilise the idea of having graphene in its disc pad friction material – major automotive companies have patent applications for similar solutions – it is the first in the bicycle industry. ‘It’s not as easy as just sprinkling graphene to existing friction compounds and job done,’ Fonda says. ‘If you do that, everything changes for the worse. Friction material has five main groups of additives. Lubricants counter very high friction from the thermosetting polymer (resin) that binds all ingredients. Graphene is also a lubricant. So if you add it without taking anything away, the friction compound has too low friction. To counter it, you add more abrasive ceramics, but then you make it too abrasive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s a very slow process of making different compounds and testing them on a special rig until the results meet your objectives. This is also the reason why most pads seen on the market come from just one Taiwanese factory that offers a very short selection of friction compounds in its catalogue.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>One step back</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all of absoluteBLACK’s projects make it to market. The company’s extensive research in the field would seem to make it an ideal candidate for developing chain technology. Yet its collaboration with one chain maker resulted in a prototype that failed to substantially improve upon what was already available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We had this great idea how to improve on chain lube penetration into the chain link pin,’ Fonda says. ‘This is a known issue, where if you simply drip a lube onto the chain links, it takes some time for the lube to penetrate into the pin. During that time, the drivetrain experiences lubricant starvation and higher friction. To combat that, we elaborately modified the inner link protrusions, allowing faster lube penetration, but during testing we found we were able to achieve a better result by changing the approach and using a vacuum to lubricate a standard chain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘This is the entire point of research. You try and you fail, then you try again. Once you have exhausted all of your ideas for improvement, perhaps it’s a good time to change your approach. But if you don’t try, you don’t know.’</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/absoluteblack\">absoluteBLACK: Science-driven optimisation</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"993a6c5a300a9a7163879c2ad3b0c6cf32f0cb9f97639e37d76ad9c798301914","category":"Cycling"}
