Case studies are from <strong>industry experts</strong> from teams at Instagram, Shopify, Netflix, eBay, Figma, Spotify, Wix, Lyft, LinkedIn, and many more. Guidance that stands the test of time.</p>\n\n<p>Join Addy Osmani, your curator, as we dive into a nuanced look at several key topics that will teach you tips and tricks that may help you optimize your own sites. The book also includes short interviews with contributors on what additional <strong>lessons, challenges, and tips</strong> they have to share some time after the case studies were written.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Performance</strong> includes examples of measuring, budgeting, optimizing, and monitoring performance, in addition to tips for building a performance culture.</li>\n<li><strong>Capabilities</strong> is about bridging the gap between native capabilities and the modern web. You’ll explore web apps, native apps, and progressive web applications.</li>\n<li><strong>Accessibility</strong> makes web apps viable for diverse users, including people with temporary or permanent disabilities. Most of us will have a disability at some point in our lives, and these case studies show how we can make the web work for all of us.</li>\n<li><strong>Developer Experience</strong> is about building a project environment and culture that encourage support, growth, and problem-solving within teams. Strong teams build great projects!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>High-quality hardcover</strong>, 304-page print book. Curated by Addy Osmani.
