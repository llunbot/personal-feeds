The camera technology was not added to the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌, marking one of the first times that Apple has added camera technology to one Pro device and not the other.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe limitation was rumored to be because of space constraints, with only the Pro Max able to accommodate the hardware, but yield may have also been a factor. According to Kuo, when lens supplier Largan was producing the tetraprism hardware for the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max in the third quarter of 2023, production yield was at just 40 percent. Yield has now improved to 70 percent or more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is planning to increase the size of the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro to 6.3 inches, up from 6.1 inches, which will allow for more space for camera hardware. With the size increase and the yield improvement, Apple has addressed the factors that likely kept the tetraprism lens limited to the larger Pro Max <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is not yet clear if Apple has plans to make improvements to the tetraprism lens in 2024.
