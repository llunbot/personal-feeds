Apple also sells it in space gray, midnight, starlight, space black, and silver.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe USB-C to ‌MagSafe‌ 3 cable is priced at $49.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-usb-c-magsafe-cable-sky-blue/\">Apple Selling New Sky Blue USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable to Match M4 MacBook Air</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-selling-new-sky-blue-usb-c-to-magsafe-3-cable-to-match-m4-macbook-air.2452088/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8f03e757570c0204e8debad26aa723c9e22d74713c0bb756373cd63cb91e1de3","category":"Apple"}
