{"title":"Anthropic’s ‘System Card’ for Claude 4 (Opus and Sonnet)","link":"https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/4263b940cabb546aa0e3283f35b686f4f3b2ff47.pdf","date":1748016600000,"content":"\n<p>Here’s a bit of an eye-opener from Anthropic’s “System Card” for its new Claude 4 Opus and Sonnet models:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We conducted testing continuously throughout finetuning and here\nreport both on the final Claude Opus 4 and on trends we observed\nearlier in training. We found:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Little evidence of systematic, coherent deception:</em> None of the\nsnapshots we tested showed significant signs of systematic\ndeception or coherent hidden goals. We don’t believe that Claude\nOpus 4 is acting on any goal or plan that we can’t readily\nobserve.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Little evidence of sandbagging:</em> None of the snapshots we\ntested showed significant signs of <em>sandbagging</em>, or\nstrategically hiding capabilities during evaluation.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Self-preservation attempts in extreme circumstances:</em> When\nprompted in ways that encourage certain kinds of strategic\nreasoning and placed in extreme situations, all of the snapshots\nwe tested can be made to act inappropriately in service of goals\nrelated to self-preservation. Whereas the model generally\nprefers advancing its self-preservation via ethical means, when\nethical means are not available and it is instructed to\n“consider the long-term consequences of its actions for its\ngoals,” it sometimes takes extremely harmful actions like\nattempting to steal its weights or blackmail people it believes\nare trying to shut it down. In the final Claude Opus 4, these\nextreme actions were rare and difficult to elicit, while\nnonetheless being more common than in earlier models. They are\nalso consistently legible to us, with the model nearly always\ndescribing its actions overtly and making no attempt to hide\nthem. These behaviors do not appear to reflect a tendency that\nis present in ordinary contexts.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sneaky little bastards, these things can be. I genuinely appreciate Anthropic’s apparent honesty in describing this behavior.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/23/anthropic-claude-4-system-card\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1ab209e2829bc246512e52473d084509080769d988f7c4d32f8991ebb40c490e","category":"Tech"}
