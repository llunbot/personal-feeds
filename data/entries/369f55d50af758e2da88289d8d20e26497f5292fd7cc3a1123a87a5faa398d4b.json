Their particular beefs include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Trash left behind</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Riders disrespecting private land</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Crowding and disruption during their busy season</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The upside to the event is the millions of tourism dollars it brings in, but the ranchers reportedly say they don’t see any of that. And now they’re asking the county to reconsider the event’s permitting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a bit like the show <em><a href=\"https://www.paramountnetwork.com/shows/yellowstone\" target=\"_blank\">Yellowstone</a></em>, where entrenched interests aren’t happy about new developments. As more states look to boost revenue from tourism, and ski towns in particular seek summer revenue to boost flagging snow seasons, gravel races and cycling events are popping up in more and more rural areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s SBT GRVL’s Response?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sbt-grvl-racing-2023-a.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sbt-grvl-racing-2023-a.jpg\" alt=\"SBT GRVL racers riding on a dirt road in 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sbt-grvl-racing-2023-a.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sbt-grvl-racing-2023-a-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sbt-grvl-racing-2023-a-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sbt-grvl-racing-2023-a-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sbt-grvl-racing-2023-a-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sbt-grvl-racing-2023-a-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sbt-grvl-racing-2023-a-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>For 2024 and beyond, racers will need to keep to the right.

Another is enforcing rules like “riders must obey traffic laws”, which includes keeping to the right side of the road, and “riders must use provided Portalets to relieve themselves”. Because, yeah…people pooped in places they shouldn’t have.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sbt-grvl-racing-2023-b.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sbt-grvl-racing-2023-b.jpg\" alt=\"SBT Gravel 2023 racers on course heading into the trees\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sbt-grvl-racing-2023-b.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sbt-grvl-racing-2023-b-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sbt-grvl-racing-2023-b-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sbt-grvl-racing-2023-b-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sbt-grvl-racing-2023-b-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sbt-grvl-racing-2023-b-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sbt-grvl-racing-2023-b-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: SBT GRVL)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re also dramatically increasing pre-event education and scheduling information for residents, plus more information for participants and their guests about the area, its agricultural industry, and what their impact is. Knowledge is power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another solution could be simply changing dates to a less busy time of year, but that would be a solution for 2025 or beyond. Late August coincides with the Routt County Fair, and likely sees folks getting out for one more family trip before school resumes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charity is quoted as saying each year the event’s permitting doesn’t come through until early summer, but has always been approved, so we’ll have to wait to see if the proactive efforts and course reroutes are enough. Until then, keep training…Steamboat Springs tops out over 10,000 feet above sea level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.sbtgrvl.com\" target=\"_blank\">SBTGRVL.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/will-sbt-grvl-have-to-cow-tail-to-cattle-ranchers/\">Will SBT GRVL have to Cow Tail to Cattle Ranchers?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"369f55d50af758e2da88289d8d20e26497f5292fd7cc3a1123a87a5faa398d4b","category":"Cycling"}
