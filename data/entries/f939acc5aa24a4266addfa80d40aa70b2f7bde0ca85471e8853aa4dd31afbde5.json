The trailer is just as good as the first one, giving us even more of Michael Keaton's Batman and plenty of action, emotional beats, and even a few hints about how it might upend the entire DC Extended Universe going forward.</p>\n<p>As we've <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/michael-keatons-batman-steals-every-scene-in-official-trailer-for-the-flash/\">previously reported</a>, Andy Muschietti (<em>It, It: Chapter 2</em>) signed on to direct the long-planned Flash-centric standalone film in 2019. Ezra Miller's The Flash had already made his DC Extended Universe debut with cameo appearances in <em>Batman v Superman</em> and <em>Suicide Squad </em>in 2016 and as a co-star in 2017's <em>Justice League</em>. And the wider DC multiverse was confirmed when Miller made a cameo in the <em>Arrowverse</em> TV crossover event <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em> (2019–2020). </p>\n<p>Earlier scripts focused on adapting the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashpoint_(comics)\"><em>Flashpoint</em></a> crossover storyline from the comic books, in which the Scarlet Speedster goes back in time to keep his mother from being murdered, thereby altering the entire timeline. In that alternate world, a young Bruce Wayne is killed rather than his parents. Thomas Wayne becomes Batman, Martha Wayne becomes the Joker, Wonder Woman and Aquaman are bitter enemies, and Superman is a prisoner. Muschietti kept several of the <em>Flashpoint</em> story elements while acknowledging that this would be a different version. And he wanted to include not just Michael Keaton's Batman but Ben Affleck's, too, since he thought Barry's relationship with the latter would make Keaton's inclusion even more powerful.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934555#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934555&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f939acc5aa24a4266addfa80d40aa70b2f7bde0ca85471e8853aa4dd31afbde5","category":"Tech"}
