Some websites may have issues, like showing content for the wrong region or requiring extra steps to sign in.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌iCloud‌ Private Relay is a service that's designed to ensure Safari traffic leaving an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, or Mac is encrypted through two separate internet relays so that companies can't use personal information like IP address, location, and browsing activity to build detailed profiles about Apple device users.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's release notes for the new updates made available today also confirm that several issues have been addressed.\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>The Bay Bridge now scales correctly at high zoom levels in the Maps app.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> can be used to switch to a Focus other than Do Not Disturb.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Safari Extensions now correctly appear in the Smart Search field when Show Separate Tab Bar is selected.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>The clear button in the search bar in Safari is no longer clipped.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>VPN apps now connect if they use a private API that no longer exists in ‌iOS 15‌.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Collapsing the hardware keyboard shortcut bar now properly invokes leading and trailing edge changes for UIKeyboardLayoutGuide.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\nWith seven betas now released, we are getting close to the end of the testing period for ‌iOS 15‌. We can expect the new software to launch ahead of refreshed iPhones, likely in September.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/25/icloud-private-relay-ios-15-public-beta/\">Apple to Release iOS 15 iCloud Private Relay as a Public Beta</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-release-ios-15-icloud-private-relay-as-a-public-beta.2308653/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bF5OWKMRLUw:GAWCvrzb0as:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bF5OWKMRLUw:GAWCvrzb0as:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/bF5OWKMRLUw\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2294efd63597a3a6fd8f8969bb4c206e706b3af52ba93b61a7858f7353f6017c","category":"Apple"}
