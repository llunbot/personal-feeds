We first launched our 55 Carbon Aero Disc as a hookless road rim a few years ago but moved away since there weren’t as many hookless compatible options at the time. More tire options available today, and with a greater call from our sponsored teams and riders to create a stronger, lighter weight and stiffer wheelset for big days out in the mountains we couldn’t have thought of a better place to use the hookless tech.”</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23095704/prototype-hunt-road-bike-wheels-with-carbon-spokes-6.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23095704/prototype-hunt-road-bike-wheels-with-carbon-spokes-6.jpg\" alt=\"prototype hunt ud 32 road bike wheels with carbon spokes\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23095704/prototype-hunt-road-bike-wheels-with-carbon-spokes-6.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23095704/prototype-hunt-road-bike-wheels-with-carbon-spokes-6-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23095704/prototype-hunt-road-bike-wheels-with-carbon-spokes-6-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23095704/prototype-hunt-road-bike-wheels-with-carbon-spokes-6-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23095704/prototype-hunt-road-bike-wheels-with-carbon-spokes-6-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23095704/prototype-hunt-road-bike-wheels-with-carbon-spokes-6-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>“On top of that, with the UD carbon spokes having a greater Ultimate Tensile Strength than steel spokes, it’s able to compensating for the issue some shallower rim wheelsets have with too much flex and not providing the “reactiveness” some people experience.”</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23095658/prototype-hunt-road-bike-wheels-with-carbon-spokes-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23095658/prototype-hunt-road-bike-wheels-with-carbon-spokes-4.jpg\" alt=\"prototype hunt ud 32 road bike wheels with carbon spokes\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23095658/prototype-hunt-road-bike-wheels-with-carbon-spokes-4.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23095658/prototype-hunt-road-bike-wheels-with-carbon-spokes-4-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23095658/prototype-hunt-road-bike-wheels-with-carbon-spokes-4-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23095658/prototype-hunt-road-bike-wheels-with-carbon-spokes-4-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23095658/prototype-hunt-road-bike-wheels-with-carbon-spokes-4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23095658/prototype-hunt-road-bike-wheels-with-carbon-spokes-4-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>They’ve hinted the official release is coming soon, stay tuned…</p><p><a href=\"https://www.huntbikewheels.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>HuntBikeWheels.com</em></a></p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b31f93e410b24bd65b10f8eb5783bc9f1f0861d70592c175d3cdccfa760ff236","category":"Cycling"}
