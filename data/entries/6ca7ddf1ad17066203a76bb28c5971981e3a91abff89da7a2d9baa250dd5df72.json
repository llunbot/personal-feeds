[credit:\n                              Microsoft                            ]\n                      </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n<p>Windows XP was an actively supported Microsoft product for 13 years, including five years where it was the newest version available and another three years where it was vastly more popular than <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/windows-10-gets-major-update-as-windows-vista-reaches-its-end-of-life/\">its successor</a>. That longevity—plus Microsoft's total domination of personal computing in the pre-iPhone, pre-Android world—helped make its default wallpaper one of the most recognizable images on the planet.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft is returning to the Bliss hill once again with <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=178577\">this year's entry</a> in its now-traditional ugly retro-computing sweater series. Blue hemming at the bottom and on the sleeves evokes Windows XP's bright-blue taskbar, and in case people don't immediately recognize Bliss as \"a computer thing,\" there's also a giant mouse pointer hovering over it.</p>\n<p>The sweater is available from size small up to a 3XL, and <a href=\"https://gear.xbox.com/products/windows-merry-blissmas-knit-holiday-sweater?variant=42532147658917\">costs $70</a> regardless of which version you buy. All sizes are currently expected to arrive sometime between December 2 and 6.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986635#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986635&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6ca7ddf1ad17066203a76bb28c5971981e3a91abff89da7a2d9baa250dd5df72","category":"Tech"}
