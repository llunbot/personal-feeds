But then the studio foundered badly with a couple of box office flops: 2022's <em>Morbius</em> and 2024's <em>Madame Web</em>.</p>\n<p>Sony hopes to right the ship with a third Venom film in October (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom:_The_Last_Dance\"><em>The Last Dance</em></a>) and the much-delayed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraven_the_Hunter_(film)\"><em>Kraven the Hunter</em></a> this December. We've got a new trailer for the latter, leaning heavily into R-rated gore and set to Johnny Cash's moodily atmospheric \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiMXK9eDrMY\">The Man Comes Around.</a>\" It's an entirely different, darker vibe from prior offerings: a revenge narrative rife with violence and daddy issues.

He's a Russian immigrant with an aristocratic background who fled his home country when Tsar Nicholas II's reign collapsed in 1917. He's a big game hunter with enhanced abilities thanks to ingesting a mysterious potion made from jungle herbs. He's very hard to injure, has super-human strength, and enhanced sight, hearing, and smell, as well as being a good tactician with excellent hand-to-hand combat skills.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043361#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043361&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"86b61187a4ccb1b688a6592991727e1e2b570eb71875696cc937d9a478c845f1","category":"Tech"}
