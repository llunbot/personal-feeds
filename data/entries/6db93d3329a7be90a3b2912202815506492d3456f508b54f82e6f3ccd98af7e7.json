In the equipment section of the filing, Apple lists four \"New Phone\" items while also listing A2176, A2172, A2341, and A2342, which correspond to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12 mini</a>, ‌iPhone 12‌, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 12 Pro</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 12 Pro Max</a>, respectively, as \"legacy\" devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEarlier in the summer, Apple registered four new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models in the EEC database, providing us with model IDs for the upcoming iPhones. However, today's new filing doesn't include any model numbers for the \"New Phone\" items, making it difficult to tie a connection between the filing and the EEC entry.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAmongst the features expected for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>, Apple is expected to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/15/iphone-13-always-on-display-stronger-magesafe/\">improving the strength of the MagSafe magnets</a> on the back of the new iPhones. While the filing doesn't confirm that, Apple may have needed to retest the charger as per FCC regulation on the new iPhones, given their stronger ‌MagSafe‌ system than the 2020 lineup. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is widely expected to be holding an all-digital event next week on Tuesday, September 14, where it will announce the ‌iPhone 13‌ as well as the Apple Watch Series 7. Apple may confirm the event as early as Tuesday. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/07/magsafe-charger-filing-new-iphones/\">Apple Labels iPhone 12 As 'Legacy' Device, Lists Four Unreleased iPhones in New MagSafe Charger FCC Filing</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-labels-iphone-12-as-legacy-device-lists-four-unreleased-iphones-in-new-magsafe-charger-fcc-filing.2309915/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0RDSQTN2Yzg:k-wEXQnD0BY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0RDSQTN2Yzg:k-wEXQnD0BY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/0RDSQTN2Yzg\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6db93d3329a7be90a3b2912202815506492d3456f508b54f82e6f3ccd98af7e7","category":"Apple"}
