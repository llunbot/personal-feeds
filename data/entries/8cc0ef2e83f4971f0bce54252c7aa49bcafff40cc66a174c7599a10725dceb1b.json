Buyers establish their individual requirements through a custom bike fit at Aston Martin HQ in Gaydon, Warwickshire in the UK. Next, J.Laverack 3D-prints a unique set of 6Al/4V titanium lugs then bonded to sculpted carbon tubes. Then, Aston Martin &amp; J.Laverack finish off the bike and its integrated components in a mix of Cerakote, wet paint, and exposed carbon weave to suit the buyer’s tastes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_match-bike-to-supercar.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_match-bike-to-supercar.jpg\" alt=\"J-Laverack Aston Martin .1R bespoke carbon &amp; titanium road bike, made in the UK, luxury custom and fully integrated, matchy-macty with your supercar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_match-bike-to-supercar.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_match-bike-to-supercar-297x134.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_match-bike-to-supercar-800x360.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_match-bike-to-supercar-120x54.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_match-bike-to-supercar-768x346.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_match-bike-to-supercar-1536x691.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, bike buyer pick from the exact same color palettes and trim choices offered on Aston Martin’s cars, delivering “<em>the opportunity to pair car and bike, should they wish to.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That whole custom process is completely individualized to each buyer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we expect it to come with a pricetag worthy of an Aston Martin motorcar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s so unique?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_Titanium-3D-printed-frame-lugs-by-Aston-Martin.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_Titanium-3D-printed-frame-lugs-by-Aston-Martin.jpg\" alt=\"J-Laverack Aston Martin .1R bespoke carbon &amp; titanium road bike, made in the UK, luxury custom and fully integrated, 3D-printed ti lugs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_Titanium-3D-printed-frame-lugs-by-Aston-Martin.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_Titanium-3D-printed-frame-lugs-by-Aston-Martin-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_Titanium-3D-printed-frame-lugs-by-Aston-Martin-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_Titanium-3D-printed-frame-lugs-by-Aston-Martin-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_Titanium-3D-printed-frame-lugs-by-Aston-Martin-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_Titanium-3D-printed-frame-lugs-by-Aston-Martin-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_Titanium-3D-printed-frame-lugs-by-Aston-Martin-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oddly, 3D-printed ti lugs bonded to carbon tubes are surprisingly more and more common these days.

Neatly integrated into the 3D-printed ti dropouts, the .1R features custom 4-piston brake calipers. Aston Martin machines the brake bodies from a single block of aluminum, and the pistons from titanium, created for unparalleled stopping power and smooth pad retraction. Interestingly, Laverack appears to be able to pair them from standard brake levers from Shimano, SRAM, or Campagnolo.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_custom-made-brake-calipers.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1885\" height=\"1351\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_custom-made-brake-calipers.jpg\" alt=\"J-Laverack Aston Martin .1R bespoke carbon &amp; titanium road bike, made in the UK, Aston Matrin made brake calipers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_custom-made-brake-calipers.jpg 1885w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_custom-made-brake-calipers-297x213.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_custom-made-brake-calipers-800x573.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_custom-made-brake-calipers-120x86.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_custom-made-brake-calipers-768x550.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_custom-made-brake-calipers-1536x1101.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The custom brakes also get their own matching custom Aston Martin Valkyrie wheel-inspired 160mm brake rotors.
