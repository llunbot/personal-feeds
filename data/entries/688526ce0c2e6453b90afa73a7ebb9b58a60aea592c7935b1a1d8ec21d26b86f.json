The same thing can happen with 3D and 4D printing if the print nozzle is too far from the printing substrate. Harvard scientists have taken a page from the innovative methods of abstract expressionist artist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock\">Jackson Pollock</a>—aka the \"splatter master\"—to exploit the underlying physics rather than try to control it to significantly speed up the process, according to a <a href=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/sm/d3sm00177f/unauth\">new paper</a> published in the journal Soft Matter. With the help of machine learning, the authors were able to decorate a cookie with chocolate syrup to demonstrate the viability of their new approach.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/splatter-master-jackson-pollock-avoided-coiling-when-creating-his-paintings/\">reported previously</a>, Pollock early on employed a \"flying filament\" or \"flying catenary\" technique before he perfected his dripping methods. The paint forms various viscous filaments that are thrown against a vertical canvas. The dripping technique involved laying a canvas flat on the floor and then pouring paint on top of it. Sometimes, he poured it directly from a can; sometimes he used a stick, knife, or brush; and sometimes he used a syringe. The artist usually \"rhythmically\" moved around the canvas as he worked. His style has long fascinated physicists, as evidenced by the <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/httpblogsscientificamericancomcocktail-party-physics20110718physicists-embrace-the-splatter-master/\">controversy surrounding</a> the question of whether <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=100098X1555750&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=13.24.0-stackpath&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Fscience%2F2018%2F12%2Fstudy-modern-masters-like-jackson-pollock-were-intuitive-physicists%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fnature05398&amp;xguid=&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=480&amp;xuuid=53ec6852fc328690b001a62295c89b2e&amp;xcust=xid:fr1698947288612bda\">or not</a> Pollock's paintings show evidence <a href=\"http://discovermagazine.com/2001/nov/featpollock\">of fractal patterns.</a></p>\n<p>Back in 2011, Harvard mathematician Lakshminarayanan Mahadevan collaborated with art historian Claude Cernuschi on an <a href=\"https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.3603916\">article for Physics Today</a> examining Pollock's use of <a href=\"http://cenblog.org/artful-science/2011/07/03/jackson-pollock-physics/\">a \"coiling instability\"</a> in his paintings. The study mathematically describes how a viscous fluid folds onto itself like a coiling rope—just like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/07/science/physicists-study-the-honeybee-for-clues-to-complex-problems.html\">pouring cold maple syrup</a> on pancakes. </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980704#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980704&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"688526ce0c2e6453b90afa73a7ebb9b58a60aea592c7935b1a1d8ec21d26b86f","category":"Tech"}
