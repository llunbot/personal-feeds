Apple lets you sync note entries across all your iCloud-linked devices to give you the broadest access to them. However, having access in more places can also make it easier to delete a note accidentally or not consider that it will be deleted everywhere. Or, you may have removed an entry and want to recover it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how to find recently deleted notes, and make a last-ditch effort using Time Machine for older lost ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to recover a deleted note</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As in most of Apple’s library-based apps, Notes offers a Recently Deleted folder that acts as a “you may change your mind” holding area for about 30 days. When you delete an item, it winds up in this folder. You may not use folders in Notes routinely. Here’s how to find them:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>In macOS, click the sidebar icon on the far left of the toolbar of choose <em>View &gt; Show Folders</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In iOS or iPadOS, tap in the upper-left corner of Notes until you see Folders.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>At iCloud.com, the folders list always shows at less.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-in-recently-deleted-mac-bordered.png?w=1200\" alt=\"macOS Notes recently deleted\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-in-recently-deleted-mac-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1682w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-in-recently-deleted-mac-bordered.png?resize=300%2C154&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-in-recently-deleted-mac-bordered.png?resize=768%2C395&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-in-recently-deleted-mac-bordered.png?resize=1200%2C616&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-in-recently-deleted-mac-bordered.png?resize=1536%2C789&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"616\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>The Recently Deleted folder holds removed items for 30 days or so.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"macOS Notes recently deleted\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-in-recently-deleted-mac-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1682w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-in-recently-deleted-mac-bordered.png?resize=300%2C154&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-in-recently-deleted-mac-bordered.png?resize=768%2C395&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-in-recently-deleted-mac-bordered.png?resize=1200%2C616&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-in-recently-deleted-mac-bordered.png?resize=1536%2C789&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"616\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The Recently Deleted folder holds removed items for 30 days or so.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"macOS Notes recently deleted\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-in-recently-deleted-mac-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1682w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-in-recently-deleted-mac-bordered.png?resize=300%2C154&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-in-recently-deleted-mac-bordered.png?resize=768%2C395&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-in-recently-deleted-mac-bordered.png?resize=1200%2C616&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-in-recently-deleted-mac-bordered.png?resize=1536%2C789&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"616\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The Recently Deleted folder holds removed items for 30 days or so.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>(I found a bug in testing: deleting a note from my Mac resulted in showing up in Recently Deleted on that Mac and at iCloud.com, but not in Notes for iOS. Deleting an entry in iOS revealed the Recently Deleted folder, which shows the note I had removed in macOS.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has never fully sorted out the interface for Notes, particularly across its platforms, so there’s no single way to recover a deleted note in all versions. Here’s how you can recover a note:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>In macOS, iOS, or iPadOS, the easiest way is to try to edit the note, at which point you’re prompted to Cancel or Recover. Click or tap <em>Recover</em>. You can also Control-click/right-click a note in macOS and choose <em>Move</em> or swipe left in iOS/iPadOS and tap the folder icon to move it to another location in Notes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>At iCloud.com, select the note and click <em>Recover</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Whichever method you choose recovers the note across all your iCloud-linked devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to delete a note permanently</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, if you want the entry to go away forever:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>In macOS, select the note and press <em>Delete</em>, select the note and click the trash can icon, or Control-click/right-click the entry.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In iOS/iPadOS, swipe left and tap the trash can icon, or select the note and tap the trash can icon at the bottom-left corner of the view.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>At iCloud.com, select the note and click the trash can icon in the upper-right corner of the window.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-permanent-delete-warning-bordered.png\" alt=\"macOS Notes permanently delete\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-permanent-delete-warning-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 522w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-permanent-delete-warning-bordered.png?resize=300%2C254&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w\" width=\"522\" height=\"442\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>You can intentionally delete a note permanently, but it requires extra steps, which include this warning.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"macOS Notes permanently delete\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-permanent-delete-warning-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 522w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-permanent-delete-warning-bordered.png?resize=300%2C254&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w\" width=\"522\" height=\"442\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>You can intentionally delete a note permanently, but it requires extra steps, which include this warning.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"macOS Notes permanently delete\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-permanent-delete-warning-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 522w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mac911-note-permanent-delete-warning-bordered.png?resize=300%2C254&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w\" width=\"522\" height=\"442\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>You can intentionally delete a note permanently, but it requires extra steps, which include this warning.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re prompted when you try to delete a note from Recently Deleted with a warning about that erasure becoming permanent.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Recover a note via  Time Machine</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Notes are backed up by Time Machine, and if you are trying to retrieve a note after 30 days or so and it’s no longer in the Recently Deleted folder, you can try to roll back to an early set of entries on your Mac. This is dangerous in that it will be trivial to overwrite all your current notes, and Notes offers no export library option that you can use to re-import current notes. <em>Please proceed only if you’re trying to recover critical data and have no other recourse.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d recommend reading <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-back-up-apple-notes-mac/&amp;xcust=1-1-2341755-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">this Make Use Of advice</a> on creating backups of Notes before proceeding in case these steps fail for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow these steps carefully:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Quit Notes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the Finder, choose <em>Go &gt; Go to Folder</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enter <code>~/Library/Group Containers/</code> and press return.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the resulting folder, you’ll find <code>group.com.apple.notes</code>.
