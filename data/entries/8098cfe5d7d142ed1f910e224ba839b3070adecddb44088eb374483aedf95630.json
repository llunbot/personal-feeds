They fixed most of the bugs and balance issues present in the originals—partly by also including the rosters from <em>Gold</em>/<em>Silver</em> and <em>Ruby</em>/<em>Sapphire</em>—but they're more faithful to the original gameplay, battling and catching mechanics, and graphics than the 2018 <em>Let's Go, Pikachu/Eevee!</em> adaptations for the Switch.</p>\n<p>Someone at Nintendo apparently agrees, as the company <a href=\"https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/the-pokemon-firered-version-and-pokemon-leafgreen-version-games-are-releasing-on-nintendo-switch?cid=&amp;utm_source=tw&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=vg&amp;utm_term=frlgnswitch\">announced today</a> that it's re-releasing those games for the original Switch (and, by extension, the Switch 2, though no Switch 2-specific features were announced). The games will be available after a planned <em>Pokémon Presents</em> stream at 9 am Eastern/6 am Pacific on February 27.</p>\n<p>Subscribers to the <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/online/nintendo-switch-online/expansion-pack/\">Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> are in for a disappointment, though. Instead of releasing <em>FireRed </em>and <em>LeafGreen </em>as part of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/a-quick-look-at-the-switchs-new-game-boy-and-game-boy-advance-emulation/\">Switch Online Game Boy Advance</a> collection, Nintendo will release both titles as standalone purchases that will run you $20 apiece. This means that players without a subscription will be able to buy and play the games. But given <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Classics#Game_Boy_Advance\">how few GBA games are available</a> for the Switch Online service and how infrequently new ones are released, it does rankle to see otherwise unmodified ports of a prominent game bypass subscribers entirely.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/pokemon-red-and-greens-gba-remakes-are-getting-re-released-on-switch-for-20-a-pop/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/pokemon-red-and-greens-gba-remakes-are-getting-re-released-on-switch-for-20-a-pop/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8098cfe5d7d142ed1f910e224ba839b3070adecddb44088eb374483aedf95630","category":"Tech"}
