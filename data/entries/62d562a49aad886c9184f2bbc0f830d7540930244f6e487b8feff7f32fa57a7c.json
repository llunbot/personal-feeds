{"title":"Get $15 in Amazon credit when you buy $100 in Apple gift cards","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/556053/amazon-cyber-monday-apple-gift-card-promo-credit.html","date":1638180900000,"content":"<div>\n<section><div></div></section><p>What do you buy the Apple fan who has everything? An Apple gift card! And right now, you can give yourself a little something if you buy Apple gift cards from Amazon. Amazon is offering a special promotion where you can get <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/promotion/psp/A3BI4TFQ8GE4R3?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$15 in Amazon credit if you buy $100 or more in Apple gift cards</a>. That $15 credit can come in handy with the rest of your holiday shopping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To take advantage of this offer, go to the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/promotion/psp/A3BI4TFQ8GE4R3?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon Apple card promo page</a>. Then select the Apple gift cards you want–the total value of the gift cards must be $100 or more to get the Amazon credit. When you go to check out, look for the notification that says you qualify for the $15 promotional credit. If you don’t see it, enter the promo code <strong>APPLENOV</strong> at checkout and apply it.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/amazon-credit.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /><figcaption><p>Look for this notification when you check out to make sure you get the Amazon credit.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Amazon</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that the credit is <em>Amazon</em> credit, not Apple credit, and counts only to your Amazon account. Only one credit is allowed per customer. This is a limited-time offer. Credits should arrive within three days. Also, it probably goes without saying but we’ll mention it anyway to be clear: the Apple gift cards cannot be used at Amazon and can only be used towards purchases at Apple stores or the App Stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>More Apple Black Friday Deals</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553299/best-black-friday-macbook-deals.html\">Best Black Friday MacBook deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553913/best-black-friday-imac-and-mac-mini-deals.html\">Best Black Friday iMac and Mac mini deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553018/best-black-friday-iphone-deals.html\">Best Black Friday iPhone deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/555651/black-friday-magsafe-charger-accessory-deals-2021.html\">Best Black Friday MagSafe charger and accessory deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/554337/best-black-friday-ipad-deals.html\">Best Black Friday iPad deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553124/black-friday-2021-the-best-apple-watch-deals.html\">Best Black Friday Apple Watch Deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553143/best-black-friday-airpods-deals.html\">Best Black Friday AirPods Deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/552862/best-black-friday-airtag-deals.html\">Best Black Friday AirTag Deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/555374/best-black-friday-apple-tv-homepod-deals-2021.html\">Best Black Friday Apple TV and HomePod deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553617/apple-black-friday-shopping-event-2021.html\">Apple’s Black Friday Sale</a></li><li>Also check out the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/apple-black-friday-3664699/\">best Apple deals</a> over on our sister site Macworld U.K.</li></ul><figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n</div>","author":"Roman Loyola","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"62d562a49aad886c9184f2bbc0f830d7540930244f6e487b8feff7f32fa57a7c","category":"Apple"}
