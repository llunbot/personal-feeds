As BMW's head designer <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/big-grilles-and-more-suvs-we-talk-bmw-design-with-adrian-van-hooydonk/\">told Ars last year</a>, \"People were prepared to make all these compromises because it was cool.

The best year for the SC430—its replacement and the last car factory-fitted with a cassette player—was about half that volume. But in 2023, it's lucky to sell more than 100 LC coupes nationwide each month. Those who take the plunge will find dramatic styling inside and out, and in the case of this LC 500h, a rather intriguing hybrid powertrain.</p>\n<p>The LC has been on sale for years—Ars first sampled one in 2018—but until now, we'd never spent more than a day with swoopy coupé and minimal time with the hybrid version.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960689#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960689&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
