He also said the foldable-screen MacBook will be equipped with Apple's next-generation M5 chip, which has yet to be announced.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt seems like a foldable-screen MacBook is still a few years away, and Apple will firm up its plans for the device as its launch gets closer.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/\">Ross Young</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-macbook/\">Foldable MacBook</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/18-8-inch-foldable-macbook-rumor/\">MacBook With Foldable Display Will Actually Have 18.8-Inch Screen, Analyst Says</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-with-foldable-display-will-actually-have-18-8-inch-screen-analyst-says.2427206/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ec97bd4810498b5ab1b03b747ede3d01bef32f59e70b16cb5f425b2aec907a7b","category":"Apple"}
