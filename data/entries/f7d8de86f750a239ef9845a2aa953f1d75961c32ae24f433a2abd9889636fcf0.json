This has fostered a new generation of British riders in cycling’s top division, with 18 riders now signed onto the sport’s biggest teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That number is actually a decrease of two from last year – or four if you count the two <em>stagiaires </em>who tagged onto WorldTour teams halfway through the season. That said, there were only 13 when the Women’s WorldTour was restructured into its current form in 2022. The UK is currently the fifth most common nationality in the Women’s WorldTour, trailing behind only the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium and France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike in the men’s WorldTour, there are no British-registered women’s teams in the top flight at the moment, so the Brits are spread out across several teams. Picnic-PostNL is the most common destination for British riders with four, closely followed by Lidl-Trek and Movistar with three Brits on their rosters.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Zoe Bäckstedt (Canyon-SRAM-Zondacrypto)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-10-970x647.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-10-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-10-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-10-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-10-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-10-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-10-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-10-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-10-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-10-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-10.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Daughter of Paris-Roubaix winner Magnus Bäckstedt, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/zoe-backstedt-cyclist\">Zoe</a> is one of the most exciting young riders in the peloton. She burst through the youth ranks in 2021 after winning the junior road race at the World Championships. This was backed up by a gold in the time-trial and world titles in both cyclocross and track. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rider from South Wales signed for EF in 2022, until that iteration of the team folded and she moved across to Canyon-SRAM, immediately hitting the ground running with solid results in one-day races. Towards the end of last year – after a few months out – Bäckstedt impressed at the Simac Ladies Tour. There, she claimed the opening time-trial and finished third overall, her first GC podium at this level. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After defending her under-23 world title at the World Cyclocross Championships, Bäckstedt will likely return to road racing at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\">spring Classics</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+4\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Alice Towers (Canyon-SRAM-Zondacrypto)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-11-970x647.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-11-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-11-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-11-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-11-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-11-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-11-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-11-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-11-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-11-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-11.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>22-year-old Alice Towers has packed a lot into her brief time on the WorldTour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After winning the British championships in 2022, Towers was swept up by Canyon-SRAM and she made her Tour de France Femmes debut that year, supporting the GC interests of Polish leader Kasia Niewiadoma.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towers started 2024 in strong form, reaching the top ten of the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race. This caught the attention of her team who sent her to both the Giro and the Tour, and in the latter she was part of the winning team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another Classics programme looks to be on the cards and she is also likely to start at least one Grand Tour in 2025. Fingers crossed it’ll be the Tour de France Femmes.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/british-worldtour-riders-men\">Meet the 34 British riders in the men’s WorldTour in 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/promotion-relegation-uci-rankings-women\">Promotions and relegations: Which teams are in danger in the Women’s UCI WorldTour rankings?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/womens-worldtour-preview-2025\">What to expect from every Women’s WorldTour team in 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pfeiffer-georgi-profile\">‘I’d love to win a Classic in the spring’: Pfeiffer Georgi profile</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cat-ferguson-interview\">‘I’m just excited to race my bike for a living’: Cat Ferguson interview</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Millie Couzens (Fenix-Deceuninck)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2160997265-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"BRESCIA, ITALY - JULY 07: Millie Couzens of The United Kingdom and Team Fenix-Deceuninck sprints during the 35th Giro d'Italia Women 2024, Stage 1 a 15.7km individual time trial stage from Brescia to Brescia / #UCIWWT / on July 07, 2024 in Brescia, Italy.

After a year spent with the squad in 2022, Perkins jumped across to Fenix-Deceuninck’s Development Team in time for the 2023 season, during which she would light up the under-23 calendar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following a promotion to Fenix’s pro team, she made a strong impression at the Vuelta Femenina, where she finished eighth and sixth in two sprint finishes, even winning the best young rider’s prize on Stage 3. She carried this form into the Tour of Britain where she cracked the top ten on two occasions while racing for the British national team. To add, her late-season form also guided her to a set of solid results in the block of Classics in the autumn period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, Perkins has been off to a good start. She has two stage races under her belt, and will soon start her one-day programme at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fun fact: she once appeared in an episode of the BBC’s <em>Songs of Praise</em> in 2021. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lizzie Deignan (Lidl-Trek)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2161136610-min-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"lizzie deignan paris 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2161136610-min-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2161136610-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2161136610-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2161136610-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2161136610-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2161136610-min-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2161136610-min-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2161136610-min-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2161136610-min-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2161136610-min-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Luc Claessen/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lizzie Deignan has been a flag bearer for British cycling for more than a decade. Beginning her career on the track as a world champion, Deignan transitioned onto the road in the early 2010s, sweeping up GC titles at several second-tier races before a career-defining silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She’d continue this upward trajectory through the mid-2010s while riding for the Boels-Dolmans squad (now SD Worx). She made the podium at the Trofeo Binda, Tour of Flanders and La Flèche Wallonne in 2014. The following year, she’d take a step up by winning the Trofeo Binda, GP Plouay and the World Championships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As world champ, Deignan enjoyed her best season, winning Strade Bianche, the Tour of Flanders, Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Trofeo Binda and the Tour of Britain. In the following years, she continued to reign as one of the most accomplished riders in the women’s sport, adding Paris-Roubaix, Liège-Bastogne-Liège and La Course to a stellar list of achievements. During her decade at the top of the sport, she ticked almost every box on the Classics bucket list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2025 will be Deignan’s last season as a professional, as she’s set to retire at the end of the year as probably the most decorated rider in the history of women’s cycling in the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/lizzie-deignan-cyclist\">our Q&amp;A with Lizzie Deignan</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Anna Henderson (Lidl-Trek)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-770-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-770-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-770-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-770-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-770-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-770-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-770-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-770-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-770-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-770-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-770-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Lidl Trek</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Anna Henderson was a skier to begin with and was on track to make it to the Winter Olympics before a heavy fall in 2015 forced her to spend months off the slopes. Cycling was a core part of her recovery plan and she soon pivoted to a career on two wheels rather than two skis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A strong set of domestic results at the Tour Series caught the attention of WorldTour scouts and Henderson moved to Sunweb (now Picnic-PostNL) in 2020. After switching to the yellow outfits at Visma-Lease a Bike, she claimed her first pro wins with a stage at the Elsy Jacobs Cycling Challenge and a national title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a talented time-triallist, Henderson has a respectable collection of medals to her name, including silver in the time-trial at the 2024 Olympics as well as at both the European Championships and Commonwealth Games, and two elite national titles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a successful stint at Visma-Lease a Bike, Hertfordshire-born Henderson was poached by Lidl-Trek ahead for 2025 season. This year, she’ll hope to hit the ground running in the Classics and as a leadout for Elisa Balsamo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Izzy Sharp (Lidl-Trek)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/izzy-sharp-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/izzy-sharp-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/izzy-sharp-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/izzy-sharp-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/izzy-sharp-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/izzy-sharp-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/izzy-sharp-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/izzy-sharp-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/izzy-sharp-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/izzy-sharp.jpg 1500w\" /><figcaption>Lidl-Trek</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Southampton-born Izzy Sharp claimed a formative win at Gent-Wevelgem Juniors in 2022, beating fellow Brit Cat Ferguson to the title.

She claimed two titles in the junior category, winning both the time-trial and the road race. This topped off a strong season for the 18-year-old, who claimed a host of junior GC titles and one-day victories along the way and moved up to the top level as a <em>stagiaire </em>for Movistar. In 2025 she will complete her first full calendar at the senior level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ferguson is a multi-discipline athlete, competing in cyclocross alongside her road schedule. She was part of Britain’s gold medal-winning relay team at the recent UCI Cyclocross World Championships in France. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ferguson claimed two pro wins last year while riding for Movistar’s elite team. These came at the Tour de la Semois, then the one-day race Binche-Chimay-Binche.

Three of these titles came at the UCI World Track Championships in 2024. The team pursuit title there was claimed alongside her new Movistar teammate Cat Ferguson and Visma’s new signing Imogen Wolff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a professional on the road, Lloyd has already scored some UCI points in her first two races. On debut, Lloyd finished in the top ten at the Trofeo Marratxi-Felanitx in Mallorca. She was later sent to the UAE Tour where she took a top-20 finish on the final sprint stage.

Having climbed through the ranks at DSM, the Brit won the British nationals for the first time as a senior in 2021. This kickstarted a quick rise to the upper ranks of one-day racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two years later, she crafted a cunning move off the front of an echelon to win the WorldTour Classic Brugge-De Panne. This highlighted her form in a year that saw her make the top ten of Paris-Roubaix, Strade Bianche, Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Amstel Gold and the European Championships. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024, Georgi was closely marked in the Classics. After finishing fifth at Trofeo Binda, she snuck her way onto the podium of Paris-Roubaix in the photo-finish before another impressive one-day performance at the Amstel Gold Race.

Sister to former track world champion Emily Nelson, Josie dabbled in cyclocross before turning to the road in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the pandemic, she rode for the Norwegian team Coop where she’d garner some attention for her hardy sprinting skills. At the beginning of her final year with the Scandinavian team, Nelson claimed her best WorldTour result to date with a fourth place at the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After signing for Picnic-PostNL in 2024, the West Midlands rider claimed a stage and second place overall at the Tour de Normandie. Later in the year, she’d add the British time-trial title to her growing <em>palmarès</em> before a GC bid at the Tour de l’Avenir, ultimately finishing that race in seventh overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During her second year with Picnic-PostNL, she’ll most likely focus on one-day races.

She picked up a triathlon scholarship at the University of Stirling before being diagnosed with chronic fatigue. As she recovered, she took to cycling full-time. The progress was fast from this point, and she represented the Isle of Man at the Commonwealth Games in 2022 while she was completing a Master’s degree at the University of Strathclyde. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of that year, she signed for Picnic-PostNL. Since then, Storrie has been included in Picnic-PostNL’s Grand Tour roster, featuring in two Giros and one Tour de France Femmes. The Manx rider is a <em>puncheur</em> by nature, but she’s a capable all-rounder.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Imogen Wolff (Visma-Lease a Bike)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2174110457-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2174110457-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2174110457-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2174110457-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2174110457-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2174110457-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2174110457-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2174110457-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2174110457-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2174110457-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2174110457-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yorkshire-born Imogen Wolff stormed through the junior calendar in 2024.
