After a tumultuous few weeks, Apple has apparently relented and approved Fortnite’s return to iPhones and iPads. You can <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fortnite/id6483539426\">download it through this link</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2788223/apple-could-be-in-serious-trouble-over-fortnite-rejection.html\">wrote on Tuesday</a>, Apple’s attempt to deny Fortnite’s re-entry into the App Store was met with consternation after Epic appealed to the judge who issued the ruling that forced Apple to allow links to outside payment stores. As such, Fortnite offers its V-Bucks as an in-app purchase or through the Epic Games Store, where you get 20 percent back in rewards.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/fortnite-payments.png?w=1200\" alt=\"fortnite on iPad showing external payments\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/fortnite-payments.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2420w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/fortnite-payments.png?resize=300%2C207&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/fortnite-payments.png?resize=768%2C529&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/fortnite-payments.png?resize=1200%2C827&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/fortnite-payments.png?resize=1536%2C1059&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/fortnite-payments.png?resize=2048%2C1412&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"827\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s unclear whether Fortnite will stay in the App Store or if the return is a short-lived episode in the ongoing saga. After Epic’s appeal, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ordered the Apple official “who is personally responsible for ensuring compliance” to appear at the May 27 hearing in a thinly veiled reference to possible contempt of court.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is also appealing the decision that forced it to allow links to external payment stores, so it’s possible Epic could be forced to remove the link to its own store, which would almost certainly start the war all over again. But for now, enjoy your next Battle Royale.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b3a508add6b3d1587c93126d41bf1b76e30386e8e4629dcd59418d88de5ade54","category":"Apple"}
