The Giro d’Italia kicks off proceedings from Friday 9th May in Albania and finishes on Sunday 1st June in Rome. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It brings a stacked start list with former winners in Primož Roglič, Jai Hindley, Richard Carapaz and Egan Bernal, plus young stars in Juan Ayuso, Thymen Arensman and Antonio Tiberi. But who’s going to win? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you could check out <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-predictions-2025\">our own (normally wrong) predictions</a>, here’s the sensible outlook on who’s in the running for the 108th edition of the Giro.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>The maglia rosa</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Primož Roglič (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe)</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/roglic-giro-trophy-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/roglic-giro-trophy-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/roglic-giro-trophy-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/roglic-giro-trophy-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/roglic-giro-trophy-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/roglic-giro-trophy-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/roglic-giro-trophy-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/roglic-giro-trophy-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/roglic-giro-trophy-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/roglic-giro-trophy-350x233.jpeg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/roglic-giro-trophy.jpeg 2048w\" /><figcaption>RCS</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Primož Roglič returns to Italy for the first time since winning the Trofeo Senza Fine in 2023. That year he beat Geraint Thomas by just 14 seconds, taking the pink jersey on the last opportunity. Now he’s back with a new squad in Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe and surrounded by strong teammates including 2020 Giro winner Jai Hindley, last year’s runner-up Dani Martínez and best pal Jan Tratnik.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roglič swept all classifications at the Volta a Catalunya and Juan Ayuso in the process. He’s well-primed for another run at the <em>maglia rosa</em>, but some have other ideas…</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Best result at the Giro d’Italia:</strong> 1st (2023)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+7\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'join us and discover the world's best places to ride, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates XRG)</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this being his debut, 22-year-old Ayuso has won the Giro before. Not the Giro d’Italia per se, but the Giro Next Gen in 2021, claiming the overall, mountains and youth classification alongside three stages. He heads to this start line sharing leadership duties with Adam Yates for UAE Team Emirates XRG in a squad that also brings several talented climbers in Isaac del Toro, Rafał Majka and Jay Vine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ayuso has been strong this season with victory at Tirreno-Adriatico and second place at Volta Catalunya. Despite being capable in a race against the clock, Roglič has finished higher in all time-trials they’ve both started, including at the Vuelta in 2022 and 2023 as well as the Tour in 2024. The two time-trials come fairly early in the Giro, both in the first ten days of racing with Stage 2 being 13.7km Stage 10 double the length at 28.6km.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If he does win the overall, it’ll be a long-time coming for Spain, who haven’t had a Grand Tour winner since 2015.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Best result at the Giro d’Italia: </strong>N/A</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n

Bernal claimed victory in 2021 to become the second Colombian to win after Nairo Quintana in 2014. His career has since been derailed following a life-threatening crash on a training ride in 2022 and, while it’s been a long way back, he raised his hands in the air for his first victories since the Giro by doubling up in the road race and time-trial at the Colombian National Championships this February.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things were going really well until a crash at Clasica Jaen resulted in a fractured collarbone. But as is the story of his career in recent years, he persevered to finish a respectable seventh overall at Volta a Catalunya. His experience is combined with Arensman’s promise. The 25-year-old Dutchman has had a brilliant season of stage races so far, fourth at Valenciana, third at Paris-Nice and second at Tour of the Alps. He boasts two consecutive sixth place finishes at the Giro in 2023 and 2024.
