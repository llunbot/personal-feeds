The new bike comes in at under $200, which is great for the budding BMX’er in your life. But it rocks real race geo, a rear chain tensioner, a sealed euro cartridge bottom bracket, and even a three-piece crankset with 44/16 race-ready gearing. Pretty kick-ass for the price.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I said “again” earlier because there was another time, long, long ago, where Huffy spent some real time and money in the BMX space. If I recall correctly, it was back in the mid-nineties that Huffy made a big push to be taken seriously in the BMX world. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Huffy-HX-Pro-BMX-Race-Bike-first-pic-e1742940998701.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"1088\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Huffy-HX-Pro-BMX-Race-Bike-first-pic-e1742940998701.webp\" alt=\"Huffy HX Pro BMX Race Bike first pic\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Huffy-HX-Pro-BMX-Race-Bike-first-pic-e1742940998701.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Huffy-HX-Pro-BMX-Race-Bike-first-pic-e1742940998701-297x252.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Huffy-HX-Pro-BMX-Race-Bike-first-pic-e1742940998701-120x102.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Huffy-HX-Pro-BMX-Race-Bike-first-pic-e1742940998701-768x653.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Huffy)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They even had a BMX team chock-full of some heavy-hitting pros from the scene.
