But more and more they’ve become the go-to race choice throughout the entire road season, as racers look for every possible aero advantage or Watts saving. Now, riders will pick skinsuits from the Spring Classics to summer racing Sprint stages in Grand Tours.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Progress, like the peloton, never stands still. If you don’t innovate, you get left behind. Suits are the future of racewear as the sport’s leading riders favour their supreme comfort, aerodynamics, speed and functionality.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_EF-Pro-Cycling-wind-tunnel-testing.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_EF-Pro-Cycling-wind-tunnel-testing.webp\" alt=\"Rapha Pro Team Roadsuit aero road bike racing skinsuit, EF wind tunnel testing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_EF-Pro-Cycling-wind-tunnel-testing.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_EF-Pro-Cycling-wind-tunnel-testing-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_EF-Pro-Cycling-wind-tunnel-testing-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_EF-Pro-Cycling-wind-tunnel-testing-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_EF-Pro-Cycling-wind-tunnel-testing-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_EF-Pro-Cycling-wind-tunnel-testing-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These new Rapha Pro Team Roadsuits – versions <a href=\"https://content.rapha.cc/us/en/story/the-pro-team-roadsuit\" target=\"_blank\">developed to give “race-winning speed”</a> to both their EF women’s and men’s pro athletes – reshape their previous Aero Suits for improved speed &amp; versatility.

But Rapha says the design still allows for  “easier in-race nature breaks” at the same time. The Roadsuit also gets its own low-profile, high-density, quick-wicking chamois for “enhanced comfort on the road”. And extra wide silicone leg grippers keep the shorts in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Rapha Pro Team Roadsuit – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_mens.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_mens-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"2025 Rapha Pro Team Roadsuit aero road bike racing skinsuit, mens\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_mens-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_mens-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_mens-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_mens-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_mens.webp 1800w\" /></a><figcaption>men’s</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_womens.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_womens-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"2025 Rapha Pro Team Roadsuit aero road bike racing skinsuit womens\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_womens-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_womens-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_womens-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_womens-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_womens.webp 1800w\" /></a><figcaption>women’s</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both men’s &amp; women’s all-black versions of Rapha’s new Pro Team Roadsuit sells for $420 / 335€ – in wide 6 size ranges.
