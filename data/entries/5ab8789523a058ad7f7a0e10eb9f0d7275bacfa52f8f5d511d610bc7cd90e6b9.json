For those unfamiliar with Hide My Email, it is an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a> feature available to anyone with a paid ‌iCloud‌+ plan (priced starting at $0.99 per month).\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHide My Email allows users to create unique, random email addresses that forward to a personal inbox. It's similar to a password manager for email addresses, with users able to generate random email addresses for each website or login.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAll the emails sent to the random Apple-created email address are forwarded to you so you can respond if needed, but the person on the receiving end does not see your real email address. And if you start getting spam emails from someone, you can just delete the email address and put a stop to it.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHide My Email was previously available from the ‌iCloud‌ Settings on Apple devices, but now it can also be accessed directly in the Mail app. In the Mail app when composing an email, click on the \"From\" field to see the option to generate a \"Hide My Email\" email address. Selecting this feature will generate a random email address, effectively concealing your true email address.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234\">macOS Monterey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/macos-monterey-12-1-beta-2-hide-my-email/\">Hide My Email Available in Mail App With New iOS 15.2 and macOS Monterey 12.1 Betas</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hide-my-email-available-in-mail-app-with-new-ios-15-2-and-macos-monterey-12-1-betas.2322591/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=j-fM_ELxI2Q:Pv19pWodHrQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=j-fM_ELxI2Q:Pv19pWodHrQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/j-fM_ELxI2Q\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5ab8789523a058ad7f7a0e10eb9f0d7275bacfa52f8f5d511d610bc7cd90e6b9","category":"Apple"}
