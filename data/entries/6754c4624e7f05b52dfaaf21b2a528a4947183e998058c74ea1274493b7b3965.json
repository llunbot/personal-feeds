For 2025, we answered with a showstopper: The Moots Blackbird.</p>\n<p><br />Introducing the Moots Blackbird: a bold, high-gloss showpiece built to turn heads and break the mold. Built exclusively for ENVE’s Grodeo event, the Blackbird fuses our high-performance heritage with striking visual design—and showcases just how far titanium can go when precision meets creativity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Routt_CRD_Trans_AM_Black_Magic_ENVE_08-1024x732.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"572\" /></p>\n<p>At its core is the <a href=\"https://moots.com/bikes/gravel/routt-crd/\">Routt CRD</a> chassis, our flagship gravel platform known for clean lines, fully internal routing, and that signature Moots ride feel. We spec’d it with nothing but the best:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>SRAM Red XPLR AXS drivetrain</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ENVE Gravel IN-Route Fork</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ENVE AR One-Piece Handlebar</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SES 4.5 wheels</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ENVE Hex tires—for maximum grip across mixed terrain</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Routt-CRD-Trans-AM-Black-Magic-ENVE-13-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" /></p>\n<p>But what truly sets the Blackbird apart is the finish. In collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.blackmagicpaint.com/\">Black Magic Paint</a>, we departed from our traditional anodized style and went full jet black—then layered it with subtle gold detailing that commands attention without sacrificing classs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Routt_CRD_Trans_AM_Black_Magic_ENVE_09-1024x732.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"572\" /></p>\n<p>Inspired by its namesake, the Blackbird isn’t just a bike. It’s a statement.<br />A modern American classic.<br />A tribute to speed, craftsmanship, and the relentless pursuit of the perfect ride.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Routt-CRD-Trans-AM-Black-Magic-ENVE-10-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" /><br />Want to see the Blackbird in person?
