{"title":"How to manage critical notifications on your iPhone or iPad","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2105588/critical-notifications-iphone-ipad.html","date":1698310800000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple provides a number of interrelated controls in iOS and iPadOS to ensure that an iPhone or iPad doesn’t provide an overwhelming number of notifications or accompanying sounds, or that it disturbs you when you’ve set a Focus mode to keep things quiet or suppressed. However, there may be categories of actions so important that you want to override settings. Critical Alerts, starting in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, allow you to break through the silence barrier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These Critical Alerts appear only in a few apps in which time would be of the essence, along with grabbing your attention. For instance, Apple’s new <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-check-in-iphc143bb7e9/ios&amp;xcust=1-1-2105588-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Check In feature</a> in iOS 17, which lets you send a trusted person a duration or a destination, suggests to anyone you share with that they enable Critical Alerts in Messages. This makes sense, as otherwise, you could fail to check in or arrive or have triggered Emergency SOS, and a safety partner would have no idea if they had notifications silenced.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mac911-ios-critical-alert-bordered.png?w=945\" alt=\"iOS 17 critical alerts\" width=\"709\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mac911-ios-critical-alert-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1183w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mac911-ios-critical-alert-bordered.png?resize=236%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 236w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mac911-ios-critical-alert-bordered.png?resize=768%2C976&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mac911-ios-critical-alert-bordered.png?resize=945%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 945w\" /><figcaption><p>Critical Alerts lets you choose to override settings that keep things quiet when it’s important enough to do so.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I presume Apple has to approve an app offering a Critical Alerts option–for my installed apps that offer notifications, I only see it with Messages, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://myshake.berkeley.edu/&amp;xcust=1-1-2105588-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">MyShake</a> (an earthquake-alert app), and Weather.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Notifications</em> &gt; <em>App Name</em> to see if a given app offers Critical Alerts.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enable or disable such alerts by using the <em>Critical Alerts</em> switch.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
