A performance-oriented bike with big tubes to achieve remarkable stiffness, it doesn’t sacrifice the control of the handling, thanks to a well-proven geometry. The 35 mm, 1″ chainstays, and 30.9 seatpost makes this bike very reactive while the internal butted front triangle keeps the frame between 1,300-1,400 g. Of course, all this can be tuned to the rider’s preference as Rubén builds 100% custom frames.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"889\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Rizzo_Ti-22.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Rizzo_Ti-22.jpg?w=889&amp;quality=75 889w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Rizzo_Ti-22.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"889\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Rizzo_Ti-21.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Rizzo_Ti-21.jpg?w=889&amp;quality=75 889w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Rizzo_Ti-21.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"889\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Rizzo_Ti-29.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Rizzo_Ti-29.jpg?w=889&amp;quality=75 889w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Rizzo_Ti-29.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<p>As Rubén said, “This bike is one of the very first using the reborn Columbus Hyperion tubing and the first one (after ENVE’s custom road) to use the new Chris King Aeroset 1 under that custom printed topcap. 3D printing is here to stay and it is a technology with endless possibilities, but for me, it doesn’t mean I have to use it in every single part of the bike. I want to keep my style of simplicity and craftsmanship and that is why I choose to mix tube-to-tube junctions with tube-to-parts or keep other features as straight headtubes or external lower headsets (see gravel model for reference).”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1855\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Rizzo_Ti-1.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Rizzo_Ti-1.jpg?w=1855&amp;quality=75 1855w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Rizzo_Ti-1.jpg?resize=1200,862&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Rizzo_Ti-1.jpg?resize=768,552&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Rizzo_Ti-1.jpg?resize=1536,1104&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rizzo_cycles/\" target=\"_blank\">Rizzo</a>!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/rizzo-cycles-custom-frame-2024-enve-grodeo/\">Rizzo Cycles Offers Special Deal on Custom Frame for 2024 ENVE GRODEO</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Josh Weinberg","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"b2e1160ebbce086604bc09b6d4ed4afa6edbb6c042588859db24d400667eab8d","category":"Cycling"}
