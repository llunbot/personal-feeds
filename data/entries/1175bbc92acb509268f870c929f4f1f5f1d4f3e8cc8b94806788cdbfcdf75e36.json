During the preview, we heard lots of customer feedback and used that feedback to prioritize our enhancements to the service.</p> \n<p>Today, we are announcing the general availability of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/\">Amazon Q Business</a> with many new features, including custom plugins, and a preview of Amazon Q Apps, generative AI–powered customized and sharable applications using natural language in a single step for your organization.</p> \n<p>In this blog post, I will briefly introduce the key features of Amazon Q Business with the new features now available and take a look at the features of Amazon Q Apps. Let’s get started!</p> \n<p><strong><u>Introducing Amazon Q Business</u></strong><br /> Amazon Q Business connects seamlessly to over 40 popular enterprise data sources and stores document and permission information, including <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3\">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> (Amazon S3), Microsoft 365, and Salesforce. It ensures that you access content securely with existing credentials using single sign-on, according to your permissions, and also includes enterprise-level access controls.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/04/29/2024-q-business-1-diagram-1.jpg\" width=\"2066\" height=\"1168\" /></p> \n<p>Amazon Q Business makes it easy for users to get answers to questions like company policies, products, business results, or code, using its web-based chat assistant. You can point Amazon Q Business at your enterprise data repositories, and it’ll search across all data, summarize logically, analyze trends, and engage in dialog with users.</p> \n<p>With Amazon Q Business, you can build secure and private generative AI assistants with enterprise-grade access controls at scale. You can also use administrative guardrails, document enrichment, and relevance tuning to customize and control responses that are consistent with your company’s guidelines.</p> \n<p>Here are the key features of Amazon Q Business with new features now available:</p> \n<p><strong>End-user web experience</strong><br /> With the built-in web experience, you can ask a question, receive a response, and then ask follow-up questions and add new information with in-text source citations while keeping the context from the previous answer. You can only get a response from data sources that you have access to.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/04/29/2024-q-business-2-features-1-web-3.jpg\" width=\"1400\" height=\"837\" /></p> \n<p>With general availability, we’re introducing a new content creation mode in the web experience. In this mode, Amazon Q Business does not use or access the enterprise content but instead uses generative AI models built into Amazon Q Business for creative use cases such as summarization of responses and crafting personalized emails. To use the content creation mode, you can turn off <strong>Respond from approved sources</strong> in the conversation settings.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/04/29/2024-q-business-3-new-1-content-creation-mode-3.jpg\" width=\"1400\" height=\"364\" /></p> \n<p>To learn more, visit <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/using-web-experience.html\">Using an Amazon Q Business web experience</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/customizing-web-experience.html\">Customizing an Amazon Q Business web experience</a> in the AWS documentation.</p> \n<p><strong>Pre-built data connectors and plugins</strong><br /> You can connect, index, and sync your enterprise data using over <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/connectors-list.html\">40 pre-built data connectors</a> or an <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/kendra-retriever.html\">Amazon Kendra retriever</a>, as well as web crawling or uploading your documents directly.</p> \n<p>Amazon Q Business ingests content using a built-in semantic document retriever. It also retrieves and respects permission information such as access control lists (ACLs) to allow it to manage access to the data after retrieval. When the data is ingested, your data is secured with the Service-managed key of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/kms/\">AWS Key Management Service</a> (AWS KMS).</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/04/27/2024-q-business-2-features-2-admin.jpg\" width=\"1462\" height=\"814\" /></p> \n<p>You can configure plugins to perform actions in enterprise systems, including <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/jira-plugin.html\">Jira</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/salesforce-plugin.html\">Salesforce</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/servicenow-plugin.html\">ServiceNow</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/zendesk-plugin.html\">Zendesk</a>.

Users can also search real-time data, such as time-off balances, scheduled meetings, and more.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/04/27/2024-q-business-3-new-2-custom-plugins-1.jpg\" width=\"1432\" height=\"852\" /></p> \n<p>When you choose <strong>Custom plugin</strong>, you can define an OpenAPI schema to connect your third-party application.

You can specify whether all chat responses will be generated using only enterprise data or whether your application can also use its underlying LLM to generate responses when it can’t find answers in your enterprise data. You can also block specific words.</p> \n<p>With topic-level controls, you can specify restricted topics and configure behavior rules in response to the topics, such as answering using enterprise data or blocking completely.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/04/27/2024-q-business-2-features-3-admin.jpg\" width=\"1422\" height=\"1194\" /></p> \n<p>To learn more, visit <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ko_kr/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/guardrails.html\">Admin control and guardrails</a> in the AWS documentation.</p> \n<p>You can alter document metadata or attributes and content during the document ingestion process by configuring basic logic to specify a metadata field name, select a condition, and enter or select a value and target actions, such as update or delete.

Given a file, your goal is to recommend changes to ensure that the document adheres to the highest standards of writing while preserving the author’s original intent and meaning.
