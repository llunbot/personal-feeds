This will enable users to access AAA titles with the power of NVIDIA's RTX technologies that leverage technologies like ray tracing and DLSS.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌Apple Vision Pro‌ owners will gain access to NVIDIA's extensive library of over 2,100 supported titles via the cloud, including upcoming AAA games such as <em>Avowed</em> and <em>DOOM: The Dark Ages</em>, without the need for local processing or a downloaded library. Using Safari eliminates the need for a Progressive Web App (PWA) installation, which has previously been a requirement on other Apple platforms.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGeForce NOW support on the ‌Apple Vision Pro‌ is set to debut later this month, with the rollout of GeForce NOW app version 2.0.70. Users will be able to stream games through Safari on the Vision Pro by navigating to the platform's website, <a href=\"http://play.geforcenow.com\">play.geforcenow.com</a>, once the update becomes available. In addition to the Vision Pro, GeForce NOW will soon support other mixed-reality headsets, including the Meta Quest 3 and Pico devices.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2025/\">CES 2025</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geforce-now/\">GeForce Now</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nvidia/\">Nvidia</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/07/vision-pro-to-support-geforce-now/\">Apple Vision Pro to Support NVIDIA's 'GeForce NOW' Cloud Gaming Service via Safari</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-to-support-nvidias-geforce-now-cloud-gaming-service-via-safari.2446892/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"db879c65307f4f61d199aaaf34edaae13cdedd82e0e536b1b33ab6bca322390a","category":"Apple"}
