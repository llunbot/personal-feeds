The company also expanded its integration options, allowing Claude to connect with popular third-party services.</p>\n<p>Much like Google's Deep <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/\">Research</a> (which debuted on December 11) and ChatGPT's <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/\">deep research</a> features (February 2), Anthropic <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/research\">announced</a> its own \"Research\" feature on April 15. Each can autonomously browse the web and other online sources to compile research reports in document format, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/after-24-hour-hackathon-hugging-faces-ai-research-agent-nearly-matches-openais-solution/\">open source clones</a> of the technique have debuted as well.</p>\n<p>Now, Anthropic is taking its Research feature a step further. The upgraded mode enables Claude to conduct \"deeper\" investigations across \"hundreds of internal and external sources,\" Anthropic says. When users toggle the Research button, Claude breaks down complex requests into smaller components, examines each one, and compiles a report with citations linking to original sources.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/claudes-ai-research-mode-now-runs-for-up-to-45-minutes-before-delivering-reports/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/claudes-ai-research-mode-now-runs-for-up-to-45-minutes-before-delivering-reports/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"da1ac168e7c0d5be44923c086f1d50865fd26bfc99df69e94dbf7694506328f4","category":"Tech"}
