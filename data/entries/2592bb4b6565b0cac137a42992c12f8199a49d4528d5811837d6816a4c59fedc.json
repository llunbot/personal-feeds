Google DeepMind's <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/genie-2024/home\">recently unveiled Genie model</a> (for \"GENerative Interactive Environment\") does something altogether different, converting images into \"interactive, playable environments that can be easily created, stepped into, and explored.\"</p>\n<p>DeepMind's <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/genie-2024/home\">Genie announcement page</a> shows plenty of sample GIFs of simple platform-style games generated from static starting images (children's sketches, real-world photographs, etc.) or even text prompts <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/technologies/imagen-2/\">passed through ImageGen2</a>. While those slick-looking GIFs gloss over some major current limitations that are <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15391v1.pdf\">discussed in the full research paper</a>, AI researchers are still excited about how Genie's generalizable \"foundational world modeling\" could help supercharge machine learning going forward.</p>\n<h2>Under the hood</h2>\n<p>While Genie's output looks similar at a glance to what might come from a basic 2D game engine, the model doesn't actually draw sprites and code a playable platformer in the same way a human game developer might. Instead, the system treats its starting image (or images) as frames of a video and generates a best guess at what the entire next frame (or frames) should look like when given a specific input.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007877#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007877&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2592bb4b6565b0cac137a42992c12f8199a49d4528d5811837d6816a4c59fedc","category":"Tech"}
