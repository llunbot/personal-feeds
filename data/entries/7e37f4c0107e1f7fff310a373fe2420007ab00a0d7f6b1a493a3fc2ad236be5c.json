You see, hardtails bring me back to simpler times. Times when it was not the speed you caught, the miles you crushed, nor the fanciness of the trick you could pull off that mattered. Times when the mindset was all about roaming the wilderness, searching and finding trails, and overall singular places and experiences.</p>\n<p><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-58.jpg?fit=1200,1280&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-58.jpg?w=1920&amp;quality=75 1920w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-58.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-58.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-58.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>It’s in that spirit that I’ve been running Ceci n’est pas un Club (IG: @pasunclub) since 2019: a space for riders of gravelbikes, ATBs and hardtails (with the odd fixie/tracklocross/cargo) to unite in a merry band, head out and explore the depths of the hills and forests of the greater Montreal area, pushing the limit of what urban adventure biking can be.</p>\n<p>To be fair, over the years we’ve ended up stranded in some uncharted swamp more than I like to admit, but that’s part of the game: there’s always some sort of intel to bring back home for the hivemind to process anyways. And it sure ticks the singular places and experiences checkboxes! Rad times, I tell you. Then, when winter drops, whipping out the fatbikes has proven the best way to adapt and keep the adventures rolling.</p>\n<p><img width=\"3600\" height=\"2400\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-14.jpg?fit=1200,2400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-14.jpg?w=3600&amp;quality=75 3600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-14.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-14.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-14.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-14.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-14.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>So, l had been looking for a fatbike for a while, but in true urbanite fashion, I really had nowhere to put it. My significant other and myself are sharing our humble, if ever shrinking it seems, living space with our 18 months little redhead that’s part human, part tornado. Limited storage is an understatement. Constant reinvention of one’s dwelling space and lifestyle feels more on point. Anyhow, I never expected such practical consideration to lead to such big change, and for the better.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-52.jpg?fit=1200,1280&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-52.jpg?w=1920&amp;quality=75 1920w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-52.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-52.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-52.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>When Panorama Cycles released their Torngat Ti last year, with its variable bottom bracket width and bimodal conversion kit, I was shocked at the realization that it could allow me to run both a fatbike and a hardtail off one frame. One thing lead to another, and after somehow convincing myself that acquiring a titanium bicycle was the reasonable thing to do, I would soon sell my Panorama Taïga steel hardtail, which felt like a big gamble to take as I loved it to bits. Now 6 months in, boy am I glad that I did! At this point, I also feel that I can provide valuable insight about the Torngat Ti, especially regarding it’s 29+ hardtail mode.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-25-min.jpg?fit=1200,1280&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-25-min.jpg?w=1920&amp;quality=75 1920w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-25-min.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-25-min.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-25-min.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The Torgnat Ti is the latest spin off Pano’s proven adventure fatbike platform, the Torngat. The revised iteration is now offered in titanium, as the name suggests, and comes with a bottom bracket that’s narrower than most fatbikes’, allowing a better fit for summer epics. The bike is therefore supplied with two spindles: a narrow one (Q-Factor 185mm) for mountainbiking and/or bikepacking, and a full-width one (205mm) allowing clearance for up to 27.5 x 4.5in fatbike tires. It’s offered in either 29+ hardtail or in fatbike configuration, but one can also pick the stock, plug-and-play conversion kit that enables both, given a couple of ratchet clicks. 120mm suspension and rigid carbon forks, as well as the appropriate wheelset, complete said build options.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-24-min.jpg?fit=1200,1280&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-24-min.jpg?w=1920&amp;quality=75 1920w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-24-min.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-24-min.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-24-min.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Some finer features of the Torngat Ti are sliding dropouts and a seatstay split, making it singlespeed and belt-drive system compatible right off the bat. That split is so well done, it’s hard to find even when you know what you’re looking for! Take that as a hint on the construction quality of this frame: second to none, including, but not limited to, the dual finish (polished and beadblasted), the welds, and the in-house brakes and bottom-bracket interface facing. Mounts galore and internal dropper post routing round up the features sheet nicely.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3600\" height=\"2400\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-16.jpg?fit=1200,2400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-16.jpg?w=3600&amp;quality=75 3600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-16.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-16.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-16.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-16.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-16.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>Beyond its split personality and stunning good looks, I was also vividly interested in experiencing first-hand the titanium tubing, heralded as a wonder material for bicycles making. Namely, I was hoping for an improbable combination of lightness, some level of compliance, and durability. More on this later.</p>\n<p>The progressive, yet not-so-radical geometry has certainly been another draw for me, as it meant that the Torngat Ti’s versatility would allow it to evolve from season to season and over the years, further fitting my use-case (dadbike using a Shotgun child seat, anyone?).</p>\n<p>Painting a broader picture, I could also relate to the values of environment, adventure, and community that local-to-me Panorama Cycles puts forth, not just as marketing gibberish, but with tangible actions and programs that I’ve seen them deploy over time. They’re truly great, passionate people. Full disclosure: I’ve been a big fan of them for a while now.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3600\" height=\"2400\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-18.jpg?fit=1200,2400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-18.jpg?w=3600&amp;quality=75 3600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-18.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-18.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-18.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-18.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-18.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3600\" height=\"2400\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-19.jpg?fit=1200,2400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-19.jpg?w=3600&amp;quality=75 3600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-19.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-19.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-19.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-19.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-19.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>While I can certainly appreciate the tremendous value found in the stock Torngat Ti builds that are suggested on Panorama Cycles’ website (they will be happy to assist you in the customization your componentry, too), my personal build process was to a large extent inspired by a dear friend who said to me, mulling over my search for a fatbike, and I quote: « You got to live your dream, man! » And indeed, I am.</p>\n<p>One of the most standout elements of my very own Torngat would be the prevalence of violet and purple accents to complement the unique, warm glow of the Ti tubing. Then, I opted for a selection of parts that enable a rowdier style of riding, including a set of Hope Tech 3 E4 brakes with assorted, oversized rotors. The cherry on top really is the limited edition « Nebula » finish Cane Creek Helm MK2 Air fork. With the fork set to 140mm of adjustable travel, and with an -1 degree angled headset installed, the bike rocks a fairly sendy 65 degree headtube angle (from stock 67) that I’ve found very confidence inspiring for trail riding.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3600\" height=\"2400\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-7.jpg?fit=1200,2400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-7.jpg?w=3600&amp;quality=75 3600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-7.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-7.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-7.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-7.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-7.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3600\" height=\"2400\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-5.jpg?fit=1200,2400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-5.jpg?w=3600&amp;quality=75 3600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-5.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-5.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-5.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-5.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-5.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>Another goal of mine with the build project was to achieve a great level comfort for my worn out, aging dad bod. So, on top of the frame’s built-in compliance (it’s coming, I swear), the suppleness of the Helm fork as well as the wheels and tires combination that I’ve picked contribute substantially. They are custom, in-house built wheels, lacing shallow « radially compliant », yet nigh indestructible Spank 350 Vibrocore rims (see GMBN’s video on those) to Industry Nine Hydra Hubs, wrapped in 2.6 Pirelli Scorpion tires. With the same aim, a nicely sweptback handlebar and some ESI Chunky foam grips were put on cockpit duty.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot more to it, but if you’re inclined to dive deeper into the nerdery, have a look at the full build spec that’s included at the end of the article. Note: some more finishing bits are still coming through the mail, mostly for aesthetics reasons, so keep an eye out on Panorama Cycles’ socials to keep up the date with the evolution of the steed. Yet it is already an eye-catching, very capable and comfortable ripper that’s up for just about anything.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3600\" height=\"2400\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-20.jpg?fit=1200,2400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-20.jpg?w=3600&amp;quality=75 3600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-20.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-20.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-20.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-20.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-20.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3600\" height=\"2400\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-17.jpg?fit=1200,2400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-17.jpg?w=3600&amp;quality=75 3600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-17.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-17.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-17.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-17.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-17.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>When compared to my previous, theoretically nimbler Taïga, it was to be expected that the burlier Torngat Ti build would result in substantially boosted freeriding capabilities – which it does. What wasn’t expected was to find improved climbing abilities as well. Indeed, to my own bewilderment, time and again I’ve trucked on up the most prized tech climbs that I love challenging myself with. It has unlocked new lines and terrain for me not only going down but going up as well!</p>\n<p>What’s even happening?! – I wondered at first. The most plausible explanation that I could find was that it was the titanium « wonder material » properties working their magic. The compliance and the strength of steel can be felt, which is great for tackling any kind of obstacle or feature while going down or up, but unlike steel there is also some lightness and maneuverability, both ideal for the climbs and resulting in a playful feel.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-31.jpg?fit=1200,1280&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-31.jpg?w=1920&amp;quality=75 1920w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-31.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-31.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-L.-Philipovitch-31.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>One could say that it feels light-footed; a subtle springiness that is unlike anything I’ve experienced before. Prior to getting onboard, I did get some heads up from another saavy friend. He warned me that some badly built titanium frames could so noodly, they’re basically unrideable, or so stiff that they would ride harsh as heck. Well, I do think that Pano did strike a very nice balance with their engineering for this one.

It’s so good. Circling back to its climbing abilities, I’m wondering if such dynamics might contribute to the unparalleled traction that I seem to get when climbing aboard the Torngat Ti. Anyhow.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3600\" height=\"2400\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-2.jpg?fit=1200,2400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-2.jpg?w=3600&amp;quality=75 3600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-2.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-2.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-2.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-2.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>Now is it perfect? I wish. There is really only one gripe that I have, but I can’t say that it’s too serious either: the water bottle bosses placement on the downtube are a bit on the high side. So, depending on the water bottle cage design that’s used, said placement may lead to some minor interference with the top tube when taking out a 26oz bottle, specifically. I know I switched to a Wolftooth Morse Cage (Ti, it had to be), and it became a non-issue. I also got word from the Pano team that this would be addressed.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-15.jpg?fit=1200,1280&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-15.jpg?w=1920&amp;quality=75 1920w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-15.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-15.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-15.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>And there are still a couple of compromises that you are making, having two bikes rolled into one. Namely, the peculiar spacing of the rear axle and bottom bracket is a significant constraint when spec’ing the bike up, so heads up. But you know what? Panorama Cycles will graciously take you by the hand if you’re in for a custom build, whereas if you opt for the stock builds, well then it’s already been taken care of.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3600\" height=\"2400\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-22.jpg?fit=1200,2400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-22.jpg?w=3600&amp;quality=75 3600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-22.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-22.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-22.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-22.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Credits-Louise-Philipovitch-22.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>But who am I kidding, that’s mostly nitpicking while if I had to sum up my experience with the Torngat Ti thus far, I’d rather write stuff such as: a terrific bike for so many things, or that I might just be having the time of my life riding it.
