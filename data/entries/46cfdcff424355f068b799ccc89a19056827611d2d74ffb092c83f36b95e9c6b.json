Now, as that trial <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/apples-ios-walled-garden-doesnt-break-antitrust-laws-appeals-court-affirms/\">crawls</a> through <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/supreme-court-denies-epics-request-to-open-up-app-store-payments-during-appeals/\">the appeals process</a>, Epic's legal focus is moving to the other major mobile platform holder: Google.</p>\n<p>The <em>Epic v.

Epic was ready with lawsuits to instantly respond to both moves.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1981581#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1981581&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"46cfdcff424355f068b799ccc89a19056827611d2d74ffb092c83f36b95e9c6b","category":"Tech"}
