So, as your jumping skills progress, so does the ramp. As you improve, you can increase the height of the lip as your appetite to send it higher and further grows.</p><h2>Sender Ramps Progression Range</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14052840/sender-ramps-adjustable-huck-to-flat-ramp.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14052840/sender-ramps-adjustable-huck-to-flat-ramp.jpg\" alt=\"sender ramps expert progression ramp top height\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14052840/sender-ramps-adjustable-huck-to-flat-ramp.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14052840/sender-ramps-adjustable-huck-to-flat-ramp-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14052840/sender-ramps-adjustable-huck-to-flat-ramp-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14052840/sender-ramps-adjustable-huck-to-flat-ramp-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14052840/sender-ramps-adjustable-huck-to-flat-ramp-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14052840/sender-ramps-adjustable-huck-to-flat-ramp-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The Sender Ramps Progression range comprises three ramp setups; the Rookie, Advanced and Expert Ramps. Starting small, the Rookie ramp is 90cm long, with the lip height adjustable between 20cm and 35cm. Upping the ante, the Advanced Ramp has a 1.2 metre long transition, with the lip height adjustable between 35cm and 50cm. At the top end is the Expert Ramp with a 1.5 metre long transition and a height between 50cm and 65cm.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14052845/sender-ramps-progression-ramps-adjustable-height-curvature.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14052845/sender-ramps-progression-ramps-adjustable-height-curvature.jpg\" alt=\"sender ramps progression increased lip curvature height\" width=\"1600\" height=\"2013\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14052845/sender-ramps-progression-ramps-adjustable-height-curvature.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14052845/sender-ramps-progression-ramps-adjustable-height-curvature-238x300.jpg 238w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14052845/sender-ramps-progression-ramps-adjustable-height-curvature-800x1007.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14052845/sender-ramps-progression-ramps-adjustable-height-curvature-95x120.jpg 95w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14052845/sender-ramps-progression-ramps-adjustable-height-curvature-768x966.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14052845/sender-ramps-progression-ramps-adjustable-height-curvature-1221x1536.jpg 1221w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The cool thing about these ramps is that, not only are you able to adjust the height, but also the curvature of the take off, tailoring the shape of the lip to the jump you have in mind. You can use them for hucking to flat, or double up on the ramps to build yourself a landing, too.</p><p>The ramps are about as versatile as your imagination; using the terrain around you, in combination with the ramp, you could fashion some pretty exciting step downs, step ups, and hip jumps if you were so inclined.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14053621/sender-ramp-rookie-advanced.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14053621/sender-ramp-rookie-advanced.jpg\" alt=\"sender ramp progression range rookie advanced expert\" width=\"1600\" height=\"796\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14053621/sender-ramp-rookie-advanced.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14053621/sender-ramp-rookie-advanced-297x148.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14053621/sender-ramp-rookie-advanced-800x398.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14053621/sender-ramp-rookie-advanced-120x60.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14053621/sender-ramp-rookie-advanced-768x382.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14053621/sender-ramp-rookie-advanced-1536x764.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>All the Sender Ramps get a hard wearing resin surface, said to be grippy in all conditions. Static weight limit for each of the ramps is 150 kg, but they’ve been tested successfully up to a dynamic weight limit of 450kg. The feet of the ramps are adjustable too, so you can level the ramp properly over uneven ground. The feet also have strategically positioned holes that you can slam pegs through to prevent the ramp slipping on grass.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14053328/sender-ramps-expert-progression-ramp-folded-down.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14053328/sender-ramps-expert-progression-ramp-folded-down.jpg\" alt=\"sender ramps expert progression ramp folded down\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14053328/sender-ramps-expert-progression-ramp-folded-down.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14053328/sender-ramps-expert-progression-ramp-folded-down-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14053328/sender-ramps-expert-progression-ramp-folded-down-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14053328/sender-ramps-expert-progression-ramp-folded-down-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14053328/sender-ramps-expert-progression-ramp-folded-down-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14053328/sender-ramps-expert-progression-ramp-folded-down-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>They can also be folded down, so they’re easier to transport from home. They’re pretty weighty, though.
