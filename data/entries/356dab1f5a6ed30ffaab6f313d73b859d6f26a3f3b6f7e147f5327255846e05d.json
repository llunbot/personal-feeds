This stand uses the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-connector/\">Smart Connector</a> on the back of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> for charging purposes, so it works a lot like a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> charger for an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>. The stand is plugged in at the back, and then you can simply put your ‌iPad‌ on the magnetic surface to both charge it and have it at an ideal viewing angle for work, movies, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌Smart Connector‌ provides 18W of power, and it is able to fast charge an ‌iPad‌. You can tilt the stand to any viewing angle, and rotate it around if you want to show your display to someone sitting at another desk. Both portrait and landscape mode are supported too, which means you get maximum versatility with this setup. Everything folds down, too, so you can bring it with you on the go.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/lululook-ipad-charging-stand-2.jpg\" width=\"3000\" height=\"2729\" />\r<br />\nYou'll need to provide your own charger and cable for the Charging Stand, and Lululook has a range of options, including the <a href=\"https://www.lululook.com/products/100w-usb-c-gan-charger-4-ports\">100W USB-C charger with four ports</a>. It'll charge up your ‌iPad‌, Mac, and other devices with power distributed logically depending on what you have plugged in.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you don't want the added charging capability, the <a href=\"https://www.lululook.com/products/360-rotating-foldable-magnetic-ipad-stand\">360 Rotating Foldable Magnetic Stand</a> has the same setup and feature set without the charging port at the back. It's $30 cheaper at $199, and it's available in Space Gray aluminum like the charging version.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/lululook-ipad-stand.jpg\" width=\"1500\" height=\"842\" />\r<br />\nHave a Mac and not an ‌iPad‌? Lululook makes Mac stands as well. The $70 <a href=\"https://www.lululook.com/products/foldable-laptop-stand\">360 Rotating Foldable Laptop Stand</a> can be adjusted to any angle and rotated around for screen sharing purposes. A ledge holds the MacBook safely in place, and it is able to work with any machine that's up to 16 inches in size. A heat vent at the bottom improves airflow to keep your laptop cool, and the aluminum design also dissipates heat.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/lululook-mac-stand.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"674\" />\r<br />\nLululook also has a range of other accessories created for Apple products, including <a href=\"https://www.lululook.com/collections/apple-watch-bands\">Apple Watch Bands</a>, several other <a href=\"https://www.lululook.com/collections/desk-stand\">desk stands</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lululook.com/collections/chargers\">and chargers</a> for iPhones, iPads, and Macs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/lululook-usb-c-charger.jpg\" width=\"970\" height=\"600\" />\r<br />\nWe have an 11-inch 256GB ‌iPad Pro‌ and matching Lululook Stand for one <em>MacRumors</em> reader.
