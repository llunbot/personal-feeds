Apple disputed Kiani’s \ncharacterization that nobody from Apple has reached out, saying \nthat the company has held a mediation and that a future meeting \nhas been set. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One of the most frequent questions I’ve been getting from readers this week is basically, “Why the hell hasn’t Apple paid to settle this, or just bought the entire company?” I have no idea, but the above sounds like neither side is close to settling.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/19/masimo-ceo-better-off-without\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2ae6321a539bb2fb395e30d2c370c1ce438d2c8e8ec235787c4e5a5ff3bab1b5","category":"Tech"}
