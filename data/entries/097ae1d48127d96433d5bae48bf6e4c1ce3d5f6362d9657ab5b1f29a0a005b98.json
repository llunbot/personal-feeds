Perhaps you wanted a road rout and the dirt roads are too chewed up for 28mm tires, or you want to do a gravel tour and the route is mostly pavement? This can happen for a number of reasons like outdated Google Earth images. Ride With GPS’ newest tech helps facilitate this by breaking down what surfaces your new route is made of. </p>\n<p>There are three surface type categories:<br />\n-Paved – Paved surfaces include asphalt, concrete, and chip seal. Paved surfaces are shown as a solid line.<br />\n-Unpaved – Unpaved surfaces include gravel, dirt, cobblestones and natural/unimproved trails. Unpaved surfaces are shown as a dashed line.<br />\n-Unknown – When there is insufficient data available about a surface it will show up as unknown. Unknown surfaces are shown as an outlined white line.</p>\n<p>Check out more details at <a href=\"https://ridewithgps.com/news/4930-introducing-surface-types\" target=\"_blank\">Ride With GPS</a>!</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"097ae1d48127d96433d5bae48bf6e4c1ce3d5f6362d9657ab5b1f29a0a005b98","category":"Cycling"}
