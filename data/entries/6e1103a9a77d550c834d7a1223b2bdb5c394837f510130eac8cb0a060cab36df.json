The ‌M1‌ Max chip is the highest-end Apple silicon chip available, and alongside the added performance, the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the ‌M1‌ Max chip comes with another difference — it's heavier, slightly.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/m1-max.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAs we've <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/new-16-inch-macbook-pro-vs-previous-generation/\">already highlighted</a>, the new 16-inch MacBook Pro is heavier and thicker than the previous model. The added thickness and weight come from a new chassis, more ports, and other factors. Apple's specification breakdown page for the new 16-inch MacBook Pro says that models configured with the ‌M1‌ Pro chip will weigh 4.7 pounds, or 2.1 kg, while models shipping with the ‌M1‌ Max chip will weigh 4.8 pounds or 2.2 kg. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌M1‌ Max chip is physically bigger than the ‌M1‌ Pro chip; however, the 14-inch MacBook Pro, which is also offered with the ‌M1‌ Max chip, features the same weight regardless of the chip used. A footnote on <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-14-and-16/specs/\">Apple's page</a> says that the weight difference on the larger 16-inch model between ‌M1‌ Pro and ‌M1‌ Max results from the \"configuration and manufacturing process.\" <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">13\" MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">14\" and 16\" MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2021-apple-event/\">October 2021 Apple Event</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/19/16-inch-macbook-pro-m1-pro-m1-max-weight/\">16-inch MacBook Pro With M1 Max Chip Is Marginally Heavier Than Same Model Configured With M1 Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/16-inch-macbook-pro-with-m1-max-chip-is-marginally-heavier-than-same-model-configured-with-m1-pro.2317881/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HgAaEnGctYM:odjDF02EBQY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HgAaEnGctYM:odjDF02EBQY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/HgAaEnGctYM\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6e1103a9a77d550c834d7a1223b2bdb5c394837f510130eac8cb0a060cab36df","category":"Apple"}
