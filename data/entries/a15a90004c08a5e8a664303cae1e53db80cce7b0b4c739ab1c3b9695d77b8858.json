In the last few years, the US has seen a boom in cryptocurrency mining, and the government is now trying to track exactly what that means for the consumption of electricity. While its analysis is preliminary, the Energy Information Agency (EIA) estimates that large-scale cryptocurrency operations are now <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61364\">consuming over 2 percent of the US's electricity</a>. That's roughly the equivalent of having added an additional state to the grid over just the last three years.</p>\n<h2>Follow the Megawatts</h2>\n<p>While there is some small-scale mining that goes on with personal computers and small rigs, most cryptocurrency mining has moved to large collections of specialized hardware. While this hardware can be pricy compared to personal computers, the main cost for these operations is electricity use, so the miners will tend to move to places with low electricity rates. The EIA report notes that, in the wake of a crackdown on cryptocurrency in China, a lot of that movement has involved relocation to the US, where keeping electricity prices low has generally been a policy priority.</p>\n<p>One independent estimate made by the <a href=\"https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci\">Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance</a> had the US as the home of just over 3 percent of the global bitcoin mining at the start of 2020. By the start of 2022, that figure was nearly 38 percent.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000859#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000859&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a15a90004c08a5e8a664303cae1e53db80cce7b0b4c739ab1c3b9695d77b8858","category":"Tech"}
