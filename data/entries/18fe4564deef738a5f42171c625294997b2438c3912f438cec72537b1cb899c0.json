Huawei has also launched \"Huawei Card,\" featuring a very similar model to ‌Apple Card‌ with a physical and virtual card, cashback, and other perks.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLast month, similar Chinese <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/01/apple-card-rumored-to-face-oppo-card-competitor/\">trademark filings revealed</a> that Oppo was the next Android brand looking to join the smart card market, but the news that Vivo is also planning to move into the space means that Apple is likely to face at least five Android competitors to ‌Apple Card‌ in the near future.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGiven the increasing number of smart card options from major tech companies, it is likely that VivoCard will seek to compete with cashback and software integrations, but little else is known about the company's new finance product at this early stage.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vivo/\">Vivo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/04/vivo-to-compete-with-apple-card/\">Vivo Joins Android Brands Looking to Compete With Apple Card</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/vivo-joins-android-brands-looking-to-compete-with-apple-card.2306482/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bWq38yox4_M:FBnSufbx7Dk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bWq38yox4_M:FBnSufbx7Dk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/bWq38yox4_M\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"18fe4564deef738a5f42171c625294997b2438c3912f438cec72537b1cb899c0","category":"Apple"}
