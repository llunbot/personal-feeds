The 25-year-old represented Australia at the 2024 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/olympics\" target=\"_blank\">Olympics</a> in Paris, where he won two silver medals and a bronze, but then switched to competing for Great Britain – the country of his birth – straight after the games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The organisation determined Richardson acted ‘in a way which conflicted with the values of AusCycling, the Australian National Team and the broader cycling community’. Findings include that Richardson requested a delay in the disclosure of his change until after the Olympics and that he withheld news of the move from AusCycling prior to the Games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The findings also state that before announcing his decision, he asked to take AusCycling property including a custom bike, cockpit and Olympic race suit to Great Britain, which AusCycling calls an ‘unacceptable risk to AusCycling’s intellectual property’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richardson was born in Britain but moved to Australia as a child and hence has dual nationality. After switching allegiances, Richardson was hit with a period of ineligibility that forced him out of the 2024 World Championships as well as next year’s European Championships. AusCycling revealed it had looked into a two-year racing ban but it was deemed legally unenforceable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AusCycling’s decision means Richardson can never rejoin the Australian Cycling Team, is prohibited from using resources associated with it or its partners, and is ineligible for any AusCycling awards.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n

The Italian’s <em>palmarès</em> includes the Amstel Gold Race and La Flèche Wallonne in 2022, plus stage race wins in the Tour Féminin International des Pyrénées and Tour Feminin l’Ardeche in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cavalli will be hoping her fortunes improve with a new squad, having suffered her share of bad luck over the past few years. She was hit from behind in a high-speed crash at the inaugural <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France Femmes</a> in 2022, which also impacted her 2023 season, as she need to take extra time off the bike to recover further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, Cavalli was <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-news-andre-drege\" target=\"_blank\">hit by a driver</a> near her home in Italy while training. She avoided serious injury but only managed five race days for the season.
