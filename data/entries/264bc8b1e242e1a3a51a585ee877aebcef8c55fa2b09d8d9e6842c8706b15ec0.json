All transactions are encrypted, and Apple has no information about what is purchased or the person who made the purchase.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo additional hardware or credit card machine is required‌ to use Tap to Pay on iPhone. The feature uses NFC technology to securely authenticate the contactless payments, plus the feature also supports PIN entry, which includes accessibility options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAdyen, Magnati, and Network International are the first payment platforms in the UAE to offer Tap to Pay on iPhone, which works with cards from leading payment networks, including American Express, Mastercard, and Visa.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTap to Pay on ‌‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌‌ requires ‌‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌‌ XS or newer models, and works for customers as any normal ‌‌‌‌‌Apple Pay‌‌‌‌‌ transaction would. Sellers just need to open up the app, register the sale, and present their ‌‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌‌ to the buyer, who can then use an appropriate contactless payment method.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTap to Pay on ‌iPhone‌ launched in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/08/apple-announces-tap-to-pay-iphone-feature/\">February 2022</a> in the United States, and since then, Apple has been working to expand it to additional countries.
