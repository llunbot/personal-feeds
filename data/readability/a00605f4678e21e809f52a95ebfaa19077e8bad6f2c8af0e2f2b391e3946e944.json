On the outside, the Reserve Fillmore doesn’t look too dissimilar to the Presta Valve that has seen over a century of use. Internally, it couldn’t be more different. It lacks a removable core, increasing the internal volume of the valve stem. Reserve say this makes seating a tubeless tire a lot easier due to the increased rate at which air can flow through the valve into the tire. But, that’s not all; the clever design means it’s almost impossible for the Fillmore valve to become blocked with tire sealant. Reserve say once you try one of these, you’ll never go back to Presta.</p><h2>Reserve Fillmore Tubeless Valves</h2><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/l1wqclp4u1U?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><p>The common Presta Tubeless Valve is almost guaranteed to get clogged up with sealant over time, especially if your choice of tire sealant is any good. That’s because a lot of tire sealants these days are designed to seal holes that greatly exceed the width of the Presta Valve passage; <strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F165096%2Forange-seal-regular-sealant-refill-16-fl-oz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Orange Seal</a></strong> claims ~6mm while <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RTRX6JD/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Joe’s No Flats Podium Sealant</a></strong> claims up to 10mm.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04075213/reserve-fillmore-internals-versus-presta.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04075213/reserve-fillmore-internals-versus-presta.jpg\" alt=\"reserve fillmore tubeless valve versus presta internal cutaway diagram\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04075213/reserve-fillmore-internals-versus-presta.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04075213/reserve-fillmore-internals-versus-presta-297x247.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04075213/reserve-fillmore-internals-versus-presta-800x667.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04075213/reserve-fillmore-internals-versus-presta-120x100.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04075213/reserve-fillmore-internals-versus-presta-768x640.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04075213/reserve-fillmore-internals-versus-presta-1536x1280.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The lack of a removable valve core means the inside of the stem has a much greater volume. But, it’s not the increased space that prevents clogging. That’s by virtue of the unique “pop it” design of the Reserve Fillmore Tubeless Valve, meaning it is actually sealed by a large O-Ring from the bottom. This is not the case for the standard Presta Valve, which is sealed via a much smaller O-Ring at the base of the valve core. On the Fillmore Valve, the airflow hole is much larger and thus better protected from sealant.</p><div id=\"attachment_277379\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04073035/reserve-fillmore-tubeless-valve-sealant-injection-stans-injector.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-277379\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04073035/reserve-fillmore-tubeless-valve-sealant-injection-stans-injector.jpg\" alt=\"reserve fillmore tubeless sealant injection\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04073035/reserve-fillmore-tubeless-valve-sealant-injection-stans-injector.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04073035/reserve-fillmore-tubeless-valve-sealant-injection-stans-injector-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04073035/reserve-fillmore-tubeless-valve-sealant-injection-stans-injector-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04073035/reserve-fillmore-tubeless-valve-sealant-injection-stans-injector-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04073035/reserve-fillmore-tubeless-valve-sealant-injection-stans-injector-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04073035/reserve-fillmore-tubeless-valve-sealant-injection-stans-injector-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-277379\">The Reserve Fillmore Valve is compatible with sealant injectors such as <strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F842502%2Fstans-notubes-tire-sealant-injector-2-oz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stan’s The Injector</a></strong> shown here</p></div><p>The only opportunity for the Fillmore valve to clog with sealant is if you go for the direct injection method, rather than filling the tire with sealant before popping the second bead onto the rim.

Well, that’s not strictly true. I’ve been able to seat many 27.5″ tires onto 30mm rims using the Presta Valve with the core still in pace. That said, it does become more bothersome the higher the tire volume gets, especially on 29″ wheels.
