AT&amp;T will continue to sell two other \"unlimited\" plans that can be put into a slow lane.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T advertises three \"unlimited\" plans, each with different limits. The Unlimited Elite plan's advertised price is $85 per month for one line, while AT&amp;T's \"Unlimited Extra\" plan is $75, and the \"Unlimited Starter\" plan is $65.</p>\n<p>None of those plans come with unlimited data of the high-speed variety, but that will change this week. In a <a href=\"https://about.att.com/story/2021/att_unlimited_elite.html\">press release</a> that says customers will soon be able to \"stay in the fast lane with unlimited high-speed data,\" AT&amp;T said that purchasers of the priciest plan \"will now enjoy AT&amp;T's high-speed data regardless of how much data they've used.\" AT&amp;T said it will \"start rolling out this enhancement this week and Elite customers everywhere will soon receive a text notifying them when the benefit has been added.\" While the change will be made with no extra fees for people who already buy the most expensive plan, other people will have to pay more to get onto the only plan with AT&amp;T's new \"fast lane\" perk.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1779818#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1779818&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fccd3ab40088e73352135ccbda07574b03ef2289a1a0d57550801eb168641c08","category":"Tech"}
