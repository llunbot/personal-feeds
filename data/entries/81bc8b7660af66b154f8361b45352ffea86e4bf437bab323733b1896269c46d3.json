When these tools malfunctioned in macOS 15.2, it directly impacted SuperDuper's ability to create bootable backups.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"macOS 15.3 is now out, and with it, a fix for the broken replicator,\" Nanian wrote on his <a href=\"https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/happy_new_fix/\">Shirt Pocket Watch blog</a>. \"As such, macOS copying will work again with 'Erase, then copy' backups.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, Nanian cautions that while the specific replicator bug has been fixed, this doesn't guarantee that booting from backup copies will work in all situations. This is largely due to changes that Apple has made in macOS and recent Mac hardware in the name of enhanced security.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor example, Apple Silicon Macs require that the internal SSD remains functional for external booting to work, meaning a Mac with a failed internal drive <a href=\"https://eclecticlight.co/2021/01/14/m1-macs-radically-change-boot-and-recovery/\">won't boot</a> from a SuperDuper backup, even if the backup itself is perfectly intact. <br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/05/macos-15-3-fixes-superduper-bootable-backups/\">macOS Sequoia 15.3 Fixes SuperDuper Bootable Backups Bug</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-sequoia-15-3-fixes-superduper-bootable-backups-bug.2448823/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"81bc8b7660af66b154f8361b45352ffea86e4bf437bab323733b1896269c46d3","category":"Apple"}
