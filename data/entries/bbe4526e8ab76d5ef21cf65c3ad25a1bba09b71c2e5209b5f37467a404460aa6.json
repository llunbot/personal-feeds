However, there are a few things Gurman believes Apple will not compromise on: \r<br />\n<blockquote>\"The external screen, known as EyeSight, to show a wearer's eyes, as well as the eye- and hand-tracking system, are as core to the Apple Vision as a touchscreen is to an iPhone. I would expect a cheaper model to keep those features.\"</blockquote>Speculating on headset rumors before Apple unveiled Vision Pro, some commentators <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/18/gurman-headset-recap\">suggested</a> it would make no sense to add the financial cost of an outward-facing display to the already expensive device and sap its battery life even quicker, but Apple clearly regards the EyeSight feature as a key differentiator from enclosed AR/VR headsets, and the one that allows users to feel like they remain in touch with other people. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAchieving cheaper material costs in other areas, combined with a more streamlined production process, could allow Apple to reduce the price of the headset by several hundred dollars, according to Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's plan to release a cheaper version of its \"spatial computing\" headset was first reported in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/17/apple-cheaper-ar-vr-headset/\">January</a> by <em><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/17/apple-cheaper-ar-vr-headset/\">The Information</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/apple-postpones-ar-glasses-plans-cheaper-mixed-reality-headset\">Bloomberg</a></em>.
