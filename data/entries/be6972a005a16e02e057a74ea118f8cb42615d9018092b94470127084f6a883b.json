For comparison, the iPhone 14 Pro’s bezel measurements are 2.17mm, while the Samsung Galaxy Ultra S23 bezels measure in at 1.95mm.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/unbox-therapy-15-buttons.jpg\" alt width=\"2842\" height=\"1572\" />\r<br />\nUnbox Therapy's replica includes the button configuration on the new Pro models as they were originally rumored, with  a single unified volume button and an additional software-configurable button in lieu of the mute switch, suggesting the mockup was based on early schematics. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs rumors stand, the mute switch is still gone but the volume buttons are now believed to be separate on the iPhone 15 Pro models, while the rumored solid-state haptic volume buttons and new Taptic Engine have apparently been delayed until next year's models, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/gurman-iphone-16-pro-haptic-buttons/\">according to <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's new iPhone 15 series is expected to be launched in September as usual.
