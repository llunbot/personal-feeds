So to inspire more women to feel confident on the bike, they developed a more inclusive and often times more modest, range of warm weather performance women’s cycling gear. Yes, it includes the first-ever cycling-specific hijab. But there’s also some more common clothing items seen in activewear off the bike. Like a new skort with a premium cycling chamois (<em>and cargo pocket</em>) inside. And an extended long jersey and padded long pants that simply deliver extra coverage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rapha ‘<em>This is How We Ride</em>‘ inclusive women’s cycling kit</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_inspire-more-women-to-ride.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_inspire-more-women-to-ride.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rapha Women's Inclusive Cycling Kit, &quot;This is How We Ride&quot;\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_inspire-more-women-to-ride.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_inspire-more-women-to-ride-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_inspire-more-women-to-ride-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_inspire-more-women-to-ride-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_inspire-more-women-to-ride-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_inspire-more-women-to-ride-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_inspire-more-women-to-ride-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Rapha)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rapha’s new women’s cycling clothing collection is “designed by women riders for women riders”.

Rapha is determined to help change that narrative and strives to create cycling apparel that makes all riders feel empowered, comfortable and confident. <br /><br />Designed from the ground up by an all-female team, Rapha Women is a new and expanded range of women’s riding apparel developed through years of research. The result is a range of all-new and unique silhouettes, including the Women’s Padded Skort, Women’s Rapha Wind Gilet, Women’s Rapha Jersey, Women’s Rapha Wind Jacket, Women’s Cropped Cargo Top and Women’s Regular Cargo Shorts, to offer more options for self-expression to women on the bike.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_this-is-how-we-ride.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_this-is-how-we-ride.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rapha Women's Inclusive Cycling Kit, making women more comfortable riding bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_this-is-how-we-ride.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_this-is-how-we-ride-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_this-is-how-we-ride-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_this-is-how-we-ride-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_this-is-how-we-ride-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This new Rapha Women launch is a continuation of the British brand’s “commitment to further promote and grow women’s cycling”.

The $135 / 125€ Long Jersey in 6 sizes and mushroom gray or black, is simply a longer cut extending past the hips. It features a half zip, backed by a mesh panel for ventilation without exposing skin. Then, new Rapha Women’s Padded Riding Trousers are $240 / 222€ technical long cycling pants in 3 colors. With a slightly loose but tailored on-the-bike fit, they promise comfort, full range of pedaling movement, and a bit of water-repellant weather protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_jersey-gilet-wind-vest-and-jacket.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_jersey-gilet-wind-vest-and-jacket.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rapha Women's Inclusive Cycling Kit: new jersey, gilet vest &amp; wind jacket\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_jersey-gilet-wind-vest-and-jacket.jpg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_jersey-gilet-wind-vest-and-jacket-297x143.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_jersey-gilet-wind-vest-and-jacket-1536x737.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_jersey-gilet-wind-vest-and-jacket-120x58.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_jersey-gilet-wind-vest-and-jacket-768x369.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Rapha-Womens-Inclusive-Cycling-Kit_jersey-gilet-wind-vest-and-jacket-2048x983.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest $120/ 115€ Rapha Women’s Jersey comes in jeweled blue, sea green, or black.
