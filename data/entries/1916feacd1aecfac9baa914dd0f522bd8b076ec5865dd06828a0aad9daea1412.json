The third-generation ‌iPhone SE‌, which launched in March 2022, experienced a significant drop in resale value, losing 42.6% within the first month post-launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis depreciation rate contrasts starkly with that of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>, which only saw an 18.7% decrease in the same time frame. The ‌iPhone 13‌'s value stabilized after three months, a resilience not seen in the third-generation ‌iPhone SE‌, which continued to depreciate. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> and 15 models have also demonstrated stronger value retention compared to the third-generation ‌iPhone SE‌, further illustrating the gap between Apple's budget and flagship lines.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThese trends suggest that, despite a host of rumored upgrades, the fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ may still face steeper depreciation than Apple's higher-end models. This pattern of value loss might discourage some consumers from investing in the next-generation ‌iPhone SE‌, particularly those who prioritize resale value in their purchase decision.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe faster depreciation rate of the ‌iPhone SE‌ could be attributed to several factors, including the perception of these devices as entry-level options, technological advancements that make models that use older technologies obsolete more rapidly, and consumer preference for high-end features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ is rumored to feature an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 14-like design with a 6.1-inch OLED display, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a> instead of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a>, a USB-C port, an Action button, and an all-screen look that does away with the Home Button. It is expected to launch in 2025.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sellcell/\">SellCell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-se-4/\">iPhone SE 4</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/iphone-se-4-expected-to-depreciate-heavily/\">iPhone SE 4 Expected to Depreciate Heavily</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-expected-to-depreciate-heavily.2421724/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1916feacd1aecfac9baa914dd0f522bd8b076ec5865dd06828a0aad9daea1412","category":"Apple"}
