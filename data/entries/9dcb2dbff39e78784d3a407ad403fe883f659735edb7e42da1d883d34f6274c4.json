However, Apple Intelligence features are still not available for testing in the third beta of iOS 18, released this week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDuring its WWDC keynote last month, Apple said that some Apple Intelligence features would be available to try \"this summer,\" but it did not provide a specific timeframe. The features will be available in U.S. English only at launch, and they require an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max, or a Mac or iPad equipped with an M1 chip or newer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Intelligence will be able to summarize text, prioritize notifications and emails, and generate custom emoji and images, while the technology will also power a smarter version of Siri with richer language understanding, deeper per-app controls, on-screen awareness, and more. Apple said some of the features, along with support for additional languages and software platforms, will be added \"over the course of the next year.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 18 should be widely released in September. Even then, the initial Apple Intelligence features will still be considered a \"preview\" for all users.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/ios-18-beta-3-simulator-apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence Settings Visible in iOS 18 Beta 3 Simulator, But Features Still Not Available</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-settings-visible-in-ios-18-beta-3-simulator-but-features-still-not-available.2431073/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9dcb2dbff39e78784d3a407ad403fe883f659735edb7e42da1d883d34f6274c4","category":"Apple"}
