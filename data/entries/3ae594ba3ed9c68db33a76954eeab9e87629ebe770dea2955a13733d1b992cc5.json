The H3's upper stage failed to ignite a few minutes after liftoff, causing the rocket and its Earth observation payload to crash into the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p>Officials in the Japanese government are already plotting the replacement for the H3 rocket, which had a goal of cutting in half the cost per launch of the H-2A launcher, a workhorse for Japan's space program. But the H3 is based on a single-use, expendable design, like nearly all legacy rockets. The H3 design aims to achieve these cost savings through modernized manufacturing techniques and commonality in hardware with Japan's smaller Epsilon rocket family.</p>\n<p>The Japanese government updated its <a href=\"https://www8.cao.go.jp/space/plan/keikaku.html\">basic plan on space policy</a> in June with language endorsing the development of a reusable rocket to follow the H3. Now, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has tapped Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for joint studies on the next-generation launcher, which would have a recoverable and reusable first-stage booster, <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/japan-conducting-studies-for-reusable-next-gen-rocket/\">Space News reported</a> this week.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973400#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973400&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3ae594ba3ed9c68db33a76954eeab9e87629ebe770dea2955a13733d1b992cc5","category":"Tech"}
