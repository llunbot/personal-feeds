Although the US space agency has not made any public announcements yet, a source told Ars that the plucky flying vehicle had an accident on its last flight and broke one of its blades. It will not fly anymore.</p>\n<p>When it launched to Mars more than three years ago, the small <em>Ingenuity</em> helicopter was an experimental mission, a challenge to NASA engineers to see if they could devise and build a vehicle that could make a powered flight on another world.</p>\n<p>This was especially difficulty on Mars, which has a very thin atmosphere, with a pressure of less than 1 percent that of Earth's. The solution they landed on was a very light 4-lb helicopter with four blades. It was hoped that<em> Ingenuity</em> would make a handful of flights and provide NASA with some valuable testing data.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1999073#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1999073&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"03fa90a3e3827767f06068e3da9e8a273f755ed2f0375a257bc06a8ac1622d38","category":"Tech"}
