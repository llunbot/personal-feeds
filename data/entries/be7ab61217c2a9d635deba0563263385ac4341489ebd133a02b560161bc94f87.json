The road season is finally underway, with Sarah Gigante (AG Insurance-Soudal) victorious at the Women’s Tour Down Under. Stevie Williams (Israel-Premier Tech) won the men’s edition of the race, facing stiff competition from Isaac del Toro (<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\">UAE Team Emirates</a>) and Jhonatan Narváez (<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ineos-grenadiers\" target=\"_blank\">Ineos Grenadiers</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s before we get into the triumphs of Sam Welsford (<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/bora-hansgrohe\" target=\"_blank\">Bora-Hansgrohe</a>) and Oscar Onley (DSM-Firmenich-PostNL). I won’t spoil it for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, Magdeleine Vallieres (EF Education-Cannondale) secured her maiden victory at the Trofeo Palma Femina in a heartwarming moment of pure happiness. At the Benidorm World Cup, Visma-Lease a Bike thrived with Fem van Empel winning her <em>15th</em><strong> </strong>race of the season. You read that right. Her 15th. Wout van Aert claimed his first win in his final race of the CX season in remarkable fashion, which we’ll get into now…</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n

Visma-Lease a Bike’s Fem van Empel, Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) has been dominant this cyclocross season, winning ten straight races while Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) appeared not to be in his best form. This weekend in Benidorm marked the final race in Van Aert’s CX calendar this season as he’s switching back to the road to meet with his Visma-Lease a Bike team at their next training camp. But boy, did he make it a spectacle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Aert stuck to a front group comprised of Van der Poel, Michael Vanthourenhout (Pauwels Sauzen-Bingoal) and Tom Pidcock (Ineos Grenadiers), the latter later being dropped. Van der Poel crashed into a pole and despite fighting to try and get back in contention, he couldn’t catch Van Aert at the front, who left Vanthourenhout behind after powering away on the straight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just moments before, in the final few hundred metres and just as the timer kicked past the hour mark of racing, Van Aert hit the ground, tumbling over while trying to remount after hopping the barriers. He scrambled, kicking his saddle off in the process. Vanthourenhout closed in but it was too late – Van Aert standing up to raise his arms in glory after a suddenly frantic last lap. Victorious in the final race of his CX season (and the best one yet, in my opinion).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking after, Van Aert said, ‘I saw the number 13 and thought, “it’s my day”. There was still some bad luck involved, but I kept going and that’s the way I like it. I felt quite strong today… it’s unfortunate it didn’t come down to a battle.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dave Brailsford leaves Ineos Grenadiers</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"364\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/dave-brailsford-ineos-970x364.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Ineos Grenadiers</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave Brailsford, who co-founded the Ineos Grenadiers as Team Sky in 2009, has stepped down from his role with the team. It follows Ineos CEO Jim Ratcliffe’s acquisition of a 25% stake in Manchester United last month, after which Brailsford was appointed to the United board. <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cycling/2024/01/20/sir-dave-brailsford-quits-ineos-grenadiers-man-utd-rebuild/\" target=\"_blank\">Telegraph Sport </a>reported that on Friday night Brailsford was removed from the ‘team principal’ page on Ineos Grenadiers’ website, while <a href=\"https://www.globalcyclingnetwork.com/racing/news/hes-still-involved-ineos-grenadiers-downplay-impact-of-dave-brailsford-departure\" target=\"_blank\">Global Cycling Network</a> said Brailsford is moving into an overarching role at Ineos Sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It marks the end of the team’s ties to the original Team Sky managerial line-up. Fellow founding member Rod Ellingworth resigned in November last year, while Fran Miller departed to become CEO of the Ineos-owned clothing brand Belstaff in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sarah Gigante climbs to first WorldTour victory at Women’s Tour Down Under</h2>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After three tough stages in the Australian sunshine, Sarah Gigante (AG Insurance-Soudal) proved she was indeed <em>gigante</em> as she blasted away to victory on Willunga Hill and won the Women’s Tour Down Under. She dropped FDJ-Suez’s Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig, who wore the ochre jersey on the final stage but struggled to hold Gigante’s wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that wasn’t enough, Gigante stayed behind to later smash the Willunga Hill Strava record in a time-trial a few days later – the men’s unsurprisingly won by Richie Porte. Normality hath resumed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been a turbulent few years for 23-year-old Gigante, suffering concussion, contracting covid and being diagnosed with myopericarditis, an inflammation of the heart and its surrounding tissue. Gigante terminated her contract with Movistar a year early by mutual consent and signed for AG Insurance-Soudal on a one-year deal over the winter. It has paid off already.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sam Welsford, Isaac Del Toro, Oscar Onley, Stevie Williams shine at Men’s Tour Down Under</h2>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Men’s Tour Down Under proved a fruitful affair for Aussie Sam Welsford of Bora-Hansgrohe, whose sprint dominance and perfect leadout from his teammates resulted in three stage victories (including one on his birthday, no less). It was also an arena in which 20-year-old Isaac del Toro (UAE Team Emirates) shone, his first WorldTour victory arriving on only his second day at the top level, when he dispatched the bunch with ease on Stage 2 and attacked for glory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Del Toro further impressed by topping the general classification standings for three stages and ultimately winning the youth classification. Not to get ahead of myself, but he is an entertaining prospect indeed and I’ll be keeping an eye on him this season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>British riders came to the fore too. Oscar Onley (DSM-Firmenich-PostNL) became the newly crowned King of Willunga Hill at just 21 years of age on Stage 5. Stevie Williams (Israel-Premier Tech) finished second on the day and became the new leader of the race with just one stage to Mount Lofty remaining. It was a close finish on Stage 6; Williams was initially distanced by Del Toro’s attack but fought back to win ahead of Ineos Grenadiers’ Jhonatan Narváez and Del Toro. Yes, Del Toro again. He’s everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See you next time for another edition of Pro Log.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2024-pro-cycling-tour-down-under\">Pro Log: Wout van Aert wins with no saddle, Dave Brailsford leaves Ineos Grenadiers, Stevie Williams and Sarah Gigante win Tour Down Under</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"be7ab61217c2a9d635deba0563263385ac4341489ebd133a02b560161bc94f87","category":"Cycling"}
