And now you can own one for a fraction of its original MSRP: <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-iphone-x-grade-a-refurbished-4&amp;xcust=1-1-2308393-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon’s Woot is selling Grade A Refurbished iPhone X for as low as $180</a> in this rare sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone X was released in 2017 alongside the iPhone 8 as a complete re-imagining of the handset. Where all other models had a home button and giant bezels around the screen, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230697/iphone-x-review.html\">iPhone X</a> introduced an “all-screen” design with the new Super Retina display with rounded corners and a thin uniform bezel around the entire edge. It was Apple’s first OLED iPhone and the first to use gesture navigation thanks to the home indicator at the bottom of the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone X was the first iPhone to use Face ID as a more secure authentication method than Touch ID and brought a new dual-camera system with optical zoom. It’s powered by the A11 processor, the first to have a Neural Engine, and has a gorgeous glass back in silver or space gray for wireless charging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple stopped selling the iPhone X in September 2018 and ended support in 2023 with the release of iOS 17. However, it still receives regular security updates and bug fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This deal is offered in either color in 64GB ($180) or 256GB ($200). Woot says it is “guaranteed to have minimal cosmetic damage, which is not noticeable when the device is held at arm’s length &amp; have successfully passed a full diagnostic test which ensures like-new functionality &amp; removal of any prior-user’s personal information. Batteries are tested to function at minimum 85% capacity.” It comes with a 1-year limited warranty from Woot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll admit that it’s probably not a phone you’ll use every day or at all, but if you’re an Apple fan, it’s a fantastic piece of history to hold onto. So go grab it before it’s gone forever.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6fafd4ab346530e8a67df4f62d11f6e45ca286e38122377deb38a7f1c49598c0","category":"Apple"}
