It also prevents senders from tracking whether you opened an email, how many times you viewed an email, and whether you forwarded the email.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/prevent-emails-from-tracking-you/\">iOS 15: How to Prevent Emails From Tracking You With Mail Privacy Protection</a></li></ul> \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe feature works by routing all content downloaded by the Mail app through multiple proxy servers to strip your IP address, and then it assigns a random IP address that corresponds to your general region, making email senders see generic information rather than specific information about you.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/mail-privacy-protection/\">legal documentation on Mail Privacy Protection</a> indicates that the feature is available for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and Mac only, but security researchers and developers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mysk_co?s=20\">Talal Haj Bakry and Tommy Mysk</a> have discovered that since the Apple Watch does not hide a recipient's IP address, it can compromise the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-15-privacy/\">overall security</a> provided by Mail Privacy Protection.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Heads-up: The mail privacy protection introduced in iOS 15 doesn't apply to the Mail app on the Apple Watch. Both the Mail app and the notification preview on the Apple Watch download remote content using your real IP address.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cybersecurity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Cybersecurity</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/iOS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#iOS</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/o0lh9rPQTd\">pic.twitter.com/o0lh9rPQTd</a></p>â€” Mysk ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª (@mysk_co) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mysk_co/status/1460345878946922498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 15, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Apple Watch downloads remote content, such as images, using the recipient's real IP address, both when receiving a Mail notification and when opening an email, meaning that even for users who have enabled Mail Privacy Protection on their â€ŒiPhoneâ€Œ, their IP address is exposed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile Mail Privacy Protection is a feature exclusive to â€ŒiOS 15â€Œ, â€ŒiPadOS 15â€Œ, and â€ŒmacOS Montereyâ€Œ, the fact that simply receiving a Mail notification on the Apple Watch can reveal a user's IP address and bypass Mail Privacy Protection on other devices seems to be an oversight and we have reached out to Apple for comment.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Update:</strong> The same security researchers have now highlighted that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> Private Relay is also unavailable on the Apple Watch, meaning that a user's IP address can be exposed when opening links in the Messages app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Heads-up Part II: iCloud Private Relay doesn't cover the Apple Watch. If you open links sent to you via iMessage on the Apple Watch, your real IP address will be exposed.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cybersecurity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Cybersecurity</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/iOS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#iOS</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/9dP3d4A0l4\">pic.twitter.com/9dP3d4A0l4</a></p>â€” Mysk ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª (@mysk_co) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mysk_co/status/1460688549867622408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 16, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nâ€ŒiCloudâ€Œ Private Relay is an Apple service that ensures Safari traffic leaving an â€ŒiPhoneâ€Œ, â€ŒiPadâ€Œ, or Mac is encrypted. It uses <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-15-privacy/\">two separate internet relays</a> to ensure that companies cannot access personal information like IP address, location, and browsing information to create a detailed profile about you. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUsers who have â€ŒiCloudâ€Œ Private Relay enabled on their other devices should be aware that their IP address is still discoverable from Apple Watch activity.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-8/\">watchOS 8 </a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-mac-tvos-watchos-programming.135\">iOS, Mac, tvOS, watchOS Programming</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/16/mail-privacy-protection-undermined-by-apple-watch/\">Mail Privacy Protection Seemingly Undermined by Apple Watch [Updated]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mail-privacy-protection-seemingly-undermined-by-apple-watch-updated.2323611/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_ghjer4biqs:If7J4nEmysk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_ghjer4biqs:If7J4nEmysk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6c22760e127af1c3dd7c714bb1c04a3ccffb74096397f250ee807b449cc21288","category":"Apple"}
