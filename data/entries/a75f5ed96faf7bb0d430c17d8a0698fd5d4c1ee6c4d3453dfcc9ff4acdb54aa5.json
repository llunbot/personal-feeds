Firefly Aerospace <a href=\"https://fireflyspace.com/news/firefly-aerospace-announces-multi-launch-agreement-with-lockheed-martin-for-25-alpha-launches/\">announced Wednesday</a> that it has signed a multi-launch agreement with Lockheed Martin for 25 launches on Firefly’s Alpha rocket through the end of this decade. This agreement commits Lockheed Martin to 15 launch reservations and 10 optional launches. Alpha will launch Lockheed Martin spacecraft into low-Earth orbit from Firefly’s facilities on the West and East Coast. The first mission will launch on Alpha flight 6, from Firefly’s SLC-2 launch site at the Vandenberg Space Force Base later this year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029281#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029281&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a75f5ed96faf7bb0d430c17d8a0698fd5d4c1ee6c4d3453dfcc9ff4acdb54aa5","category":"Tech"}
