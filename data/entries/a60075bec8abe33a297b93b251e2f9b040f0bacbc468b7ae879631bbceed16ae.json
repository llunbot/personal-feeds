All of us have found ourselves noticing our pocket is glowing, or lift our phone and assault someone in the eye with our phone’s LEDs. Unfortunately, Apple doesn’t offer a way to disable the Flashlight button (nor the Camera button) from your lock screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you find it a common annoyance, you can make a tradeoff in ease of waking your phone to avoid triggering the flashlight (or Camera app). In <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Accessibility</em> &gt; <em>Touch</em>, disable <em>Tap</em> or <em>Swipe to Wake</em>. With this option off, you need to press the side/top (standby or wake) button to activate your iPhone so you can then use a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have an iPhone 15 Pro or 15 Pro Max, you can <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207281&amp;xcust=1-1-2166869-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">set the Action button to trigger the flashlight</a>. That button requires an intentional press of about a second, making it quite difficult to trigger without meaning to. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Diane.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
