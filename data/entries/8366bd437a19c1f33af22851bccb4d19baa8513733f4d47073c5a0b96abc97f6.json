It should gently hug you, and any zips or seams – especially around the neck or under the arms – should not dig in.</p>\n<p>Length-wise, a cycling jersey should overlap a little with the top of your shorts. Too short and you risk bare patches when cycling, too long and the jersey will bunch and roll up.</p>\n<p>The pockets should sit at a suitable height for you to access when riding, with an opening that’s large enough to get your hand inside easily.</p>\n<p>Note that sizing can vary substantially between brands, and some can be much longer in the body than others, so it’s always worth checking the brand-specific size guide if ordering online, or trying the kit on in person.</p>\n<h3>What to look for in a women’s cycling jersey</h3>\n<p>Besides fit, there are several key features to consider when choosing a cycling jersey.</p>\n<h4>Materials</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Sleeve on Le Col women's jersey.\" title=\"BR_02119\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Synthetic fabrics are often used to create a soft and stretchy fit.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Most cycling jerseys will be a blend of synthetic materials, creating a soft stretchy fabric. They are commonly a polyamide/elastane blend. These jerseys are often lightweight and quick-drying.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, Merino wool or Merino blend jerseys exist. These utilise Merino wool’s natural antibacterial and insulating properties.</p>\n<p>Summer jerseys will often be constructed from lightweight synthetic fabrics and may feature mesh panels to maximise ventilation. Meanwhile, winter jerseys are long-sleeved and often fleece-lined for warmth.</p>\n<h4>Zips</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Collar and zip on Gore Distance Jersey.\" title=\"BR_02046\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Full-length zips make for easy changing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Most modern jerseys are designed with a full-length front zip for ease of changing.
