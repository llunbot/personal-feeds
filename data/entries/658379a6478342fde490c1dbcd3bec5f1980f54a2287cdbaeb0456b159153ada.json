They were around before the dinosaurs and persisted long after dinosaurs went extinct. We’ve now found they are 35 million years older than we thought they were.</p>\n<p><i>Cryptovaranoides microlanius </i>was a tiny lizard that skittered around what is now southern England during the late Triassic, around 205 million years ago. It likely snapped up insects in its razor teeth (its name means “hidden lizard, small butcher”). But it wasn’t always considered a lizard. Previously, a group of researchers who studied the first fossil of the creature, or holotype, concluded that it was an archosaur, part of a group that includes the extinct dinosaurs and pterosaurs along with extant crocodilians and birds.</p>\n<p>Now, another research team from the University of Bristol has analyzed that fossil and determined that <i>Cryptovaranoides</i> is not an archosaur but a lepidosaur, part of a larger order of reptiles that includes squamates, the reptile group that encompasses modern snakes and lizards. It is now also the oldest known squamate.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/lizards-and-snakes-are-35-million-years-older-than-we-thought/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/lizards-and-snakes-are-35-million-years-older-than-we-thought/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"658379a6478342fde490c1dbcd3bec5f1980f54a2287cdbaeb0456b159153ada","category":"Tech"}
