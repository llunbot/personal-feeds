His first term <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/08/epas-rationale-for-slicing-fuel-standards-rife-with-logical-fallacies/\">was marked</a>, among other things, by <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/04/trump-epa-sidelined-its-own-scientists-when-rewriting-fuel-economy-rules/\">attempts</a> to water down <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/03/heres-the-trump-admins-pathetic-new-fuel-efficiency-rule-for-2026/\">environmental laws and regulations</a> aimed at the auto industry.
