Bikes were made of metal, helmets were made of leather, and Marianne Martin, a 26-year-old cyclist originally from Fenton, Michigan, realized her dream of being the first American to wear the coveted yellow jersey as she pedaled across the finish line under the Arc de Triomphe and became the first American winner of the Tour de France.</p>\n<p>Two years later, Greg LeMond’s iconic victory secured his place in the history books – but not as the first American to win the Tour. That particular achievement belongs to Martin, who earned her place on the podium alongside the legendary LeMond, Laurent Fignon, and Bernard Hinault. Her name should be as well-known as these icons of the sport.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Head over to <a href=\"https://us.vitusbikes.com/blogs/stories/the-first-american-to-win-the-tour-de-france-marianne-martin\" target=\"_blank\">Vitus</a> to read more.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><span><span>﻿</span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/minipump/mini-pump-portable-tire-inflator-power-your-adventure\" target=\"_blank\">MINI PUMP, World’s Lightest Tire Inflator Pump Up In A Snap</a></h3>\n<p>We’ve shared similar devices here before but felt like anything that gets people to stop using Co2 cartridges is a good thing!

All of RUSA’s permanents and brevets have gone through a long review process to make sure they are the best places to ride your bike. Riding your bike may bring awareness to areas that you may have not thought of before; nature that is in between the parks. Riding your bike long distances helps you to be able to see a vast amount of area in a way that you cannot do otherwise.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Radavision</h3>\n<p>Stuff we see on the ‘net that causes pause…</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1400\" height=\"934\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/PeeWee.gif?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt /></p>\n<p><em>Ride in peace, PeeWee</em></p>\n<p>Paul Reubens made riding a bicycle cool for the kids of the 1980s and this scene remains one of the most iconic representations of one’s love for their bicycle.
