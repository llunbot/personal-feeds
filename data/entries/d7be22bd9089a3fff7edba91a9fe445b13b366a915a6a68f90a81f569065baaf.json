The last major piece of hardware for the rocket, the Centaur V upper stage, arrived at Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Monday. All of the qualification testing necessary for the first flight, including for the upper stage, is complete.</p>\n<p>In the coming days, Bruno said the Centaur upper stage would be integrated with the Vulcan first stage. Then, the combined vehicle will be rolled to the launch site for a fueling test known as a wet dress rehearsal in December. However, the rocket's main engines, BE-4s provided by Blue Origin, will not be fired. That's because the first stage already <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/06/vulcan-rocket-completes-critical-test-but-launch-slipping-toward-end-of-2023/\">completed this hot fire test successfully</a> in June.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984231#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984231&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d7be22bd9089a3fff7edba91a9fe445b13b366a915a6a68f90a81f569065baaf","category":"Tech"}
