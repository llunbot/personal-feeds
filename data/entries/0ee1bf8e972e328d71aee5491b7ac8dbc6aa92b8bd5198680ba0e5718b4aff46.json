The Charger is not quite ready to ditch internal combustion entirelyâ€”variants with twin-turbo V6 engines under the hood are on the way, too, but none will have the same performance as the 2024 Charger Daytona Scat Pack, which boasts an electric powertrain with 670 hp (500 kW) and a quarter-mile time of just 11.5 seconds.</p>\n<p>The two-door Charger Daytona Scat Pack goes into production later this year at Stellantis' Windsor Assembly Plant in Ontario, Canada, alongside the Charger Daytona R/T, another all-electric model with a slightly less powerful 496-hp (370 kW) powertrain. Four-door versions of the Daytona Scat Pack and R/T models go into production in early 2025, as will two- and four-door versions of the Charger SIXPACK H.O., which uses a 550-hp (410 kW) V6 gasoline engine.</p>\n<p>Built on Stellantis' <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/plug-in-jeeps-and-an-ev-ram-1500-pickup-are-part-of-stellantis-new-plan/\">new STLA Large platform</a>, the EV Charger Daytonas use a 400 V powertrain and a 100.5 kWh battery pack with a peak discharge rate of 550 kW. The electric Chargers are all-wheel drive with a pair of 335-hp (250 kW), 300 lb-ft (406 Nm) drive units. However, Dodge says there are actually six different performance levels, including the aforementioned 496-hp R/T, which uses a \"Direct Connection Stage 1 upgrade kit\" that adds 40 hp (30 kW), and the Scat Pack, which uses a \"Direct Connection Stage 2 upgrade kit\" that adds 80 hp (60 kW) extra.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007874#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007874&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
