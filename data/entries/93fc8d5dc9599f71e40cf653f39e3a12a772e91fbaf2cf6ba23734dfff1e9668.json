After analyzing data from those observations, a team of researchers, led by astronomer Charles Cadieux, of Université de Montréal, suggest that LHS 1140 b is more likely to be a super-Earth.</p>\n<p>If this planet is an alternate version of our own, its relative proximity to its cool red dwarf star means it would most likely be a gargantuan snowball or a mostly frozen body with a substellar (region closest to its star) ocean that makes it look like a cosmic eyeball. It is now thought to be the exoplanet with the best chance for liquid water on its surface, and so might even be habitable.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038095#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038095&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"93fc8d5dc9599f71e40cf653f39e3a12a772e91fbaf2cf6ba23734dfff1e9668","category":"Tech"}
