Built in 1996, the Sleipner project strips carbon dioxide from natural gas—largely made up of methane—to make it marketable. But instead of releasing the CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere, the greenhouse gas is buried.</p>\n<p>The effort stores around 1 million metric tons of CO<sub>2 </sub>per year—and is praised by many as a pioneering success in global attempts to cut greenhouse gas emissions.</p>\n<p>Last year, total global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions hit an all-time high of around 35.8 billion tons, or gigatons. At these levels, scientists estimate, we have roughly six years left before we emit so much CO<sub>2</sub> that global warming will consistently exceed 1.5° Celsius above average preindustrial temperatures, an internationally agreed-upon limit. (Notably, the <a href=\"https://climate.copernicus.eu/surface-air-temperature-june-2024\">global average temperature</a> for the past 12 months has exceeded this threshold.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036280#p3\">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036280&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Knowable Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cb50c6d5a9d3f7ffa3654e2fd244e6dfda179d73906e7dfd703de427d3e84bd5","category":"Tech"}
