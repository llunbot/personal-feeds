New multitasking controls make it easier to launch and control multiple concurrent apps. Notifications have been redesigned, and a new notification summary view attempts to show notifications that are most relevant at a given time.</p>\n<p>The new features tie in closely with Focus, which gives you the ability to create profiles for work, family time, gaming, or other categories.
