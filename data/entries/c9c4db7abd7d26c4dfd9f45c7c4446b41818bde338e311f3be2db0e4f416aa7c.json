Engineering and construction firms were least likely to anticipate cuts because of automation, alongside technology companies.</p>\n<p>Some 46 percent of those surveyed said they expect the use of generative AI—systems that can spew out humanlike text, images, and code in seconds—to boost profitability in the next 12 months, the survey added. However, 47 percent said the technology will deliver little or no change.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996235#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996235&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Financial Times","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c9c4db7abd7d26c4dfd9f45c7c4446b41818bde338e311f3be2db0e4f416aa7c","category":"Tech"}
