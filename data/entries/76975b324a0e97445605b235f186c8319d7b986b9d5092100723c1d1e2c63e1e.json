Based on similar experiences while skiing, I immediately recognized that this invariably meant very bad things. A few seconds later, as I was brushing dirt out of the abrasions I had just picked up, I contemplated where I had gone wrong.</p>\n<p>Once again, I had misunderstood <a href=\"https://hpcbikes.com/pages/trailblazer-landing-page\">HPC's Trailblazer e-mountain bike</a>. Doing so had become a feature of the time I spent using the bike.</p>\n<p>The Trailblazer looks like a solid, hefty beast of a bike (that's not an insult—I got compliments on its looks while taking a train to some trails). It's covered with components that are likely to be unfamiliar to people who know the default sets that come with bikes from large manufacturers. But if you do some research on the components, you realize that the Trailblazer was specced by someone with deep knowledge and fairly particular tastes. And the ride the bike provided has some surprisingly subtle qualities that took me a while to adjust to.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011071#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011071&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"76975b324a0e97445605b235f186c8319d7b986b9d5092100723c1d1e2c63e1e","category":"Tech"}
