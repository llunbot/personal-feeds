They offer a more secure and convenient alternative to traditional passwords, allowing users to sign in to apps and websites in the same way they unlock their devices: With a fingerprint, a face scan, or a passcode. Passkeys are also resistant to online attacks like phishing, making them more secure than things like SMS one-time codes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe draft specifications, called Credential Exchange Protocol (CXP) and Credential Exchange Format (CXF), will standardize the secure transfer of credentials across different providers. This addresses a current limitation where passkeys are often tied to specific ecosystems or password managers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor Apple users, the development could significantly enhance the utility of passkeys across their devices and services. Once implemented, users may be able to securely move their passkeys between Apple's built-in password management system and third-party password managers, and event to non-Apple platforms. It's worth noting that the new specifications are currently open for community review and feedback, so it could be a while before we see them implemented and the specifications could change in the meantime.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/passkeys/\">Passkeys</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/fido-alliance-portable-passkeys-across-platforms/\">FIDO Alliance Working on Making Passkeys Portable Across Platforms</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/fido-alliance-working-on-making-passkeys-portable-across-platforms.2440108/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"094d98a3db3dead59c1ba068be2be1a0cae045b93486696f28982069b8db9f6b","category":"Apple"}
