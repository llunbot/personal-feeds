Some forensic scientists use the life cycle of blow flies, which seek out and lay eggs on corpses. But there’s a lot of variability between fly species and seasonal effects, so it would be helpful to develop new methods.</p>\n<p>It turns out that studying the microbes that flourish in decomposing corpses can provide helpful clues. Forensic scientists have now identified some 20 microbes they believe constitute a kind of universal network driving the decomposition of dead animal flesh, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01580-y\">new paper</a> published in the journal Nature Microbiology.</p>\n<p>“One of the principal questions of any death investigation is ‘when did this person die?’” <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1033971?\">said Nancy La Vigne</a>, director of the National Institute of Justice, which funded the research. “This continuing line of NIJ-funded research is showing promising results for predicting time of death of human remains, aiding in identification of the decedent, determining potential suspects, and confirmation or refutation of alibis.” </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002612#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002612&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"965aea288fdf02617c320288045dbfd929eea9142b02fb38dfd2e2c622f226bc","category":"Tech"}
