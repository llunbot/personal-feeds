{"title":"New Amazon EC2 C7gn Instances: Graviton3E Processors and Up To 200 Gbps Network Bandwidth","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-c7gn-instances-graviton3e-processors-and-up-to-200-gbps-network-bandwidth/","date":1687293370000,"content":"<p>The <strong>C7gn</strong> instances that we <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-instance-types-in-the-works-c7gn-r7iz-and-hpc7g/\">previewed</a> last year are now available and you can start using them today. The instances are designed for your most demanding network-intensive workloads (firewalls, virtual routers, load balancers, and so forth), data analytics, and tightly-coupled cluster computing jobs. They are powered by AWS Graviton3E processors and support up to 200 Gbps of network bandwidth.</p> \n<p>Here are the specs:</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>Instance Name</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>vCPUs<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Memory<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Network Bandwidth<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>EBS Bandwidth<br /> </strong></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c7gn.medium</strong></td> \n   <td>1</td> \n   <td>2 GiB</td> \n   <td>up to 25 Gbps</td> \n   <td>up to 10 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c7gn.large</strong></td> \n   <td>2</td> \n   <td>4 GiB</td> \n   <td>up to 30 Gbps</td> \n   <td>up to 10 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c7gn.xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>4</td> \n   <td>8 GiB</td> \n   <td>up to 40 Gbps</td> \n   <td>up to 10 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c7gn.2xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>8</td> \n   <td>16 GiB</td> \n   <td>up to 50 Gbps</td> \n   <td>up to 10 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c7gn.4xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>16</td> \n   <td>32 GiB</td> \n   <td>50 Gbps</td> \n   <td>up to 10 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c7gn.8xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>32</td> \n   <td>64 GiB</td> \n   <td>100 Gbps</td> \n   <td>up to 20 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c7gn.12xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>48</td> \n   <td>96 GiB</td> \n   <td>150 Gbps</td> \n   <td>up to 30 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c7gn.16xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>128 GiB</td> \n   <td>200 Gbps</td> \n   <td>up to 40 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>The increased network bandwidth is made possible by the new 5th generation AWS Nitro Card. As another benefit, these instances deliver the lowest <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/efa/\">Elastic Fabric Adapter</a> (EFA) latency of any current EC2 instance.</p> \n<p>Here’s a quick infographic that shows you how the C7gn instances and the Graviton3E processors compare to previous instances and processors:<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/06/01/c7gn_v7.png\" alt width=\"1280\" height=\"864\" /></p> \n<p>As you can see, the Graviton3E processors deliver substantially higher memory bandwidth and compute performance than the Graviton2 processors, along with higher vector instruction performance than the Graviton3 processors.</p> \n<p>C7gn instances are available in the US East (Ohio, N.
