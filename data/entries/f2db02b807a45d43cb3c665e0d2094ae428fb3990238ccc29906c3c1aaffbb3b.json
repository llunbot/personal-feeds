For robots to interact more\nnaturally with humans, robot movement design should likewise\nintegrate expressive qualities — such as intention, attention,\nand emotions — alongside traditional functional considerations\nlike task fulfillment, spatial constraints, and time efficiency.\nIn this paper, we present the design and prototyping of a\nlamp-like robot that explores the interplay between functional and\nexpressive objectives in movement design.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I enjoyed seeing something Luxo-esque made real, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12493\">the paper itself</a> is fairly readable — and worth skimming at least for the illustrations. But I’ll wait for an actual product to get excited.
