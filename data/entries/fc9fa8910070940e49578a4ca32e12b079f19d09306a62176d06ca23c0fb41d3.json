The pedals are compatible with Shimano SPD-SL cleat fittings, meaning the Italian-based brand now offers power-equipped pedals for every kind of riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve been sent a pair so that we can take a first look at their functionality, and how they differ from other pedal-based power meters on the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Spindle-based design</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"640\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/newsletter_cyclist_esploso-perno.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/newsletter_cyclist_esploso-perno.webp 640w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/newsletter_cyclist_esploso-perno-300x188.webp 300w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the major inclusions in the Assioma Pro RS borrows from the design of the SPD-compatible Assioma Pro MX pedals in that the external power pod has been brought inside the pedal spindle. Not only does this significantly streamline the appearance of the pedals, creating a clean, simple silhouette, but it shields the pedals’ electronics, the strain gauges and the rechargeable battery, sealing them inside the watertight central axle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Favero says this design is preferable to the solutions used by competitors, because it negates the need for any potentially unstable connections between external batteries and internal strain gauges. The reason Favero’s solution hasn’t been universally adopted is because it is a very delicate operation to fit all the required circuitry and technology into such a confined space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the benefits are said to be considerable, with Favero claiming the more secure connection between the batteries and strain gauges means power dropouts – and therefore inaccurate readings – are far less likely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Accuracy of data</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://cycling.favero.com/en/assiomaprors?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=bloglink&amp;utm_campaign=Cyclist+Magazine+PRO+RS\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"640\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/newsletter_cyclist_App-Live.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/newsletter_cyclist_App-Live.webp 640w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/newsletter_cyclist_App-Live-300x188.webp 300w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The data produced by the Favero Assioma Pro RS pedals lies within a +/- 1% accuracy range, which stands up against other leading brands in the market. What separates the entire range of Favero Assioma power pedals from rival products is the use of the Instant Angular Velocity (IAV) power system, a measurement taken by an integrated gyroscope that detects velocity and power during every phase of the pedal stroke, rather than just estimating an average value as some pedals do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to highly accurate power readings, the Assioma Pro can record how force is exerted across the pedal platform (Platform Centre Offset), the Power Phases of each pedal stroke (PP), and how much time a rider spends seated or standing (Rider Position).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This range of data is one of the market-leading elements of the Assioma Pro’s performance. All data – except for rider position – can be tracked in real time on the Favero app which stays connected to the pedals via Bluetooth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Staying charged</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"640\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/newsletter_assioma_Lightest2.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/newsletter_assioma_Lightest2.webp 640w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/newsletter_assioma_Lightest2-300x127.webp 300w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Users need not worry about replacing batteries either. As mentioned, the spindle is totally sealed, so Favero has included an external recharging port – similar to those you might have seen on a smartwatch – with which to recharge the batteries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, moving the fragile parts to the pedal’s spindle is all well and good, so long as it doesn’t result in a battery that needs frequent recharging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Favero’s solution appears to have this eventuality covered too, with a fully charged battery delivering more than 60 hours of continuous use. In terms of battery degradation, Favero estimates that the Assioma Pro RS loses 20% of its battery capacity after 30,000 hours of use – or roughly half a million kilometres of riding. That should keep you going for a good few years!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Beyond the spindle</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"640\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/newsletter_assioma_Assioma-PRO-RS-2.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/newsletter_assioma_Assioma-PRO-RS-2.webp 640w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/newsletter_assioma_Assioma-PRO-RS-2-300x188.webp 300w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the central chamber of the pedal spindle is well protected, the pedal’s mechanical elements are located externally, and are both robust and straightforward to replace. The pedals of some competitors are difficult to disassemble and tricky to repair, even if the pedal has only sustained minor damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Assioma Pro RS has modular replacement baked into the design. If, for any reason, the pedal body is damaged, a replacement can be purchased for £50, which is around half the price some competitors charge. This low price is possible because the pedal body itself contains no electrical componentry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equally, if you’d rather attach a different compatible pedal body to the Favero Assioma spindle, that is also possible. Removal requires only standard tools and the process is described in detail on the partnering Favero Assioma app. Plus, you are not limited to road pedal bodies. Since the spindle of the Assioma Pro RS is identical to that of the off-road Assioma Pro MX, you can swap in an SPD compatible pedal body without any issue – meaning they are deeply versatile for all kinds of riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Advertorial_Cyclist_02-1-970x546.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Advertorial_Cyclist_02-1-970x546.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Advertorial_Cyclist_02-1-300x169.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Advertorial_Cyclist_02-1-768x432.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Advertorial_Cyclist_02-1-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Advertorial_Cyclist_02-1-750x422.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Advertorial_Cyclist_02-1-1140x641.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Advertorial_Cyclist_02-1.webp 1920w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>None of which is to say the Assioma pedal body can’t handle some punishment. It’s made from reinforced carbon fibre tech-polymers, which has been chosen for its strength, lightness and shock resistance. This contributes to an overall weight of just 123.5g per pedal – the lightest power-equipped pedal on the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as sticking to a Q-factor figure of 53mmm which will be in line with most riders’ preference, Favero has also taken care to maximise the sizing and tension versatility of the Assioma Pro RS pedals. It offers 28 gradations of plate tension to choose between, meaning riders can dial in an ideal cleat fit without the need to purchase separate plates. Equally, the 10.5mm stack height is notably low, minimising the distance between cleat and the centre of the spindle, which is said to improve power transfer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://cycling.favero.com/en/assiomaprors?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=bloglink&amp;utm_campaign=Cyclist+Magazine+PRO+RS\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Advertorial_Cyclist_01-1-970x546.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Advertorial_Cyclist_01-1-970x546.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Advertorial_Cyclist_01-1-300x169.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Advertorial_Cyclist_01-1-768x432.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Advertorial_Cyclist_01-1-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Advertorial_Cyclist_01-1-750x422.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Advertorial_Cyclist_01-1-1140x641.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Advertorial_Cyclist_01-1.webp 1920w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Favero Assioma Pro RS prices and details</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The versatility of the Assioma Pro RS pedals extends into its pricing options.
