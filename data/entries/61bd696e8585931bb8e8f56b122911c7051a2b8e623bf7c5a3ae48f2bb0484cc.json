New car sales were essentially flat in the region last month, with just under 1,400 more cars sold this year than last. But the market is far from static; plug-in sales are booming, with battery electric vehicle registrations up by 28 percent according to the analysts at JATO Dynamics, and plug-in hybrid EV sales increased by 31 percent. Almost every automaker has capitalized on this growth, with a few exceptionsâ€”Tesla being the most significant.</p>\n<p>As the first mainstream BEV-only brand, Tesla led the way in European EV sales and made much of the fact that its Model Y crossover was the best-selling car in Europe for some time. Those days are long gone. Model Y registrations fell by 53 percent last month to just 4,495 units, dropping it to 9th on the list of most-registered BEVs. First place went to the Skoda Elroq, followed by VW's ID.3, ID.7, ID.4, and the new Kia EV3.</p>\n<p>When you look at sales at the brand level, things get a little worse for the American automaker. Volkswagen sold more EVs than anyone else in Europe last month, increasing by 61 percent to 23,514 units. As for Tesla? It fell to 11th place, with just 7,165 sales in total, a 49 percent decrease year on year.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/tesla-crushed-in-europe-as-byd-outsells-bev-sales-surge-28/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/tesla-crushed-in-europe-as-byd-outsells-bev-sales-surge-28/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
