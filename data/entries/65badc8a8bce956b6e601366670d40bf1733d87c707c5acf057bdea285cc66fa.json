Richard and the GTFO, Glenn and the AFF, and now Bradford and his baby the <a href=\"https://www.speedvagen.com/customrando\" target=\"_blank\">Speedvagen Custom Rando</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Last summer early in the pandemic we hired Bradford Smith to build frames. While that was a crazy time to start new, he’s taking to the role exceptionally well and has been a staple in developing new ideas. His excitement for bike and riding is unlike anyone we have ever seen.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/unnamed-3.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Bradford’s riding style is just different than that of an average cyclist and he thrives in the Ultra Endurance category and cyclocross, a strange mixture on opposite ends of the spectrum. Brad is known to do some pretty wild rides like completing 1200 Km (750 miles) Paris-Brest-Paris in 48hours of moving time. Finishing the Trans America bike race in 11th place and many more long-distance adventures.</p>\n<p>The Rando is his influence and thoughts on how a bike should ride, combined with all of classic SV signature touches, seat stays, geo, materials, technology, and style.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/unnamed-4.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>The Rando</strong></p>\n<p>-Three Cerekote colors Army, Terracotta, Titanium Blue<br />\n-Custom Geo<br />\n-Custom Steel Fork<br />\n-Custom Built-in House rack.<br />\n-Ruthworks Bag<br />\n-Lighting Package featuring SON dynamo hub and Supernova E3 lights<br />\n-Painted to match Honjo fenders<br />\n-T47 BB</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Turn around time depends on when parts arrive.
