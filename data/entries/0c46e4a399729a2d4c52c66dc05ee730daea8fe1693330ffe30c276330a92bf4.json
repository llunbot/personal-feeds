That's according to Omdia analyst Hiroshi Hayase, who is cited in <a href=\"https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/nintendo-s-next-switch-coming-this-year-with-lcd-omdia-says-1.2026798\">a Bloomberg News report</a> focused on the upcoming handheld's potential effects on the market for \"amusement displays\" over the next few years.</p>\n<p>An 8-inch screen (measured diagonally) would put the Switch 2 near the extreme upper end of portable gaming screens historically. Among mass-market devices, only the recently launched <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/sonys-200-handheld-portal-can-stream-games-from-your-ps5-and-uh-thats-it/\">PlayStation Portal</a> (8-inch screen) and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/lenovo-legion-go-suggests-gaming-portables-arent-big-enough-need-a-mouse/\">Lenovo Legion Go</a> (8.8-inch screen) have broken past the 7-inch barrier for dedicated gaming handhelds.</p>\n<p>That said, the 6.2-inch screen on the original Nintendo Switch also set portable gaming records <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/nintendo-switch-review/\">when it launched in 2017</a>, easily surpassing the once-luxurious 5-inch screen of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/02/a-new-standard-in-design-in-depth-with-the-playstation-vita/\">2011's PlayStation Vita</a>. The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/switch-oled-review-nintendos-nicest-most-nonessential-upgrade-yet/\">2021 launch of the Switch OLED</a> increased the diagonal screen measurement to 7 inches, a screen size that has since become somewhat standard on subsequent portable gaming devices like the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/steam-deck-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-review/\">Steam Deck</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/the-asus-rog-ally-runs-windows-eats-battery-and-needs-time-to-cook/\">ROG Ally</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1999277#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1999277&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0c46e4a399729a2d4c52c66dc05ee730daea8fe1693330ffe30c276330a92bf4","category":"Tech"}
