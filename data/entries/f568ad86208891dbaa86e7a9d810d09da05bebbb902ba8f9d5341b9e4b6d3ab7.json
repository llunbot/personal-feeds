As much as Mac sales are growing and Apple‚Äôs push into services is increasing, iPhone sales are at the heart of the company‚Äôs portfolio and serve as the driver for accessories like Apple Watch and AirPods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro haven‚Äôt been out for very long, but rumors are already heating up about what to expect with next year‚Äôs iPhone 15 line. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve heard so far, and what we expect based on Apple‚Äôs recent history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated 03/20/23:</strong> A new set of <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1637837336158560256&amp;xcust=1-1-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">purported iPhone 15 CAD files</a> give us a closer look at the single volume button and mute button, which will appear on the Pro models only.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15 release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple usually introduces the new iPhones on a Tuesday or Wednesday around the second week of September. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, we suspect the iPhone 15 will be unveiled on September 12 or 13, 2023. At least some of the models will likely go on sale for preorder that Friday (September 15) and be available in stores the following Friday (September 22).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here‚Äôs when the last few generations arrived in stores:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>iPhone 14:</strong> September 16, 2022</li><li><strong>iPhone 13:</strong> September 24, 2021</li><li><strong>iPhone 12:</strong> October 23, 2020</li><li><strong>iPhone 11:</strong> September 20, 2019</li><li><strong>iPhone XS:</strong> September 21, 2018</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15 price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the iPhone 14 models, Apple kept the price the same in the U.S., but thanks to exchange rates and inflation, had to raise prices in the U.K. and many other countries. For reference, here‚Äôs the pricing on the iPhone 14 line:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>iPhone 14: $799/¬£849</li><li>iPhone 14 Plus: $899/¬£949</li><li>iPhone 14 Pro: $999/¬£1099</li><li>iPhone 14 Pro Max: $1099/¬£1199</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple does indeed re-brand the iPhone 15 Pro Max as the iPhone 15 Ultra (see below) and give it some exclusive new features, we think that will prove enough of an excuse to raise prices on that model, perhaps $100/¬£100. A <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/LeaksApplePro/status/1590762157712760833&amp;xcust=1-1-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">tweet by LeaksApplePro</a> in November 2022 said it expects the iPhone 15 Ultra to ‚Äúcost substantially more to manufacture than iPhone 14 Pro Max.‚Äù That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it will cost more, but it‚Äôs a good indication that it might.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>iPhone 15 Ultra will cost substantially more to manufacture than iPhone 14 Pro Max</p>‚Äî LeaksApplePro (@LeaksApplePro) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/LeaksApplePro/status/1590762157712760833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">November 10, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1444061/iphone-14-plus-sales-price-cut-rumors.html\">rumor in December</a> claimed that Apple is ‚Äúseriously‚Äù considering a price cut to the iPhone 15 Plus following disappointing sales of the iPhone 14 Plus this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15 Ultra</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that Apple has introduced the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1061837/apple-watch-ultra-display-design-sensors-battery-life.html\">Apple Watch Ultra</a>, there are rumors that the company will extend the branding to the iPhone line with the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1487037/iphone-15-ultra-design-display-camera-specs-price.html\">iPhone 15 Ultra</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That‚Äôs really about all there is to those rumors so far. The assumption is that the iPhone 15 Ultra would be the branding used for the ‚ÄúPro Max‚Äù variant, and there would be <em>some</em> sort of new features to differentiate it. Apple did this once before with the iPhone 12 Pro Max, which had a slightly better camera than the iPhone 12 Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So most people expect that the camera will once again be the feature that sets apart the new Ultra phone, possibly with a better periscope telephoto camera (see below). The rumor mill has lots of other ideas for how Apple could make the Ultra version stand out, such as faster charging or more storage, but most of them aren‚Äôt substantiated by any evidence. Wishlist features, if you will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This hypothetical iPhone 15 Ultra could otherwise be thought of as an iPhone 15 Pro Max‚Äìit is assumed to use the same processor, display, and design as the iPhone 15 Pro (though <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/LeaksApplePro/status/1583087610460717056&amp;xcust=1-1-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">LeaksApplePro reports</a> that it could have a titanium body like the Apple Watch Ultra).</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-wrist.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Watch Ultra wrist\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-wrist.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3164w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-wrist.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-wrist.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-wrist.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-wrist.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-wrist.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-wrist.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-wrist.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /><figcaption>The iPhone  15 Ultra may come in titanium like the Apple Watch Ultra.</figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15¬†design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While Apple has kept the same general design since the iPhone 12, rumors suggest that a change may be in store for the iPhone 15. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre hearing about the look of the next iPhone. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Enclosure</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1594336832078385153&amp;xcust=1-1-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">ShrimpApplePro on Twitter</a>, the iPhone 15 will feature ‚Äúa new border design.‚Äù As the leaker explains, the back edge corners will ‚Äúbe rounded and not square‚Äù like the iPhone 14. Based on the images below, it looks a bit like an updated version of the iPhone X.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>So the new iPhone 15<br />From the early information that I have, the iPhone 15 will feature a new border design. The back edge corner (as pointed out in the images) will be rounded and not square anymore. <br />The material also will be titanium. <br />Still very early to take it as it is. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/hbdCKUhVP9&amp;xcust=1-1-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/hbdCKUhVP9</a></p>‚Äî ShrimpApplePro üç§ (@VNchocoTaco) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1594336832078385153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">November 20, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We expect to see the same four general sizes: about 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch for both the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2023/02/22/exclusive-iphone-15-cads-reveal-larger-6-2-inch-display-dynamic-island-and-more/&amp;xcust=1-1-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">9to5Mac obtained CAD files</a> reported to be from the iPhone 15 enclosure, which shows a very slightly larger 6.2-inch display thanks to a slimmer bezel. The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2023/02/16/exclusive-this-is-iphone-15-pro-thinner-bezels-thicker-curve-design-no-lightning-port-more/&amp;xcust=1-1-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">iPhone 15 Pro CAD files</a> showed a similar slimmer bezel. It‚Äôs not yet known if the Max variants will also have a larger display, or if none of these iPhones will, but will have a slightly smaller enclosure instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ShrimpApple Pro says the iPhone 15 will use titanium for the first time, a rumor that we‚Äôve heard for several years. If true this time around, it‚Äôs possible that it will be exclusive to the iPhone 15 Ultra, much like the Apple Watch Ultra.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Buttons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1365990/iphone-15-pro-solid-state-power-volume-buttons.html\">a rumor by Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, Apple might switch to solid-state buttons for the iPhone 15 Pro and Ultra models, much like the Home button on the iPhone SE. Kuo says Apple will add a pair of Taptic engines on either side of the phone to mimic the feel of a clickable button. A later set of<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1637837336158560256&amp;xcust=1-1-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"> reported CAD files revealed by ShrimpApplePro on Twitter</a> show how the Pro models will have a single unified volume button and the mute switch replaced by a mute button. According to these supposed CAD files, the non-Pro models will continue to have two volume buttons and a mute switch.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>USB-C</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The EU is mandating that most portable electronics, including phones, have to standardize around USB-C for charging ports (if any‚Äìgadgets that only charge wirelessly like the Apple Watch don‚Äôt need to <em>add</em> a USB-C port). Apple will have to transition several products over time, and instead of making special USB-C versions for Europe, will likely just change everything worldwide as we saw recently with the 10th-gen iPad and Siri remote. It‚Äôs expected that all iPhone 15 models will come with a USB-C port.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Current iPhones use USB-C power adapters, so that won‚Äôt change, just the USB-C to Lightning cable and the port on the iPhone itself. The upside? Potentially faster charging and faster data transfer speeds for those that plug their iPhones into their Macs or PCs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2023/02/22/exclusive-iphone-15-cads-reveal-larger-6-2-inch-display-dynamic-island-and-more/&amp;xcust=1-1-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">CAD files obtained by 9to5Mac</a> show a USB-C port on the iPhone 15.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dynamic Island</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One significant change to the display on the non-Pro iPhones is that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1069195/iphone-14-pro-dynamic-island-features-apps.html\">Dynamic Island</a>‚Äî that pill-shaped camera cutout that serves as an important interface element on iPhone 14 Pro‚Äì<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1070131/dynamic-island-iphone-15-models.html\">will come to <em>all</em> iPhone 15 models</a>. That means the non-Pro iPhones will have the same look and interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that this doesn‚Äôt mean that the iPhone 15 will get an always-on display or ProMotion, though. Those features are currently rumored to remain exclusive to the Pro models.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone-14-timer-island.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 14 Pro dynamic island timer\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone-14-timer-island.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone-14-timer-island.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone-14-timer-island.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone-14-timer-island.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone-14-timer-island.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone-14-timer-island.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone-14-timer-island.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /><figcaption><p>The Dynamic Island might come to all iPhone 15 models.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Jason Snell/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15 specs and features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple tests a lot of new technologies from a lot of suppliers, and over time little leaks can sometimes give us a clue as to what‚Äôs coming in the next iPhone. These leaks are sometimes wrong, often misunderstood, and generally miss software innovations that accompany the new hardware (such as Dynamic Island, where we only heard about the ‚Äúpill and hole‚Äù cutout and not how Apple intended to make use of it).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here‚Äôs what we currently expect to find inside the iPhone 15 line.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Periscope camera lens</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumors have said that Apple has been working on a ‚Äúperiscope lens‚Äù to offer a much longer-range optical zoom. It‚Äôs the same technology that allows the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra to achieve such a long zoom range. There hasn‚Äôt been a lot of movement on this rumor recently, but it was last suggested that this might be an exclusive feature of the iPhone 15 Pro Max. It‚Äôs unclear whether this would necessitate a different camera array layout or size, though the S22 Ultra‚Äôs cameras are much larger than the other models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, there are sure to be camera upgrades in the iPhone 15 as there are every year. Between a front camera and three rear cameras, you can bet at least one of them will get an improved sensor or lens. The only specific rumor around the cameras right now is that the iPhone 15 Pro Max may have a periscope telephoto camera, giving an optical zoom likely somewhere in the 5x to 10x range.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A17 processor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next major processor manufacturing technology bump out of TSMC (the company that makes most of Apple‚Äôs chips) wasn‚Äôt ready yet for the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1073243/a16-processor-cpu-gpu-lpddr5-memory-performance.html\">A16</a>. We think the A17 is likely to be one of the first mass-produced chips to use the chip manufacturer‚Äôs 3nm process, which should allow more transistors in the same area, allowing Apple to cram in more features and better performance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the iPhone 14 line, Apple reserved its new A16 for the Pro models and used the A15 again on the non-Pro models. We think that‚Äôs likely to continue in 2023, with the standard iPhone 15 using the A16 processor and the iPhone 15 Pro using the new A17.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Memory</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After the iPhone 14 Pro kept the same 6GB of memory as the iPhone 13 Pro, Trendforce reports that the iPhone 15 Pro/Ultra models will get 8GB of RAM. The non-Pro models are expected to have the same 6GB of RAM as this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple‚Äôs 5G modem</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has been working on its own cellular modem for <em>years</em> now, having acquired Intel‚Äôs modem unit in 2019 for $1B. While it was originally rumored that Apple could have a competitive 5G capable cellular modem <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/345908/apples-homegrown-5g-modem-reportedly-wont-be-arriving-anytime-soon.html\">ready in time</a> to be part of the iPhone 15, recent rumors suggest that won‚Äôt be the case. Back in May, Ming-Chi Kuo reported that the development of the modem had hit a ‚Äúroadblock,‚Äù and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1587922899268079616&amp;xcust=1-1-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Mark Gurman</a> reported in November that Qualcomm is expected to provide ‚Äúthe majority of new modems‚Äù for the iPhone 15. We should expect another Qualcomm Snapdragon modem instead, most likely the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/618603/apples-first-5g-modem-may-compete-with-qualcomms-snapdragon-x70.html\">Snapdragon X70</a>. </p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f568ad86208891dbaa86e7a9d810d09da05bebbb902ba8f9d5341b9e4b6d3ab7","category":"Apple"}
