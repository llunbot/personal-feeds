This corroborates <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/no-apple-event-for-new-ipads-macs-gurman/\">recent claim</a> that new Apple Pencils are on the way \"in the next several weeks.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is a limited amount of information about what an updated ‌‌Apple Pencil‌ might feature‌, but there have been rumors about <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-pencil-3-could-feature-magnetic-tips/\">magnetically interchangeable tips</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/17/apple-pencil-color-sensor-patent/\">color sampling capabilities</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/new-apple-pencil-allegedly-leaks/\">shorter design with a glossy finish</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's next-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models with OLED displays are widely rumored to launch this month, so it would make sense for a new ‌Apple Pencil‌ to arrive alongside them. The company is also expected to introduce a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/\">redesigned Magic Keyboard accessory</a>, so it seems that both of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>'s accessories may be refreshed simultaneously. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nInstant Digital has a mixed track record in terms of revealing accurate information about Apple's plans, but its claims are worth paying attention to. The source was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/\">first to report</a> the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a>'s Yellow spring refresh, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/future-iphone-could-capture-spatial-photos-videos/\">Spatial Video</a> capture on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/04/apple-watch-series-9-basically-unchanged/\">minor hardware update</a>, as well as being the only source of the only rumor claiming that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus would feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/iphone-15-and-15-plus-frosted-glass-rumor/\">frosted back glass</a>. However, they also made claims about <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/25/ios-17-lock-screen-apple-music-rumors/\">several iOS 17 features</a> and the release of a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/10/ipad-air-6-rumored-to-launch-in-october/\">new iPad Air in October 2023</a> that did not pan out.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/\">Instant Digital</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139\">iPad Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/new-apple-pencil-to-launch-this-month/\">New Apple Pencil Rumored to Launch This Month</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-pencil-rumored-to-launch-this-month.2421108/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fe7509d84930de9c164b705ee64bd833131dc7fb35c48f36bc19028cd443c91a","category":"Apple"}
