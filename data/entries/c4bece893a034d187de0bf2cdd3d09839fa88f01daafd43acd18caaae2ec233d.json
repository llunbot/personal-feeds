We've pulled out five features that we think are the most interesting and that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users will be most excited about when ‌iOS 17‌ launches this fall.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\n<ol>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>Live Voicemail</strong> - If you're like us, you sometimes forget that voicemail even exists. With ‌iOS 17‌, when someone calls and leaves a voicemail, you can see the transcription live on your Lock Screen. If they have something notable to say, you can pick up the call right then and there.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>StandBy</strong> - StandBy is similar to Nightstand mode for the Apple Watch. When you put your phone in landscape orientation on a charger, it activates a full-screen display with at-a-glance information like your calendar, clock, weather details, and even Live Activities. It's truly best with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/\">iPhone 14 Pro</a>'s always-on display, but it works on older iPhones if you tap on the screen.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>Interactive widgets</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Widgets</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a> and the Lock Screen are now interactive, which makes them much more useful. You can check off Reminders, control music playback, activate <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a> devices, and more, without having to open up an app.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>Keyboard updates</strong> - Autocorrect is using a new machine learning model that can better predict what you want to say. You can more quickly complete words just by tapping the space bar, and in some cases, fill entire sentences. When a word is corrected, it's now underlined, and you can tap it to revert back to the original word you typed if autocorrect makes a mistake.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>FaceTime on Apple TV</strong> - If you've ever wanted a larger display for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a>, you're in luck, because with ‌iOS 17‌ and tvOS 17, you can use ‌FaceTime‌ on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>. With Continuity Camera, you can connect your ‌iPhone‌ to your ‌Apple TV‌, using the ‌iPhone‌'s camera for ‌FaceTime‌ while the picture is displayed on the larger screen of the television set. All the usual ‌FaceTime‌ features work like Center Stage, and it's the perfect setup for calls with multiple people. ‌FaceTime‌ on ‌Apple TV‌ works with the new ‌FaceTime‌ effects that let you activate hearts, balloons, laser beams, and rain through gestures.</li>\r<br />\n</ol>\r<br />\nAn honorable mention should go to the Journal app that's coming in ‌iOS 17‌; it's just not on the list because it's not part of the initial ‌iOS 17‌ release. The Journal app will let you record your thoughts and activities each day, with Apple-provided prompts to help inspire you.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are a number of other features in ‌iOS 17‌ that are worth knowing about, including a fun option to customize what people see when you call them, a quicker way to share contact information with people, improvements to Messages, mood tracking, shared passwords, an option to lock the Safari private browsing window, AirTag sharing, and more. Full details <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">can be found in our iOS 17 roundup</a>, which is still undergoing updates.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDo you agree with our top picks?
