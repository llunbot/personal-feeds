After a brief foray into road riding in the mid-2000’s, I’ve been a dedicated ‘non-competitive cyclist’ for the last 15 years or so, and one way or another am on a bike most days. For the last 7+ years I’ve been commuting my kids to kinder and school on a Douze Messenger Cargo bike pushing 35kg (77lb) of bike, 57kg (125lb) of kids and 20kg (44lb) of bags around the inner north of Melbourne 5 days a week- luckily it’s pretty flat here, with mild weather most of the year.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1620\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_1003.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_1003.jpg?w=1620&amp;quality=75 1620w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_1003.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_1003.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_1003.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_1003.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_1003.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1620\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0997.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0997.jpg?w=1620&amp;quality=75 1620w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0997.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0997.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0997.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0997.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0997.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>With my 10yr old daughter now less keen on being seen at the school gate in a bike with her younger brother and dad, the daily commute is looking a bit different- with the kids often choosing to cycle themselves. Other than the cargo bike and my little used road bike, my only daily driver is a $100 steel-lugged early 80’s road bike (my pub bike), and although I love it dearly, it has very sketchy handling (courtesy of symmetrically bent front forks resulting from a late night return from the pub some years back), and an inability to stop when there is even a skerrick of moisture… so I was keen on sorting an all road drop bar bike which can follow the kids when they take off on dirt trails on their rigid MB-ish chunky tyred kids bikes, while also doing commuter duty and carrying a bag or two.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1620\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_1001.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_1001.jpg?w=1620&amp;quality=75 1620w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_1001.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_1001.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_1001.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_1001.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_1001.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I had many browser tabs open with potential gravel/ all road bikes and when my best friend from school George and his wife Erika stayed with us in January talk turned to bikes. George has lived in Bozeman for many years, and suggested I check out Adam’s bikes- they know Adam well, and Erika had just ordered a Super Something from the first batch of production frames. So I sent a few emails, and got a great feel from my correspondence with Adam and Jordan, and then all the articles on The Radavist etc. In the end, it seemed much better to be able to support a mate of a mate! Being a smaller guy (171cm), I was lucky that they still had the smaller frames from the first run in stock, and some measurements confirmed that the 52cm would fit the bill.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1620\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0995.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0995.jpg?w=1620&amp;quality=75 1620w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0995.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0995.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0995.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0995.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0995.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>George and Erika picked up the frame from Adam for me, and sent the box loaded with extras and gifts for my kids from Montana, which was really special. In the meantime, I decided that Commuter Cycles here in Melbourne would be the best shop to use for the build and advice- they are such an awesome bike shop, and specialise in commuting/ touring/ gravel and adventure bikes. The timing was good as they were having their annual garage sale, and so I snagged a partial Apex group set (no cranks/ brakes) for ridiculously cheap as well as some Cazadero tyres on special to get the ball rolling. Although I already had a few ideas based on Adam’s personal build (mechanical discs, White industry cranks etc), Sime from Commuter helped plan a great build with all of the parts and aesthetic decisions, as well as encouraging me to do things properly the first time around (custom wheels, dynamo lights etc).</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1620\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0998.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0998.jpg?w=1620&amp;quality=75 1620w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0998.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0998.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0998.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0998.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0998.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Reuben and Liam at Commuter built the bike up when it arrived, and did a great job keeping things neat and tidy (routing the dynamo cable through the rack tubing for example). Final touch will be some pint-sized pannier bags from Melbourne’s Framework designs which are in progress.</p>\n<p>The bike is an absolute dream- I’ve had it for just on 2 months, and get ridiculously excited every time I take it out. Had no idea a bike could feel this good- the way it eats up bumps, floats over cobbles and deals with varied terrain is addictive. It reminds me a bit of a classic Granturismo (GT) car from the 60’s- fast enough without being over the top sporty, looks beautiful, made with excellent components from around the world (US/Taiwan, UK, Germany, Japan, Australia) and brimming with plush accoutrements to facilitate every creature comfort (dynamo, fenders, luggage capacity).</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1620\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0996.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0996.jpg?w=1620&amp;quality=75 1620w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0996.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0996.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0996.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0996.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0996.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Thanks to all of the team from Commuter, especially Sime, Liam and Reuben- and credit to Will for these photos, which capture the feels/ vibe perfectly (with some bluestone cobbles to boot).
