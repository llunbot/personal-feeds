{"title":"Iowa Poll From ‘Best Pollster In Politics’: Kamala Harris Ahead 47-44","link":"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2024/11/02/iowa-poll-kamala-harris-leads-donald-trump-2024-presidential-race/75354033007/","date":1730684195000,"content":"\n<p>The Des Moine Register:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Kamala Harris now leads Donald Trump in Iowa — a startling\nreversal for Democrats and Republicans who have all but written\noff the state’s presidential contest as a certain Trump victory.</p>\n\n<p>A new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows Vice President\nHarris leading former President Trump 47% to 44% among likely\nvoters just days before a high-stakes election that appears\ndeadlocked in key battleground states. The results follow a\nSeptember Iowa Poll that showed Trump with a 4-point lead over\nHarris and a June Iowa Poll showing him with an 18-point lead over\nDemocratic President Joe Biden, who was the presumed Democratic\nnominee at the time.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s hard for anybody to say they saw this coming,” said pollster\nJ. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer &amp; Co. “She has clearly leaped\ninto a leading position.” [...]</p>\n\n<p>The poll shows that women — particularly those who are older or\nwho are politically independent — are driving the late shift\ntoward Harris.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No poll guarantees anything, of course, but this one stands out. If it holds up, Harris is on her way to a clear victory. It also explains Harris’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Funs6yyEw\">increasingly sunny demeanor</a> down the stretch and Trump’s increasingly erratic and desperate antics, like dressing up as a garbage man last week. Selzer is widely regarded as one of, if not <em>the</em>, <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/selzer/\">best pollster in America</a>. Her eve-of-election 2016 Iowa poll was an outlier, predicting Trump would beat Hillary Clinton by 7 points; Trump won Iowa by 9 points that year. In 2020, Selzer’s closing poll had Trump ahead of Biden by 7; he won the state by 8.</p>\n\n<p>The explanation for Harris’s surprise strength in Iowa — that women have had enough of Trump and his shithead revanchist misogynist party — holds water. If this poll is wrong, I still like Harris’s chances. If this poll is right, it’s in the bag for Harris.</p>\n\n<p>Iowa doesn’t get counted as a “swing state”, perhaps because Trump won it by such significant margins in 2016 and 2020, <a href=\"https://www.270towin.com/states/Iowa\">but in recent elections has swung back and forth by large margins</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2020: 🟥 Trump by 8.2</li>\n<li>2016: 🟥 Trump by 9.5</li>\n<li>2012: 🟦 Obama by 5.8</li>\n<li>2008: 🟦 Obama by 9.5</li>\n<li>2004: 🟥 W. by 0.7</li>\n<li>2000: 🟦 Gore by 0.3</li>\n<li>1996: 🟦 Clinton by 10.4</li>\n<li>1992: 🟦 Clinton by 6.0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And if you want to go back to what’s effectively now electoral pre-history, Mike Dukakis won Iowa by 10.2 points in 1988.</p>\n\n<p>Keep the faith. Be sure to vote.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/03/iowa-harris-ahead\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3ce681281488ffde370a7839f884cd5e286e2be7e21688e75e1237a364e31802","category":"Tech"}
