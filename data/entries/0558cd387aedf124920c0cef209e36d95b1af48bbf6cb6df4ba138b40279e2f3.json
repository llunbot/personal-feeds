The additional fee is likely to vary by region, with lower prices planned for \"developing markets,\" said the publication.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new tier is said to include AI-powered features allowing subscribers to mix songs from different artists. Spotify is also exploring various concert ticket sales strategies such as pre-sale access and premium seating options through discussions with major promoters and ticket vendors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new tier comes as Spotify looks to diversify its revenue streams and target devoted music fans who regularly spend money on merchandise, concerts, and fan clubs, according to the report. The company apparently believes the enhanced tier could attract millions of subscribers, despite the higher price point.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDevelopment of the additional tier has been in the works for several years, coming after recent price increases for existing subscriptions and the introduction of audiobook offerings. Spotify previously announced plans for a Hi-Fi tier in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/spotify-hifi-lossless-streaming-option/\">February 2021</a>, but a launch never materialized, even as rivals Apple Music and Amazon Music Unlimited began offering high-quality audio streaming within their standard subscriptions. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven the progress of its competitors, Spotify's paid-for \"Music Pro\" tier will need to be a more comprehensive offering that goes beyond just improved audio quality and some AI-produced playlists. What's actually offered remains to be seen.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/\">Spotify</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/17/spotify-hi-fi-premium-tier-coming-this-year/\">Spotify Readies Premium Tier With Hi-Fi Audio and AI Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-readies-premium-tier-with-hi-fi-audio-and-ai-features.2449567/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0558cd387aedf124920c0cef209e36d95b1af48bbf6cb6df4ba138b40279e2f3","category":"Apple"}
