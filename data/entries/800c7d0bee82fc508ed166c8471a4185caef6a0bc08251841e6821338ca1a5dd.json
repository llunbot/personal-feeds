A third individual, connected to both Porter \nand the original recipient of Porter’s health information, placed \nan $80,000 parlay bet to win $1.1 million, betting that Porter \nwould underperform against the Kings. </p>\n\n<p>To make sure that the bet hit, the league found, Porter pulled \nhimself out of that game against the Kings after just three \nminutes, claiming he was ill. The investigation also showed that \nfrom January through March, while either playing for Toronto or \nthe Raptors’ G League affiliate, Porter placed at least 13 bets on \nNBA games using an associate’s online betting account. While none \nof those bets were on games in which Porter played, he did bet on \nthe Raptors to lose as part of a parlay bet. The wagers ranged in \nsize from $15 to $22,000, and totaled $54,000. He netted nearly \n$22,000 in winnings on the wagers, the league said. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Porter is a bench player, but in the NBA bench players do well. <a href=\"https://hoopshype.com/player/jontay-porter/salary/\">Porter’s salary this season was $411,000</a>, and he’s earned close to $3 million since he made the NBA four years ago.
