As you’d expect, Campagnolo has used its highest-spec materials here, with a design that uses ‘technopolymer’ and carbon fibre. Like Shimano, Campagnolo’s road bike derailleurs don’t include a clutch (all of SRAM’s modern derailleurs do).</p>\n<p>Campagnolo says the derailleur should work with cassettes with up to a 32-tooth largest sprocket, so there is scope for lower gearing than the configurations available at launch.</p>\n<ul><li><b>Actual weight:</b> 256g (without battery)</li>\n<li><b>Actual weight: </b>296g (with battery)</li>\n</ul><h3>Campagnolo Super Record Wireless front derailleur weight</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless – real weights and specs – front derailleur\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless – real weights and specs – front derailleur\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Unlike SRAM’s matching AXS batteries, the Super Record Wireless front derailleur uses a different battery.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Felix Smith / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The front derailleur can handle a 16-tooth difference between chainring sizes – that’s larger than SRAM Red AXS, where chainring sizes differ by 13 teeth, but similar to Shimano Dura-Ace.</p>\n<p>The design of the front derailleur has been updated to accommodate a tyre up to 34mm wide without interference.</p>\n<p>To our eyes, the front derailleur looks quite chunky, particularly compared to the latest Dura-Ace housing, and this could have aerodynamic implications. The carbon fibre cage does look flashy though.</p>\n<ul><li><b>Actual weight: </b>125g (without battery)</li>\n<li><b>Actual weight: </b>159g (with battery)</li>\n</ul><h3>Campagnolo Super Record Wireless batteries weight</h3>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/08/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless--real-weights-and-specs-3-of-17-e52d59a.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless – real weights and specs – batteries\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless – real weights and specs – batteries\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The weight (and capacity) of the front battery is lower.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Felix Smith / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/08/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless--real-weights-and-specs-4-of-17-ed421ab.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless – real weights and specs – batteries\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless – real weights and specs – batteries\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The rear derailleur battery is slightly chunkier than the rear.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Felix Smith / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThe Super Record Wireless batteries are removable and they can either be charged on the derailleurs or taken off and charged elsewhere, via a magnetic charging port.\n<p>That’s different from SRAM, where the batteries have to be charged off the bike in a separate charging cradle, and Shimano, where the central battery is usually recharged on the bike, because it’s buried in the frame.</p>\n<p>Unlike SRAM, Campagnolo uses a different battery for each derailleur.</p>\n<ul><li><b>Front battery actual weight: </b>34g</li>\n<li><b>Rear battery actual weight: </b>39g</li>\n</ul><h3>Campagnolo Super Record Wireless shifters (pair) weight</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless – real weights and specs – shifters\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless – real weights and specs – shifters\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> We weighed the rear shifter at 263g and the front at 241g.

The bump that used to fall where you usually grip the lever has also been removed.</p>\n<p>As with SRAM and Shimano, if you don’t like how the shift buttons are configured, you can change this, using the My Campy 3.0 app.</p>\n<ul><li><b>Actual weight:</b> 241g (right), 263g (left)</li>\n</ul><h3>Campagnolo Super Record Wireless brake calipers weight</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless – real weights and specs – callipers\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless – real weights and specs – callipers\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The calipers are essentially unchanged versus the previous-generation groupset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Felix Smith / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The flat mount brake calipers have had some cosmetic changes, but use the same internals as the older Super Record EPS.</p>\n<p>They use a new (DB410) that Campagnolo says is 30 per cent lighter than its older pad, saving around 12g. The bolts for the calipers weigh 20g in total, front and rear.</p>\n<ul><li><b>Actual weight:</b> 130g</li>\n</ul><h3>Campagnolo Super Record Wireless brake rotors weight</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless – real weights and specs – rotors\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless – real weights and specs – rotors\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 140mm rotors weigh 99g a piece and the 160mm rotors 121g.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The rotors are another part that’s carried over from the older groupset – we have the 140mm and 160mm pieces.</p>\n<p>A small amount of play is built into the carriers of the floating rotors. Campagnolo says this enables the brake to better absorb heat because it enables the braking surface to expand more easily.</p>\n<ul><li><b>Actual weight:</b> 99g (140mm), 121g (160mm)</li>\n</ul><h3>Campagnolo Super Record Wireless cassette (10-29t) weight</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless – real weights and specs – cassette\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless – real weights and specs – cassette\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 12-speed cassette is available in three options.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The machined steel cassette is available in three sizes: 10-25t, 10-27t and 10-29t.</p>\n<p>The five largest sprockets come as a single cluster and the rest are individual sprockets, in contrast to the Red cassette, which is machined in one piece and the Dura-Ace, which includes five titanium larger sprockets in the 11-30t and six in the 11-34t cassettes.</p>\n<ul><li><b>Actual weight:</b> 229g (10-29t, with lockring)</li>\n</ul><h3>Campagnolo Super Record Wireless crankset weight</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless – real weights and specs – crankset\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless – real weights and specs – crankset\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The right-hand crank and chainrings weigh 436g.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Felix Smith / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Super Record Wireless crankset has a four-arm one-piece carbon spider and crank arms.

Another feature we reckon is coming is a power meter – there’s a nice, covered recess in the back of the cranks that looks purpose-built to add one, although Campagnolo is saying nothing.</p>\n<p>The bolt circle diameter is 121/88mm and there is a 45.8mm chainline. The cranks are available in 165, 170, 172.5 and 175mm lengths, with a Q-Factor of 147.5mm, a 3mm increase from the older crankset to accommodate the ever-widening tyres on modern bikes.</p>\n<p>We have 172.5mm cranks with 48/32t rings, which weigh 630g in total.</p>\n<ul><li><b>Actual weight:</b> 436g (right side), 194g (left side), 630g (total)</li>\n</ul><h3>Campagnolo Super Record Wireless chain weight</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless – real weights and specs – chain\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless – real weights and specs – chain\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s a 12-speed chain and (uncut) it weighs 225g.
