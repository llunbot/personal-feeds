Milan Vader (Jumbo-Visma) won Stage 4 and currently leads the ongoing Tour of Guangxi with one day remaining. It’s been an entertaining affair so far, with victories for Elia Viviani (Ineos Grenadiers), Jonathan Milan (Bahrain Victorious), Olav Kooij (Jumbo-Visma) and most recently Sebastián Molano (UAE Team Emirates) on Stage 5.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><p><em>Results powered by <a href=\"https://firstcycling.com/race.php?r=7591&amp;y=2023&amp;s=5\" target=\"_blank\">FirstCycling.com</a></em></p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile at the Tour of Türkiye, Alexey Lutsenko (Astana) topped the general classification as Chiara Consonni (UAE Team ADQ) won the overall at the Tour of Chongming Island. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/filippo-ganna-hour-record\">Filippo Ganna breaks Hour Record and Chris Boardman’s Best Human Effort</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-hour-record\">What is the cycling Hour Record?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/in-praise-of-the-hour-record\">In praise of the Hour Record</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Vittoria Bussi surpasses 50km, reclaims Hour record</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Vittoria-Bussi-hour-record-970x728.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Vittoria-Bussi-hour-record-970x728.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Vittoria-Bussi-hour-record-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Vittoria-Bussi-hour-record-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Vittoria-Bussi-hour-record-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Vittoria-Bussi-hour-record-750x563.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Vittoria-Bussi-hour-record-1140x855.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Vittoria-Bussi-hour-record.jpeg 2000w\" /><figcaption>UCI Media</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The cycling <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-hour-record\" target=\"_blank\">Hour record</a> – the greatest distance covered in one hour on a bicycle – has been reclaimed by Vittoria Bussi at the Velodrome Bicentenario in Mexico. As part of her ‘Road2Record’ campaign which described the project as a ‘challenge and redemption’, the Italian became the first woman to surpass 50km in her ride, hitting a distance of 50.267km. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bussi, who has a PhD in mathematics and whose GoFundMe raised €12,000 for the attempt, previously held the Hour record in 2018 with a distance of 48.007km. This was beaten by <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/joss-lowden-breaks-hour-record\" target=\"_blank\">Joss Lowden (48.405km)</a> three years later, who was in turn bested by <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/ellen-van-dijk-absolutely-smashes-women-s-hour-record\" target=\"_blank\">Ellen van Dijk (49.254km)</a> last May.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After setting the new mark, Bussi said, ‘I owe this to all those who supported me throughout the year, believing in me and my project. This achievement is the result of outstanding teamwork, and I want to thank everyone who contributed to making it happen.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Josh Tarling goes wrong way, beats Remco Evenepoel </h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>Not even sure where to start, unbelievable day.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Joshytarling?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@joshytarling</a> wins Chrono des Nations in front of the world champion and Fin takes 2nd in the junior version.

The Ineos Grenadiers rider, who recently became European Champion in the elite men’s ITT, was fastest over the 45.4km route in France, beating Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) by 13 seconds. Tarling’s victory comes just 12 months after he won the Junior Chrono des Nations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the women’s race, Austian national time-trial champion Anna Kiesenhofer beat fellow countrywoman Christina Schweinberger (Fenix-Deceuninck) by a single second over 27.2km.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Madis Mihkels, Gerben Thijssen pulled from Tour of Guangxi</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>Updated statement on Madis Mihkels and Gerben Thijssen. <a href=\"https://t.co/MhNnkfIBbl\" target=\"_blank\">https://t.co/MhNnkfIBbl</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/End82rGbtD\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/End82rGbtD</a></p>— Intermarché-Circus-Wanty (@IntermarcheCW) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IntermarcheCW/status/1712052759707435377?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">October 11, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Just before the six-day Gree-Tour of Guangxi, Madis Mihkels and Gerben Thijssen of Intermarché-Circus-Wanty were pulled from the race. Mihkels had pulled back his eyes to make a ‘slanted eye’ gesture while laughing, and Thijssen then posted it to his Instagram story. Intermarché-Circus-Wanty initially released a statement to condemn Mihkels and withdraw him from the race. An hour later, they added Thijssen’s name in an updated release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The statement reads: ‘We sincerely regret the behaviour of our riders Madis Mihkels and Gerben Thijssen and the images shown on social media. We would like to apologise to the Chinese people and fans, to the government of Guangxi, to the Chinese Cycling Association, and all parties involved in the organisation of the Tour of Guangxi for the image given of our sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Our team Intermarché-Circus-Wanty… and our partners always defend equal opportunities and fight daily against racism. We withdraw Mihkels and Thijssen from the race and [will] take the necessary disciplinary steps to close this incident.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See you next week.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vittoria-bussi-uci-hour-record\">Pro Log: Vittoria Bussi reclaims UCI Hour record, Josh Tarling beats Remco Evenepoel at Chrono des Nations, Madis Mihkels and Gerben Thijssen pulled from Tour of Guangxi for racist gesture</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"dcb0def748f8642b9c26a40b90eab232fe0f2cc735facb96724e09d029e7c445","category":"Cycling"}
