Pivot explains it’s basically a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/pivot-switchblade-29-pro-review/\">Pivot Switchblade</a> with a motor.</p>\n<p>The Shuttle AM is the brand’s first bike to use a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/bosch/\">Bosch motor</a>, with the top-spec bike, built in limited numbers only, benefitting from the race-ready Performance CX Race <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electric-bike-motors/\">electric bike motor</a>.</p>\n<p>The carbon-framed bike sticks with Dave Weagle’s DW-link suspension, as seen across all of the Arizona brand’s full-suspension bikes.</p>\n<h2>Pivot Shuttle AM construction details</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pivot Shuttle AM\" title=\"Pivot shuttle am bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The latest Pivot in the line-up is a versatile all-mountain riding eMTB.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pivot</i></span></div>\n<p>Carbon is used throughout the bike, with front and rear triangles being built from the fibre and resin-based material.</p>\n<p>Two co-rotating links (when the suspension compresses, both links rotate clockwise if you’re looking at the bike from the driveside) join the two halves of the bike, as per Dave Weagle’s instructions.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">DW-link suspension</a> is ideal for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-mountain-bikes/\">electric mountain bikes</a>, according to Pivot, because the suspension doesn’t squat (compress) so much under power. With additional watts being squirted through to the back end thanks to the motor, this is ideal.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"DW Link suspension linkage\" title=\"Pivot shuttle am dw link\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The DW-link suspension is said to be ideal on an ebike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pivot</i></span></div>\n<p>By reducing the interaction of pedal power and suspension squat, Pivot is then able to run lighter <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-set-up-your-mountain-bike-suspension-video-guides-to-help-you-get-the-most-from-your-bike/\">compression tunes</a> on the shock, designed to improve feel.</p>\n<p>The linkage also remains active under braking, has impressive square-bump absorption properties and contributes to a stiff rear half of the bike, because there are no pivots in the rear triangle to engineer around.</p>\n<p>Add in plenty of mid-stroke support, and Pivot says the bike “swallows any terrain with total confidence and control, with enough platform to feel lively and pedal efficiently, and enough progression to crush rock gardens and nimbly land the biggest drops”. That’s quite the claim.</p>\n<p>Pivot has used 157mm-wide Super Boost spacing for the rear.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/07/Pivot-shuttle-am-tool-1058859.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Pivot and Topeak tool stowage\" title=\"Pivot shuttle am tool\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>A selection of Topeak multi-tools have been given a bracket under the top tube, if you want to carry them on board.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Pivot</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/07/Pivot-shuttle-am-controller-061696a.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Wireless Bosch controller\" title=\"Pivot shuttle am controller\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>This diminutive controller is what’ll toggle the motor through its modes.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Pivot</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/07/Pivot-shuttle-am-display-125aebc.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Bosch motor display unit\" title=\"Pivot shuttle am display\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The top-tube mounted display shows five colour-changing bars to indicate battery level in 10 per cent increments.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Pivot</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Architectural considerations</h3>\n<p>Pivot has built the Shuttle AM with a vertically mounted shock. This leaves more room inside the main triangle for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-water-bottles/\">water bottles</a>, or range-extending batteries.</p>\n<p>It also means the top tube and down tube are free from having to deal with the forces generated through a shock mount. This means they can be lighter and makes it easier for Pivot to engineer in their desired ride characteristics.</p>\n<p>The shock bolts into the already stout motor mounting area, instead.</p>\n<p>The ride-quality issue also comes into play when you need to remove the battery.</p>\n<p>Pivot hasn’t built an access door into the down tube for taking out the battery. Doing so, it says, means the whole front triangle becomes too stiff, and adds weight. Instead, if you want to remove the battery, you’ll have to take off the motor first.</p>\n<h2>Motoring on</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bosch Performance CX Race motor\" title=\"Pivot shuttle am motor\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A run of 500 bikes will come fitted with Bosch’s premium motor.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pivot</i></span></div>\n<p>Speaking of motors, Pivot has travelled to Germany for the drive unit on this model, rather than the Japanese <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-ep600-ep801/\">Shimano EP8</a> motors plugged into its other bikes.</p>\n<p>The latest-generation Bosch Performance CX motors have been used here.</p>\n<p>The Pro and Team models get the standard motor, while the Race version sports the premium Race motor. This pumps out up to 400 per cent of your input, and provides up to 85Nm of torque.</p>\n<p>The Race motor is said to be the lightest Bosch has ever made, and the power curves have been tweaked to suit racing requirements.</p>\n<p>Pivot tells us Bosch needs to pre-approve bikes that are intended to feature this motor, to ensure it’s locked into the most appropriate bikes. It will only supply brands with 500 units, ensuring this is a sought-after bike.</p>\n<p>As such, 300 of the Race model bikes will go to the US market, 100 to Europe and 100 to the rest of the world.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bosch battery extender\" title=\"Pivot shuttle am battery extender\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> An additional 250Wh of battery capacity will be available via this bolt-on pack available later this year.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pivot</i></span></div>\n<p>Power modes are pre-loaded, but with the Bosch x Pivot Flow app, these can be modified to suit your needs. It’ll also give you a head’s up on maintenance schedules, help find local dealers and give you plenty of battery and ride data to boot.</p>\n<p>Across the models, a top-tube mounted display shows the mode and remaining battery level (in 10 per cent coloured bar increments), and features an on/off button. There’s then a simple wireless mode controller on the bars, ensuring a clean appearance.</p>\n<p>The entry-level Pro model gets a 625Wh battery, while the Team and Race bikes have 750Wh batteries.</p>\n<p>Later this year, we’re expecting to see a range-extending ‘PowerMore’ battery, offering an additional 250Wh. This will be mountable to the bottle mounts in the frame, meaning a full 1,000Wh of power could be carried.</p>\n<h2>Pivot Shuttle AM geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Geometry flip chip\" title=\"Pivot shuttle am linkage geo\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Half a degree and 5mm isn’t much, but people want their geometry flip chips…</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pivot</i></span></div>\n<p>Pivot hasn’t been extravagant with the bike’s shape, with angles and measurements all falling well within the usual moderately aggressive trail (or, ‘all-mountain’ if you want to call it as such) MTB bell curve.</p>\n<p>There is a geometry flip chip, though. Going from the Low (listed below) to the High setting steepens angles by half a degree and adds 5mm to the bottom-bracket height.</p>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>﻿</th><th>SM</th><th>MD</th><th>LG</th><th>XL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Seat tube length </b> (mm)</td><td>378</td><td>39.9</td><td>43.2</td><td>47</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Top tube length</b> (mm)</td><td>599</td><td>63.1</td><td>64.9</td><td>67.1</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Head tube length</b> (mm)</td><td>110</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>14</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Head tube angle </b>(degrees)</td><td>64.1</td><td>64.1</td><td>64.1</td><td>64.1</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Seat tube angle </b>(degrees) </td><td>76.4</td><td>76.4</td><td>76.4</td><td>76.4</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Chainstay length </b>(mm)</td><td>444</td><td>444</td><td>444</td><td>444</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Bottom bracket height</b> (mm)</td><td>345</td><td>345</td><td>345</td><td>345</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Bottom bracket drop</b> (mm)</td><td>29</td><td>29</td><td>29</td><td>29</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Standover height</b> (mm)</td><td>715</td><td>715</td><td>715</td><td>715</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Wheelbase </b>(mm)</td><td>1,217</td><td>1,251</td><td>1,270</td><td>1,295</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Stack</b> (mm)</td><td>632</td><td>642</td><td>651</td><td>660</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Reach</b> (mm)</td><td>431</td><td>461</td><td>476</td><td>496</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<h2>Pivot Shuttle AM model details</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pivot Shuttle AM outside\" title=\"Pivot shuttle am outside\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Rocks and roots are the Shuttle AM’s playground.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pivot</i></span></div>\n<p>Three models of the Shuttle AM will be offered by Pivot – the Pro, Team and Race.</p>\n<p>The Pro receives a smaller-capacity battery, which contributes to the lower price, while the Race gets the limited-edition Race motor from Bosch.</p>\n<p>Fox has been used for the suspension, will all bikes getting a 160mm 36 fork and a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/rear-shocks/fox-float-x-factory-review/\">Float X shock</a>.
