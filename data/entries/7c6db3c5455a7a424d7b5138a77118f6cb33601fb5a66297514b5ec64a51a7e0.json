Pu said Foxconn will ramp up AirPods assembly at a factory in India in the fourth quarter of 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman previously said Apple plans to release <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/17/airpods-4-production-and-launch-timing/\">two fourth-generation AirPods models in September or October</a>, including entry-level and mid-tier models. He said both models will feature a new design with better fit, improved sound quality, and an updated charging case with a USB-C port, while the mid-tier model will also feature active noise cancellation and a speaker for Find My location tracking. It is unclear if the lower-priced AirPods and the entry-level fourth-generation AirPods are the same product, but it seems plausible.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPu also expects updated AirPods Max to be released in the fourth quarter of 2024. Gurman previously said a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/new-airpods-later-this-year-rumor/\">USB-C charging port will be the only new feature</a> for the over-ear headphones, and new color options are also a possibility.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 3</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/01/lower-cost-airpods-late-2024-rumor/\">Lower-Cost AirPods Rumored to Launch Later This Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lower-cost-airpods-rumored-to-launch-later-this-year.2423331/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7c6db3c5455a7a424d7b5138a77118f6cb33601fb5a66297514b5ec64a51a7e0","category":"Apple"}
