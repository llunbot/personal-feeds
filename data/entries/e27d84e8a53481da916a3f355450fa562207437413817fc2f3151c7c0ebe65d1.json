Customers on the <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/europe-macbook-pros-14-and-16-inch-pre-orders-orders-and-delivery-status.2316663/page-16\">MacRumors Forum</a> are also reporting that UPS is sending emails to customers informing them of unknown mechanical failures and that estimated delivery dates will vary depending on the conditions on the ground.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe mechanical failures, possibly about aircraft, are causing shipments of MacBook Pros, and presumably, other consumer electronic devices, to be left stationary on the ground in cities in China. Some shipments are still on-the-ground in Shanghai and Seoul, South Korea, and publicly available flight records show few UPS flights scheduled to depart either city today, at the time of writing. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCologne, Germany, serves as one of UPS' main hubs in Europe and is where MacBook Pro shipments are likely to arrive from Asia before being sent to customers across Europe. One UPS flight from Seoul to Cologne that was scheduled for later today has been canceled, as <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/qb0g2y/comment/hi7zi6t/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">noted on Reddit</a>.
