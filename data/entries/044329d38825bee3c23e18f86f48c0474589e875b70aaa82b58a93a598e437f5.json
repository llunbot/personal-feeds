{"title":"iPhone Rumored to Get 200MP Camera Like Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/iphone-200-megapixel-camera-rumor/","date":1748364520000,"content":"Apple is testing a 200-megapixel camera sensor, according to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/\">Digital Chat Station</a>, a user with a large following on Chinese social media platform Weibo. The account has previously shared accurate information about Apple's future products.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Cameras.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nWhile the <a href=\"https://weibo.com/6048569942/PtJ4ZzwhL\">account's post today</a> does not provide any further details, this 200-megapixel camera sensor would likely be for the main rear camera on a future high-end iPhone model. Samsung introduced a 200-megapixel rear camera <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/01/samsung-galaxy-s23-lineup/\">on its Galaxy S23 Ultra in 2023</a>, and the follow-up S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra models also have one.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith a 200-megapixel camera, an iPhone would be able to shoot photos with greater detail. The increased megapixel count would also result in higher-resolution photos, which can be cropped further and printed at larger sizes without a loss of image quality.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models are rumored to feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto/\">entirely 48-megapixel cameras</a>, so the 200-megapixel camera is unlikely to be available this year. In addition, a 200-megapixel camera has yet to be rumored for the iPhone 18 Pro models. Ultimately, the upgraded camera specification could be at least a few years away.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/\">Digital Chat Station</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/iphone-200-megapixel-camera-rumor/\">iPhone Rumored to Get 200MP Camera Like Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-rumored-to-get-200mp-camera-like-samsungs-galaxy-s25-ultra.2457771/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"044329d38825bee3c23e18f86f48c0474589e875b70aaa82b58a93a598e437f5","category":"Apple"}
