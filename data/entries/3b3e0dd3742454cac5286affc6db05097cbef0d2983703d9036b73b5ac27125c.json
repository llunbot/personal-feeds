Now, it is available for an even lower $649 heading into the back-to-school shopping season. It is unclear how long the deal will last.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple first released the MacBook Air with the M1 chip in November 2020, as one of the first Macs with an Apple silicon chip instead of an Intel processor. The configuration being sold for $649 includes the M1 chip, 256GB of storage, and 8GB of RAM/unified memory, with Gold, Silver, and Space Gray color options available. Walmart's product listing says the MacBook Air is in brand new condition, so this is not a used/refurbished model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-discontinues-m1-macbook-air/\">discontinued the MacBook Air with the M1 chip</a> earlier this year, following the launch of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/\">new MacBook Air models with the M3 chip</a>. Prior to being discontinued, the model with the M1 chip was being sold for a starting price of $999 brand new.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile this model of the MacBook Air is now over three and a half years old, it is still a very capable machine for many average day-to-day tasks. However, it has an older design and has fewer remaining years of macOS compatibility than the latest MacBook Air models, so those aspects should be factored into your purchasing decision.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Walmart, and we may receive a small payment if you click a link in this article and proceed to make a purchase.</small><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/walmart/\">Walmart</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/walmart-m1-macbook-air-for-649/\">Walmart Selling MacBook Air With M1 Chip for $649 Starting Today</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/walmart-selling-macbook-air-with-m1-chip-for-649-starting-today.2430907/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3b3e0dd3742454cac5286affc6db05097cbef0d2983703d9036b73b5ac27125c","category":"Apple"}
