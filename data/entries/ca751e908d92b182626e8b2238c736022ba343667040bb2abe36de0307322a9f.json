Until last May, they were being detained in Argentina while a court mulled the Department of Justice's extradition request, and the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/us-seizes-z-library-login-domain-but-secret-urls-for-each-user-remain-active/\">US quickly moved to seize Z-Library domains</a>.</p>\n<p>But according to a translated article from a local publication called <a href=\"https://www.lavoz.com.ar/sucesos/los-rusos-buscados-por-el-fbi-se-escaparon-de-la-prision-domiciliaria-en-cordoba/\">La Voz</a>, the pair suddenly disappeared after submitting a request \"to be considered political refugees\" in order to \"avoid being sent to the US.\" Napolsky and Ermakova had long denied wrongdoing, and apparently they \"ran away\" after giving up on the legal process. They reportedly even stopped talking to their defense lawyer.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035869#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035869&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ca751e908d92b182626e8b2238c736022ba343667040bb2abe36de0307322a9f","category":"Tech"}
