In the depths of the device, among the MS-DOS productivity apps built into its fixed memory, there lurked a first-person maze game called <em>Lair of Squid</em>. Intrigued by the game, we tracked down its author, Andy Gryc, and probed into the title's mysterious undersea origins.</p>\n\n<p>\"If you ask my family, they’ll confirm that I’ve been obsessed with squid for a long time,\" Gryc told Ars Technica. \"It’s admittedly very goofy—and that’s my fault—although I was inspired by <i>Doom</i>, which had come out relatively recently.\"</p>\n<p>In <i>Lair of Squid</i>, you're trapped in an underwater labyrinth, seeking a way out while avoiding squid roaming the corridors. A collision with any cephalopod results in death. To progress through each stage and ascend to the surface, you locate the exit and provide a hidden, scrambled code word. The password is initially displayed as asterisks, with letters revealed as you encounter them within the maze.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022814#p3\">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022814&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8fcaa9b59cb39c75c042b33e4a482676132b6781593d1f3ee2b8e76cebb0bd62","category":"Tech"}
