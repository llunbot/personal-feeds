When live game broadcasts were finished, the memory cartridges used to store game data would report themselves as empty, even though they technically were not. Keeping that same 1MB memory cartridge in the system when another broadcast started would overwrite that data, and there were no rebroadcasts.</p>\n<div><div></div><p>Recordings from some of the <em>F-Zero</em> Soundlink broadcasts on the Satellaview add-on for the Super Famicom (Super Nintendo in the US). </p></div>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.pressthebuttons.com/2024/02/lost-satellaview-f-zero-tracks-return.html\">reported by Matthew Green at Press the Buttons</a> (along with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDcrM706gws\">Did You Know Gaming's informative video</a>), data from some untouched memory cartridges was found and used to re-create some of the content. Some courses, part of a multi-week \"Grand Prix 2\" event, have never been found, despite a $5,000 bounty offering and extensive effort. And yet, remarkably, the 10 courses in those later broadcasts were reverse-engineered, using a VHS recording, machine learning tools, and some manual pixel-by-pixel re-creation. The results are \"north of 99.9% accurate,\" according to those who crafted it and exist now as <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/bs_f-zero_deluxe_v1.0\">a mod you can patch onto an existing <em>F-ZeroÂ </em>ROM</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002898#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002898&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a86ea54f62b6835f263d8e19b7ee4ec1f2bd16f6d9e7e3cbfe61fa596a2f691c","category":"Tech"}
