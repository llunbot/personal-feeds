Naturally, Google is doing that by ramping up Gemini integration. The company has announced new automation capabilities with generative AI, as well as better support for third-party devices via the Home API. Google AI will also plug into a new Android widget that can keep you updated on what the smart parts of your home are up to.</p>\n<p>The Google Home app is where you interact with all of Google's smart home gadgets, like cameras, thermostats, and smoke detectorsâ€”some of which have been discontinued, but <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/google-discontinues-nest-protect-smoke-alarm-and-nest-x-yale-lock/\">that's another story</a>.
