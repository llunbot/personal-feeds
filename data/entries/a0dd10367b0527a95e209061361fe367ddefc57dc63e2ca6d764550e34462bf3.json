Danni became British gravel national champ in 2022, then in 2023 raced to a storming fourth place on her debut at <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/unbound-gravel\" target=\"_blank\">Unbound Gravel</a>, arguably the world’s hardest gravel race – 200 unsupported miles (320km) across the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/little-ride-on-the-prairie-dirty-kanza-sportive-review\" target=\"_blank\">Kansas prairies</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Danni tells us why this was one of the most chaotic races of her life, from shacking up with strangers (the hotels were full) to having her race all but ended by freak storms. And she didn’t even pack a paint stick (what and why’s that? stay tuned). This weekend, 1st June, Danni will race Unbound Gravel 2024, and here she gives us a behind the scenes look at just how it all works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interview begins at 9.08</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Follow Danni on Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/danni_shrosbree/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@Danni_Shrosbree</a> and on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig6qCPaTB2Y\" target=\"_blank\">her YouTube channel</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Unbound Gravel takes place on the weekend of 1st June from 10.50pm BST. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>For live coverage of the women’s Unbound Gravel 2024 follow <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/unboundgravel/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@UnboundGravel</a>; for live coverage of the men’s follow <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lifetimegrandprix/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@LifeTimeGrandPrix</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/cyclist-magazine-podcast/episodes/106-unbound-gravel-2024-racing-with-british-champ-danni-shro\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 106 now on Acast</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\">all episodes</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know <em>Cyclist</em> is also stunning monthly magazine?
