{"title":"New – Visualize Your VPC Resources from Amazon VPC Creation Experience","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-visualize-your-vpc-resources-from-amazon-vpc-creation-experience/","date":1675716062000,"content":"<p>Today we are announcing <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/vpc\">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a> (Amazon VPC) resource map, a new feature that simplifies the VPC creation experience in the AWS Management Console. This feature displays your existing VPC resources and their routing visually on a single page, allowing you to quickly understand the architectural layout of the VPC.</p> \n<p>A year ago, in March 2022, we launched a new VPC creation experience that streamlines the process of creating and connecting VPC resources. With just one click, even across multiple Availability Zones (AZs), you can create and connect VPC resources, eliminating more than 90 percent of the manual steps required in the past. The new creation experience is centered around an interactive diagram that displays a preview of the VPC architecture and updates as options are selected, providing a visual representation of the resources and their relationships within the VPC that you are about to create.</p> \n<p>However, after the creation of the VPC, the diagram that was available during the creation experience that many of our customers loved was no longer available. Today we are changing that! With VPC resource map, you can quickly understand the architectural layout of the VPC, including the number of subnets, which subnets are associated with the public route table, and which route tables have routes to the NAT Gateway.</p> \n<p>You can also get to the specific resource details by clicking on the resource. This eliminates the need for you to map out resource relationships mentally and hold the information in your head while working with your VPC, making the process much more efficient and less prone to mistakes.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Getting Started with VPC Resource Map</u></strong><br /> To get started, choose an existing VPC in the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc\">VPC console</a>. In the details section, select the <strong>Resource map</strong> tab. Here, you can see the resources in your VPC and the relationships between those resources.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/02/02/2023-vpc-resource-map-1.jpg\" alt width=\"2179\" height=\"1377\" /></p> \n<p>As you hover over a resource, you can see the related resources and the connected lines highlighted. If you click to select the resource, you can see a few lines of details and a link to see the details of the selected resource.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Getting Started with VPC Creation Experience</u></strong><br /> I want to explain how to use the VPC creation experience to improve your workflow to create a new VPC to make a high-availability three-tier VPC easily.</p> \n<p>Choose <strong>Create VPC</strong> and select <strong>VPC and more</strong> in the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc\">VPC console</a>. You can preview the VPC resources that you are about to create all on the same page.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/02/02/2023-vpc-resource-map-2.jpg\" alt width=\"2845\" height=\"1320\" /></p> \n<p>In <strong>Name tag auto-generation</strong>, you can specify a prefix value for Name tags. This value is used to generate Name tags for all VPC resources in the preview. If I change the default value, which is <code>project</code> to <code>channy</code>, the Name tag in the preview changes to <code>channy-</code> something, such as <code>channy-vpc</code>. You can customize a Name tag per resource in the preview by clicking each resource and making changes.</p> \n<p>You can easily change the default CIDR value (<code>10.0.0.0/16</code>) when you click the IPv4 CIDR block field to reveal the CIDR joystick. Use the left or right arrow to move to the previous (<code>9.255.0.0/16</code>) or next (<code>10.0.1.0/16</code>) CIDR block within the <code>/16</code> network mask. You can also change the subnet mask to <code>/17</code> by using the down arrow, or go back to <code>/16</code> using the up arrow.</p> \n<p>Choose the number of Availability Zones (AZs) up to 3. The number of public and private subnet types changes based on the number of AZs and shows the total number of each subnet type it will create.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/02/02/2023-vpc-resource-map-3.jpg\" alt width=\"2756\" height=\"1077\" /></p> \n<p>I want a high-availability VPC in three AZs and select <strong>6</strong> for the number of private subnets. In the preview panel, you can see that there are 9 subnets. When I hover over <code>channy-rtb-public</code>, I can visually confirm that this route table is connected to three public subnets and also routed to the internet gateway (<code>channy-igw</code>). The dotted lines indicate routes to network node, and the solid lines indicate relationships such as implicit or explicit associations.</p> \n<p>Adding NAT gateways and VPC endpoints is easy. You can simply change the number of NAT gateways in or per Availability Zone (AZ). Note that there is a charge for each NAT gateway. We always recommend having one NAT gateway per AZ and route traffic from subnets in an AZ to the NAT gateway in the same AZ for high availability and to avoid inter-AZ data charges.</p> \n<p>To route traffic to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3\">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> (Amazon S3) buckets more securely, you can choose the <strong>S3 Gateway</strong> endpoint by default. The S3 Gateway endpoint is free of charge and does not use NAT gateways when moving data from private subnets.</p> \n<p>You can create additional tags and assign them to all resources in the VPC in no time. I select <strong>Add new tag</strong> and enter environment for the <strong>Key</strong> and test for the <strong>Value</strong>. This key-value pair will be added to every resource here.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/02/02/2023-vpc-resource-map-4.jpg\" alt width=\"995\" height=\"768\" /></p> \n<p>Choose <strong>Create VPC</strong> at the bottom of the page and see the resources and the IDs of those resources that are being created. Before creating, please validate resources from the preview.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/02/02/2023-vpc-resource-map-5.jpg\" alt width=\"1593\" height=\"924\" /></p> \n<p>Once all the resources are created, choose <strong>View VPC</strong> at the bottom. The button takes you directly to the VPC resource map, where you can see a visual representation of what you created.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/02/02/2023-vpc-resource-map-6.jpg\" alt width=\"2464\" height=\"1383\" /></p> \n<p><strong><u>Now Available</u></strong><br /> Amazon VPC resource map is now available in all AWS Regions where Amazon VPC is available, and you can start using it today.</p> \n<p>The VPC resource map and creation experience now only displays VPC, subnets, route tables, internet gateway, NAT gateways, and Amazon S3 gateway. The Amazon VPC console teams and user experience teams will continue to improve the console experience using customer feedback.</p> \n<p>To learn more, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/working-with-vpcs.html#view-vpc-resource-map\">Amazon VPC User Guide</a>, and please send feedback to <a href=\"https://repost.aws/tags/TATGuEiYydTVCPMhSnXFN6gA/amazon-vpc\">AWS re:Post for Amazon VPC</a> or through your usual AWS support contacts.</p> \n<p>– <a href=\"https://twitter.com/channyun\">Channy</a></p>","author":"Channy Yun","siteTitle":"AWS News Blog","siteHash":"117ec22616e844cb857d03ca62c57a411a8affc77cb5e8b6b15bf6","entryHash":"e149d949d7559be21ab14ee22d1b21e51881f7b9e529c69719130e","category":"Tech"}
