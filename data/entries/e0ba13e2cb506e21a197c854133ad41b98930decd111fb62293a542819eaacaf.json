Pu revealed this information in a research note about the tech industry released today.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iPhone-15-Blue-Three-Quarters-Perspective-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nMore details about these potential features are outlined below.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Wi-Fi 7</h2>\r<br />\nWi-Fi 7 devices will be able to send and receive data over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. With technologies such as 4K QAM, Wi-Fi 7 is expected to offer peak data transfer speeds of over 40 Gbps, a 4× increase over Wi-Fi 6E.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is still rolling out Wi-Fi 6E support to its devices. The key advantage of Wi-Fi 6E is support for the 6GHz band for increased bandwidth, whereas regular Wi-Fi 6 is limited to the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. Apple has so far added Wi-Fi 6E to the iPad Pro, 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro, Mac Studio, Mac Pro, and Mac mini, and the upcoming iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/20/iphone-15-pro-wifi-6e/\">also expected to support the standard</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe progression would be as follows:<ul><li><strong>iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max:</strong> Wi-Fi 6</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max:</strong> Wi-Fi 6E</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max:</strong> Wi-Fi 7</li></ul><h2>48MP Ultra Wide Camera</h2>\r<br />\nAn upgrade to a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide lens on the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max should allow the lens to capture more light, resulting in improved photos when shooting in 0.5× mode, especially in low-light environments.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone 14 Pro models already have a 48-megapixel Main lens that uses \"pixel binning\" to merge data from four pixels on the camera's image sensor into one \"super pixel\" for improved low-light capture. With the iPhone 16 Pro models, this technology is expected to expand to the Ultra Wide lens, which is currently a 12-megapixel lens.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis also means that iPhone 16 Pro models should be able to shoot <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-14-pro-take-48-megapixel-proraw-photos/\">48-megapixel ProRAW photos</a> in Ultra Wide mode. These photos retain more detail in the image file for more editing flexibility, and can be printed at large sizes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Timing</h2>\r<br />\nApple is expected to unveil the iPhone 16 lineup in September 2024, so the devices are still over a year away from launching. Early rumors should always be treated with more skepticism, as Apple's plans could change over time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's also worth nothing that Wi-Fi 7 might not be finalized until late 2024, so there is a chance that the standard will not be ready in time for the iPhone 16 Pro.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wi-fi-7/\">Wi-Fi 7</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/\">iPhone 16 Pro Said to Feature Wi-Fi 7 Support, 48MP Ultra Wide Camera</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-said-to-feature-wi-fi-7-support-48mp-ultra-wide-camera.2398710/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e0ba13e2cb506e21a197c854133ad41b98930decd111fb62293a542819eaacaf","category":"Apple"}
