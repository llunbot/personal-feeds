There’s video of the 9-hour workshop, but it’s locked behind a password (<em>insert joke about the EC’s support for openness here</em>). I can’t imagine sitting through that, even at 2× speed. Lucky for us, Kay Jebelli followed along live and took copious notes in a thread on Twitter/X:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Interesting detail: the EC told Apple that they aren’t allowed to \nnotarize apps to protect users. So “government authorities are the \nones that are going to have to step up to protect” app developers \nand users from the risks of these 3rd-party apps. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, the EC has a problem Apple doing <em>any vetting whatsoever</em> on app distributed outside the App Store. The EC will take care of making sure malware, phishing, scams, clones, IP rip-offs, and pirated apps aren’t getting through.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/18/apple-dma-compliance-workshop\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"61925108b75f45b664491958bb29e43f1ebd85f56aad16405d1ac82ad9db199d","category":"Tech"}
