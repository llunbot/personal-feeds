Hundreds of everyday cyclists make their way up a mountain road, and then Sergio Higuita (EF Education–Nippo) and Daniel Martinez (Ineos Grenadiers) streak past them as if they’re standing still. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The difference between WorldTour and the rest of us cyclists,” reads the caption. The video is a frankly jawdropping comparison we don’t normally get to see, set to the rousing tones of AC/DC’s ‘Back in Black’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, have a look:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>A diferença dos WORLDTOUR para os demais ciclistas.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HiguitSergio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@HiguitSergio</a> e <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danifmartinez96?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@danifmartinez96</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ADtDXSgQZf\">pic.twitter.com/ADtDXSgQZf</a></p>— País do Ciclismo (@DoCiclismo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DoCiclismo/status/1457477573882138630?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 7, 2021</a></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps predictably, it’s all gone low-key Twitter viral. Most people have simply marvelled at the physical spectacle. But for Sergio Higuita, there was a bigger implication: all that attention has resulted in his contract with EF Education-Nippo being terminated early. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Higuita, whose contract with EF is up at the end of the year, wasn’t riding his team-issue Cannondale SuperSix Evo (or his Rapha bib knicks, for that matter). Instead, he was riding the bike he’ll be racing next year: an S-Works Tarmac SL7 in Bora-Hansgrohe livery. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Normally that wouldn’t be a big deal – as an EF Education spokesperson told Cyclingnews, “We recognize Sergio needs time to adjust to his new equipment, as he’s heading to a new team next season. Riders routinely request permission before using new equipment at team camps and in non-public settings, which the team routinely grants.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the public nature of Higuita’s ride – which was at the Giro de Rigo event, organised by EF teammate Rigoberto Uran – meant that the team felt slighted, saying that Higuita’s decision “lacked respect for the partners that support [Higuita] today. As a result, the team has sent a notice of termination regarding his contract. We ultimately hope to work with Sergio to come to an amicable solution.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CORVOS_00033276-124-1340x734.jpg\" /><figcaption>Sergio Higuita makes his way through some extremely atmospheric fans at the 2021 Tour de France – an event which saw him finish in the top 10 on five stages. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s likely an expensive lesson for Higuita, but even with this setback, it’s fair to say the Colombian’s star is on the rise. The 24-year-old is a Grand Tour stage winner and a podium finisher at both Paris-Nice and the Tour of Colombia. In his signing announcement at Bora-Hansgrohe, team manager Ralph Denk noted his prospects for hilly one-day races and stage wins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until January 1, however, Higuita will be a privateer, riding extremely fast up mountains, rocking whatever bike and knicks he wants. </p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/11/sergio-higuita-has-been-fired-for-riding-the-wrong-bike/\">Read More</a>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"bd19847f6aa8cdeaeec80a3ed359595457024a25e0de87524db6a5037f4ac9c6","category":"Cycling"}
