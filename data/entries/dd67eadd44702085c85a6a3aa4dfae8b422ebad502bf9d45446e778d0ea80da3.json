However, Apple also offers a wide range of lesser-known products that, while not necessarily as popular or powerful, remain important parts of its ecosystem. Based on the rumor calendar, 2025 is set to be a packed year for Apple hardware, and these six forgotten devices could finally be getting some long-overdue upgrades.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone SE 4</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being the least capable 2025 Apple phone, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">iPhone SE 4</a>—or <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2566753/why-apples-bizarre-iphone-se-name-change-actually-makes-sense.html\">iPhone 16E</a>—could turn out to be a best-seller after it likely launches in March. Compared to its three-year-old predecessor, the fourth-generation budget iPhone is expected to feature an all-new exterior that resembles an iPhone 14 or 15. That’s not to mention supporting Apple Intelligence (thanks to the base A18 chip), adopting Face ID, switching to USB-C, boasting an edge-to-edge OLED panel, and packing a 48MP rear camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>September’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17</a> phones will undoubtedly intrigue more users with their high-end technical specifications. Nevertheless, given its rumored sub-$500 price, the iPhone SE 4 could convince budget-conscious customers to finally upgrade their worn-out iPhones or mid-range Android phones. After all, it will likely be the first SE model to offer both a modern design and premium internals—and that’ll entice numerous undecided buyers to opt for it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Watch SE 3</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another outdated SE product rumored to get an upgrade this year is the Apple Watch. Despite being the company’s cheapest smartwatch, this model provides a reliable experience—sans some inessential perks currently exclusive to the Series and Ultra models. So, for just $249, users get the same battery life and main set of watchOS apps, excluding support for ECG, an always-on display, and precision finding. This makes it the perfect pick for those seeking to live a more active life but can’t justify paying extra for the bonus sensors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September, the Apple Watch SE 3 is expected to launch with a fresh design, retiring the aluminum chassis in favor of colorful plastic. Consequently, the wearable could potentially drop its price to better compete against cheap fitness trackers and appeal to youngsters. Beyond that, it could pack a faster S-series chipset, bringing faster performance and unlocking more demanding features.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Watch Series 9\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The Apple Watch SE hasn’t changed much in 5 years.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>AirTag 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Released in 2021, the AirTag is arguably the most effective Bluetooth tracker for casual item location. It’s powered by Apple’s vast Find My network, making it discoverable by hundreds of millions of iDevices around the planet. At some point this year, Apple is expected to finally release the coin-sized tracker’s successor, featuring a newer ultra-wideband chip and added privacy measures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the upgraded UWB chip, users will reportedly be able to locate the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2523902/a-new-airtag-is-coming-next-year-with-enhanced-privacy-security-features.html\">AirTag 2</a> with more precision. And since many criminals rely on modified AirTags to stalk their victims, Apple could make removing its speaker more challenging. It certainly won’t be 2025’s most exciting launch, but given the nature of the product, it’s a welcome upgrade nonetheless.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>HomePod mini 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The HomePod mini turns five this year. And, disregarding the superficial color refresh, it has yet to receive its first upgrade. Fortunately, the 2nd-gen model could finally launch in the fall. Based on credible rumors, the HomePod mini 2 will boast a faster processor, Apple’s in-house wireless connectivity chipset, potential Wi-Fi 6E support, and an enhanced UWB chip for improved Handoff. The speaker could also play a bigger role in Apple’s HomeKit infrastructure, as the company is about to embrace and take smart home products more seriously. It may not be the most groundbreaking release, but it certainly will maximize the HomePod mini’s function in people’s houses.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple TV 4K 4</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of homes, the Apple TV 4K could get its first upgrade in three years this fall, too. The fourth-generation model, like the HomePod mini 2, will likely adopt Apple’s own networking chip, along with a faster A-series brain. Besides potentially expanding its smart home capabilities, it’s unclear if the Apple TV 4K 4 will bring any other notable features, but expect it to be positioned as a new smart home device that’s more than just a silent home hub.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple-TV-4K-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple TV 4K 3\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple-TV-4K-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple-TV-4K-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple-TV-4K-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple-TV-4K-3.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple-TV-4K-3.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple-TV-4K-3.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple-TV-4K-3.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple-TV-4K-3.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The next-gen Apple TV 4K might be more than just a set-top box.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Studio and Pro displays</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Launched in 2019 and 2022, respectively, the Pro Display XDR and Studio Display are overdue for an upgrade. Despite starting at $4,999 and packing industry-leading technology, the former screen could use some improvements. For example, its current refresh rate caps out at 60Hz, so supporting ProMotion (120Hz) would be a great start. It could also borrow some Studio Display features, such as the FaceTime camera and spatial audio speakers. This would turn it into a higher-end variant of the Studio Display—and far more enticing for its $4,999 price tag—and maybe include a stand this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, this year’s Studio Display could finally switch to mini-LED and improve the bundled webcam. It remains to be seen if Apple has other upgrades in store or plans to drop its $1,599 starting price.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>In with the new</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering Apple doesn’t upgrade the devices above as frequently as other products, this year will be the perfect entry point for newcomers. Customers looking to get started with the essentials will be able to own an affordable, up-to-date iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirTag. Meanwhile, users migrating their media streaming setup to Apple will appreciate the equally inexpensive Apple TV 4K and HomePod mini—which can seamlessly output tvOS audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while the first-party displays may be relatively niche, their release could accompany new, M4-powered Mac Studio and Mac Pro machines. These would pair well together for professionals seeking high-end configurations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, beyond these six forgotten products, Apple also has a slew of regular updates on tap. These will likely include an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2575467/the-m4-macbook-air-is-set-to-kick-off-a-loaded-2025-for-the-mac.html\">M4 MacBook Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2576353/apple-intelligence-brings-a-huge-spec-bump-for-the-basic-ipad.html\">iPad Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2158175/ipad-11th-gen-2025-release-date.html\">iPad 11</a> with Apple Intelligence support, M5 MacBook Pro and iPad Pro, Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3, and hopefully <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2575929/apples-fall-launches-are-shaping-up-to-be-smarter-than-usual.html\">some surprises</a> along the way.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"dd67eadd44702085c85a6a3aa4dfae8b422ebad502bf9d45446e778d0ea80da3","category":"Apple"}
