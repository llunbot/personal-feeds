The laptop is expected to be unveiled alongside iOS 17, macOS 14, watchOS 10, tvOS 17, and Apple's long-awaited AR/VR headset.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/MacBook-Air-Multiple-Sizes-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nGurman revealed the plans <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on\">in his newsletter</a> on Sunday:<blockquote>As part of watchOS 10, the company is planning to bring back widgets and make them a central part of the interface. This new strategy will debut at WWDC in June, alongside the unveiling of iOS 17, macOS 14, the 15-inch MacBook Air, and, of course, the much-anticipated mixed-reality headset.</blockquote>The well-connected Apple reporter previously said new MacBooks were coming at WWDC, but this is the first time he explicitly confirmed the 15-inch MacBook Air will be unveiled at the conference, which will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/29/apple-announces-wwdc-2023/\">begin with Apple's keynote on June 5</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n15-inch MacBook Air rumors began in early 2021, and production of display panels for the laptop reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/10/15-inch-macbook-air-component-production/\">ramped up in recent months</a> as its launch nears. Like the 13-inch MacBook Air, the initial 15-inch model will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/20/kuo-15-inch-macbook-air-two-m2-chip-options/\">powered by the standard M2 chip</a> with multiple GPU configurations, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo design changes have been rumored for the 15-inch MacBook Air beyond its larger display size. The 13-inch model has a notch in the display, a 1080p camera, a MagSafe 3 charging port, two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a scissor switch Magic Keyboard with a Touch ID button, and a Force Touch trackpad, with available color options including Midnight, Starlight, Space Gray, and Silver.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple announced the 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip at WWDC last year.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2023</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/01/gurman-15-inch-macbook-air-wwdc/\">Gurman: Apple to Announce 15-Inch MacBook Air at WWDC</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-apple-to-announce-15-inch-macbook-air-at-wwdc.2388326/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d41aaa93d9118bf453403e582983814ab1d46ac3bc38a1ece6ad716f9eee638d","category":"Apple"}
