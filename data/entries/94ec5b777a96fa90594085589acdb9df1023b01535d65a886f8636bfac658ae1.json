You can always <strong>ask a question live</strong>, you can share your screen and get immediate feedback, and you can work on group exercises with people around the world. In fact, that‚Äôs why we‚Äôve <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/how-we-run-smashing-online-workshops/\">fallen in love with online workshops</a> ‚Äî and have a full program scheduled for the months to come.</p>\n<p>For many of us, personal workspace can feel quite comfortable and convenient, but nobody really wants to sign up for another full day of focused screen time. That‚Äôs why we break  workshops down into <strong>2.5h-sessions</strong>, with one session per day. So you always have enough time take it all in, try things out, <strong>rewatch a session</strong> or raise questions between sessions. That‚Äôs not something most in-person workshops can provide. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/616485526\">Here's what our workshops are like</a>.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/\"><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c4eb5950-0133-403c-9d85-7e7f8e01edb3/online-workshops-20021-22.png\" /></a>\nMeet <a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/\">Smashing Online Workshops</a>: live, interactive sessions on frontend &amp; UX.\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/how-we-run-smashing-online-workshops/\">Live discussions and interactive exercises</a> are at the very heart of every workshop, with group work, homework, reviews and live interaction with people around the world.
