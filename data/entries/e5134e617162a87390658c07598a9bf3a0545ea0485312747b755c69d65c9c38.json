Apple recently fell out of\nthe talks to join the round, which is slated to close next week,\naccording to a knowledgeable person.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/26/murati-openai\">just observed the other day</a> that the tumultuous (to say the least) leadership situation at OpenAI seems incongruous with Apple’s.</p>\n\n<p>Also surely related, to some degree, is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/openai-chatgpt-investors-funding.html\">this report on OpenAI’s financials</a> that dropped yesterday from Mike Isaac and Erin Griffith at The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>OpenAI’s monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, up 1,700\npercent since the beginning of 2023, and the company expects about\n$3.7 billion in annual sales this year, according to financial\ndocuments reviewed by The New York Times. OpenAI estimates that\nits revenue will balloon to $11.6 billion next year.</p>\n\n<p>But it expects to lose roughly $5 billion this year after paying\nfor costs related to running its services and other expenses like\nemployee salaries and office rent, according to an analysis by a\nfinancial professional who has also reviewed the documents. Those\nnumbers do not include paying out equity-based compensation to\nemployees, among several large expenses not fully explained in the\ndocuments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://hachyderm.io/@robpike/113212958758344294\">Rob Pike, on Mastodon</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>OpenAI: We lose a little on every sale but we make it up in volume.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/28/wsj-openai-apple\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e5134e617162a87390658c07598a9bf3a0545ea0485312747b755c69d65c9c38","category":"Tech"}
