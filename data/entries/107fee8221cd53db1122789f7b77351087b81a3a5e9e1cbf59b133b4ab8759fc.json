Designers challenge established ways of working. They ask a lot of questions — much needed ones but also uncomfortable ones. They focus “too much” on user needs, pushing revenue projections back, often with long-winded commitment to testing and research and planning and scoping.</p>\n\n<p>Almost every department in almost every company has their own clearly defined objectives, <strong>metrics and KPIs</strong>. In fact, most departments — from finance to marketing to HR to sales — are remarkably good at visualizing their impact and making it visible throughout the entire organization.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/ux-metrics-video-course-release/design-KPI-tree.png\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/ux-metrics-video-course-release/design-KPI-tree.png\" /></a>Designing a KPI tree, an example of how to connect business objectives with design initiatives through the lens of design KPIs. (<a href=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/ux-metrics-video-course-release/design-KPI-tree.png\">Large preview</a>)\n\n<p>But as designers, we rarely have a set of <strong>established Design KPIs</strong> that we regularly report to senior management. We don’t have a clear definition of design success. And we rarely measure the impact of our work once it’s launched. So it’s not surprising that moste parts of the business barely know what we actually do all day long.</p>\n\n<p>Business wants results. It also wants to do more of what has worked in the past. But it doesn’t want to <em>be disrupted</em> — it wants to <em>disrupt</em>. It wants to reduce <em>time to market</em> and minimize expenses; increase revenue and existing business, find new markets. This requires fast delivery and good execution.</p>\n\n<p>And that’s what we are often supposed to be — good “executors”. Or to put differently, “pixel pushers”.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/ux-metrics-video-course-release/usability-scoring.png\" /></p>\n<p>Over years, I’ve been searching for a way to change that. This brought me to <strong>Design KPIs and UX scorecards</strong>, and a workflow to translate business goals into actionable and measurable design initiatives. I had to find a way to explain, visualize and track that incredible impact that designers have on all parts of business — from revenue to loyalty to support to delivery.</p>\n\n<p>The results of that journey are now public in our new video course: <a href=\"https://measure-ux.com\">“How To Measure UX and Design Impact”</a> — a <strong>practical guide for designers</strong>, researchers and UX leads to measure and visualize UX impact on business.</p>\n\nAbout The Course\n\n<p>The course dives deep into <strong>establishing team-specific design KPIs</strong>, how to track them effectively, how to set up ownership and integrate metrics in design process. You’ll discover how to translate ambiguous objectives into <strong>practical design goals</strong>, and how to measure <strong>design systems</strong> and UX research.</p>\n<p>Also, we’ll make sense of OKRs, Top Task Analysis, SUS, UMUX-Lite, UEQ, TPI, KPI trees, feedback scoring, gap analysis, and Kano model — and what UX research methods to choose to get better results. <a href=\"#video-course-chapters\">Jump to the table of contents</a> or <a href=\"https://measure-ux.com/\">get your early-bird</a>.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/ux-metrics-video-course-release/measure-ux-new-course-vitaly-friedman.jpg%20\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/ux-metrics-video-course-release/measure-ux-new-course-vitaly-friedman.jpg%20\" /></a>The setup for the video recordings.

Yet NPS has many limitations, requires a large sample size to be statistically reliable, and what people say and what people do are often very different things. Let’s see <strong>what we as designers can do with NPS</strong>, and how it relates to our UX work.<br /><br /><strong>Keywords:</strong><br />Business metrics, MAU, MRR, ARR, CLV, ACV, Net Promoter Score, customer loyalty.</p>\n             </div>\n         <br />         \n              <div>\n                <div>\n                  6.

With top tasks analysis, we focus on what matters, and explore <strong>task success rates</strong> and <strong>time on task</strong>. We need to identify representative tasks and bring 15–18 users in for testing. Let’s dive into how it all works and some of the important gotchas and takeaways to consider.<br /><br /><strong>Keywords:</strong><br />Top task analysis, UX metrics, task success rate, time on task, qualitative testing, 80% success, statistical reliability, baseline testing.</p>\n             </div>\n         \n         \n              <div>\n                <div>\n                  11.

We need to be careful on how we shape our questions to avoid biases, how to find the right segment of audience and large enough sample size, how to provide high confidence levels and low margins of errors. In this chapter, we review <strong>best practices</strong> and a <strong>cheat sheet</strong> for better survey design — along with do’s and don’ts on question types, rating scales, and survey pre-testing.<br /><br /><strong>Keywords:</strong><br />Survey design, question types, rating scales, survey length, pre-testing, response rates, statistical significance, sample quality, mean vs. median scores.</p>\n             </div>\n         \n         \n              <div>\n                <div>\n                  12.

But what if you don’t have access to any users? Perhaps because of NDA, IP concerns, lack of clearance, poor availability, and high costs of customers and just lack of users? Let’s explore how we can <strong>find a way around such restrictive environments</strong>, how to engage with stakeholders, and how we can measure efficiency, failures — and set up UX KPI programs.<br /><br /><strong>Keywords:</strong><br />B2B, enterprise UX, limited access to users, compliance, legacy systems, compliance, desk research, stakeholder engagement, testing proxies, employee’s UX.</p>\n             </div>\n         \n         \n              <div>\n                <div>\n                  13.

To do that, we can build up and present Design KPI trees. From the bottom up, the tree captures <strong>user needs, pain points, and insights</strong> from research, which inform design initiatives. For each, we define UX metrics to track the impact of these initiatives, and they roll up to higher-level design and business KPIs. Let’s explore how it all works in action and how you can use it in your work.<br /><br /><strong>Keywords:</strong><br />User needs, UX metrics, KPI trees, sub-trees, design initiatives, setting up metrics, measuring and reporting design impact, design workflow, UX metrics graphs, UX planes.</p>\n             </div>\n         \n         \n              <div>\n                <div>\n                  14.

Well, we don’t start with metrics. We start by identifying most critical user needs and assess the impact of meeting user needs well. To do that, we apply event storming by <strong>mapping critical user’s success moments</strong> as they interact with a digital product. Our job, then, is to maximize success, remove frustrations, and pave a clear path towards a successful outcome — with event storming.<br /><br /><strong>Keywords:</strong><br />UX mapping, customer journey maps, service blueprints, event storming, stakeholder alignment, collaborative mapping, UX lanes, critical events, user needs vs. business goals.</p>\n             </div>\n         \n         \n              <div>\n                <div>\n                  15.

To <strong>test how effective our design ideas are</strong>, we can map them against a Kano model und run a concept testing survey. It gives us a user’s sentiment that we then need to weigh against business priorities. Let’s see how to do just that.<br /><br /><strong>Keywords:</strong><br />Feature prioritization, threshold attributes, performance attributes, excitement attributes, user’s sentiment, mapping design ideas, boosting user’s satisfaction.</p>\n             </div>\n         \n         \n              <div>\n                <div>\n                  16.

We start by running a collaborative event storming to identify key success moments. Then we prioritize key events and explore how we can amplify and streamline them. Then we ideate and come up with design initiatives. These initiatives are stress tested in an impact-effort matrix for viability and impact. Eventually, we define and assign metrics and KPIs, and pull them together in a KPI tree. Here’s how it works from start till the end.<br /><br /><strong>Keywords:</strong><br />Uncovering user needs, impact-effort matrix, concept testing, event storming, stakeholder collaboration, traversing the KPI tree.</p>\n             </div>\n         \n         \n              <div>\n                <div>\n                  17.

We need to find a balance between the two. It depends on what we want to measure, what we actually can measure, and whether we want to track local impact for a specific change or global impact for the entire customer journey. Let’s figure out <strong>how to define and establish metrics</strong> that actually will help us track our UX success.<br /><br /><strong>Keywords:</strong><br />Local vs. global KPIs, time spans, percentage vs. absolute values, A/B testing, mapping between metrics and KPIs, task breakdown, UX lanes, naming design KPIs.</p>\n             </div>\n         \n         \n              <div>\n                <div>\n                  18. Design KPIs Examples\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                  +\n              </div>\n          \n          \n              <div>\n                <p>Different contexts will require different design KPIs. In this chapter, we explore a <strong>diverse set of UX metrics</strong> related to search quality (quality of search for top 100 search queries), form design (error frequency, accuracy), e-commerce (time to final price), subscription-based services (time to tier boundaries), customer support (service desk inquiries) and many others. This should give you a good starting point to build upon for your own product and user needs.<br /><br /><strong>Keywords:</strong><br />Time to first success, search results quality, form error recovery, password recovery rate, accessibility coverage, time to tier boundaries, service desk inquiries, fake email frequency, early drop-off rate, carbon emissions per page view, presets and templates usage, default settings adoption, design system health.</p>\n             </div>\n         \n         \n              <div>\n                <div>\n                  19.

You need to discuss and <strong>decide what you want to measure and how often</strong> it should happen. But also how to integrate metrics, evaluate data, and report findings. And how to embed them into an existing design workflow. For that, you will need time — and green lights from your stakeholders and managers. To achieve that, we need to tap into the uncharted waters of UX strategy. Let’s see what it involves for us and how to make progress there.<br /><br /><strong>Keywords:</strong><br />Stakeholder engagement, UX maturity, governance, risk mitigation, integration, ownership, accountability, viability.</p>\n             </div>\n         \n         \n              <div>\n                <div>\n                  20.

How exactly would you do that? In this chapter, we explore the process of selecting representative tasks, recruiting participants, facilitating testing sessions, and analyzing the resulting data to create a compelling report and presentation that will <strong>highlight the value of your UX efforts</strong> to stakeholders.<br /><br /><strong>Keywords:</strong><br />Data analysis, reporting, facilitation, observation notes, video clips, guidelines and recommendations, definition of design success, targets, alignment, and stakeholder’s buy-in.</p>\n             </div>\n         \n         \n              <div>\n                <div>\n                  21.

Basically, it’s four states, mapped against touch points in a customer journey: baseline (threshold not to cross), current state (how we are currently doing), target state (objective we are aiming for), and industry benchmark (to stay competitive). Let’s see how it would work in an actual project.<br /><br /><strong>Keywords:</strong><br />Competitive benchmarking, baseline measurement, local and global design KPIs, cross-teams metrics, setting realistic goals.</p>\n             </div>\n         \n         \n              <div>\n                <div>\n                  22.

Surely it’s not just a roll-out speed for newly designed UI components or flows. Most teams track productivity and coverage, but we can also go beyond that by measuring <strong>relative adoption</strong>, <strong>efficiency gains</strong> (time saved, faster time-to-market, <strong>satisfaction score</strong>, and product quality). But the best metric is how early designers involve the design system in a conversation during their design work.<br /><br /><strong>Keywords:</strong><br />Component coverage, decision trees, adoption, efficiency, time to market, user satisfaction, usage analytics, design system ROI, relative adoption.</p>\n             </div>\n         \n         \n              <div>\n                <div>\n                  23.

To track the impact of UX research, we need to <strong>track outcomes and research-specific metrics</strong>. The way to do that is to track UX research impact for UX and business, through organisational learning and engagement, through make-up of research efforts and their reach. And most importantly: amplifying research where we expect the most significant impact. Let’s see what it involves.<br /><br /><strong>Keywords:</strong><br />Outcome metrics, organizational influence, research-specific metrics, research references, study observers, research formalization, tracking research-initiated product changes.</p>\n             </div>\n         \n         \n              <div>\n                <div>\n                  24.

Now, how do you get your UX metrics initiative off the ground? By following small steps heading in the right direction. Small commitments, pilot projects, and design guilds will support and enable your efforts. We just need to define realistic goals and turn UX metrics in a <strong>culture of measurement</strong>, or simply a way of working. Let’s see how we can do just that.<br /><br /><strong>Keywords:</strong><br />Pilot projects, UX integration, resource assessment, evidence-driven design, establishing a baseline, culture of measurement.</p>\n             </div>\n         \n         \n              <div>\n                <div>\n                  25.
