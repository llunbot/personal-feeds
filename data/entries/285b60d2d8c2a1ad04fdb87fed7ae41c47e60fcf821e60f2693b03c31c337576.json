{"title":"Future iPad Pro and MacBook Pro Models Rumored to Feature Ultra-Bright Double-Stack OLED Displays","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/03/future-ipad-pro-macbook-pro-oled-displays/","date":1635948803000,"content":"Apple is in discussions with Samsung and LG over applying OLED displays with a two-stack tandem structure to future iPad and MacBook models, but the devices are likely several years away from launch, according to <a href=\"http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=3536\">Korean website <em>The Elec</em></a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/Oled-iPads-and-MackBook-Pro-Notch.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe report indicates that a two-stack tandem structure would consist of two layers of red, green, and blue emission layers, allowing for the future iPad and MacBook models to have significantly brighter displays with up to double the luminance. Apple's current OLED devices like the iPhone have a single-stack structure, the report adds.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGiven that OLED technology is expensive, it's likely the displays will be used on future iPad Pro and MacBook Pro models specifically. The report claims the future iPads will come in 11-inch and 12.9-inch sizes, which are indeed the current iPad Pro sizes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe report claims the two-stack iPad displays will also be low-power LTPO panels, which could allow for a wider ProMotion refresh rate range between 10Hz and 120Hz, in line with the iPhone 13 Pro models. iPad Pro models have already supported ProMotion since 2017, but with a refresh rate between 24Hz and 120Hz.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTiming remains a big question mark. While some earlier reports claimed the first iPad with an OLED display <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/02/kuo-apple-cancels-ipad-air-plans-2022/\">was slated for release in 2022</a>, today's report claims the timeframe has been pushed back to late 2023 or 2024. The first MacBook with an OLED display might follow in 2025, but this plan could be postponed further, the report adds.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the meantime, Apple has adopted mini-LED backlighting, starting with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro and the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models. Mini-LED technology offers increased brightness for HDR content and improved contrast ratio.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Update:</strong> A separate report <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Electronics/Apple-pushes-display-tech-in-new-direction-with-latest-MacBook-Pro\">from <em>Nikkei Asia</em></a> today claims that Apple is also actively researching and developing micro-LED display technology.<blockquote>In the long term, industry insiders expect the rise of even smaller micro-LEDs that measure under 100 microns and can express primary colors without the use of a filter.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has made an acquisition in micro-LEDs and is said to have an active development program in this field.</blockquote><div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">14 &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/\">OLED</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/03/future-ipad-pro-macbook-pro-oled-displays/\">Future iPad Pro and MacBook Pro Models Rumored to Feature Ultra-Bright Double-Stack OLED Displays</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/future-ipad-pro-and-macbook-pro-models-rumored-to-feature-ultra-bright-double-stack-oled-displays.2321570/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mO8amf_-pP8:xCMvzGbyUzM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mO8amf_-pP8:xCMvzGbyUzM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/mO8amf_-pP8\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"285b60d2d8c2a1ad04fdb87fed7ae41c47e60fcf821e60f2693b03c31c337576","category":"Apple"}
