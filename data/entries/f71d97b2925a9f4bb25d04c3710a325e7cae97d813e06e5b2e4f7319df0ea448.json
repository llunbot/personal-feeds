The Xring O1 chip will be included in three devices to begin with, including the Xiaomi Tablet 7 Ultra–a newly announced 14-inch tablet. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nLike the latest-generation Apple silicon chips, the Xring O1 is made with a ‌3nm‌ fabrication process. The company explicitly said that it asked itself:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<blockquote>We also want to become one of the top chipmakers, with our phones targeting iPhones, can our chips also be compared against those of Apple's?</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Xring O1 will lag behind Apple's latest chips in some respects, such as processor clock speed, but the company still stressed its design achievement. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt a special event to announce the chip and tablet in Beijing, Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun said that the company plans to invest 200 billion yuan ($27.8 billion) in research and development over the next five years. At least $7 billion will be invested in developing and enhancing its own chip technology over the next decade.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/xiaomi/\">Xiaomi</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/xiaomi-announces-custom-chip/\">Xiaomi Announces Custom Chip to Rival Apple Silicon</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/xiaomi-announces-custom-chip-to-rival-apple-silicon.2457503/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f71d97b2925a9f4bb25d04c3710a325e7cae97d813e06e5b2e4f7319df0ea448","category":"Apple"}
