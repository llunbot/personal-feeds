This built sample is a size large, but just in Titanium as a custom build. Custom Ti yoke is in-house, designed to my specs, and printed by SILCA in the US. Paragon fittings throughout. The internal dropper fits up to 200mm thanks to external water bottle studs. Updated DT cable routing. Built weight, as pictured, is in the 25lb range, so it’s not a light weight but definitely a grounded, low-slung classic New England hardtail with an eye to straightforward forward, aggressive simplicity.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Full-Suspension-01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Full-Suspension-01.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Full-Suspension-01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Full-Suspension-01.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Full-Suspension-09.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Full-Suspension-09.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Full-Suspension-09.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Full-Suspension-09.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Full-Suspension-07.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Full-Suspension-07.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Full-Suspension-07.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Full-Suspension-07.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Snakedriver Steel Full Suspension Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>65° HT</li>\n<li>76° ST</li>\n<li>25mm bb drop</li>\n<li>440mm CS length</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Snakedriver is built around a 140mm fork and delivers 120mm of rear travel thanks to a flex pivot of my own design. 3D printed 15-5 stainless steel yoke, main pivot, and seat stay clevis. Sizes small through XL will fit a large water bottle. Under top tube accessory mount. Over DT external cable routing. Internal dropper routing. Room for 2.5-2.6” tires.

The Snakedriver is meant for long days in the saddle or short after-work jib-fest. Basically, I wanted a bike that’s not too big, punches above its weight, is easily maintainable thanks to common hardware throughout and is just fast and fun. Everything you need and not anything more.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Frame-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Frame-02.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Frame-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Frame-02.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The raw frame is actually a custom one off 27.5” version for Lynn but it’s identical in size to a stock large Snakedriver but has been revised for 27.5” wheels. All of the stock frames will be 29” FYI. I’m thinking the stock steel versions will be in the 5k range with an announcement for small batch in-house made in NH sometime around late 2025 or early 2026. I just need to send a frame out to be ISO tested after a few small details are wrapped up and revised.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Frame-07.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Frame-07.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Frame-07.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Frame-07.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Frame-04.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Frame-04.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Frame-04.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Frame-04.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Frame-05.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Frame-05.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Frame-05.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Snakedriver-Steel-Frame-05.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>But I’ve been pounding on these bikes for the past 2 years and have been neglecting them. That’s something I rarely do with my personal bikes, but the past two end-of-season maintenance cycles? Bearings are smooth as can be, and all pivots are as good as new. I have not had to change bearings in over two years of service. Maintenance was a breeze, which was something I spent a good amount of design time on the front end contemplating and making sure things were easy to maintain and relatively quick to manufacture.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Many thanks to Kris for sharing!
