The two reportedly battled over who would spearhead Siri's new capabilities, with both ultimately receiving pieces of the project.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Intelligence faced significant delays after internal testing revealed Siri was inaccurate on nearly a third of requests. Apple subsequently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/\">admitted</a> that it would take longer than expected to roll out the more personalized ‌Siri‌ experience, and that these features will be rolled out \"in the coming year.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, according to the report, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/11/apple-delayed-siri-features-this-fall/\">still plans to release its enhanced Siri experience this fall</a>. The functionality includes personal context, onscreen awareness, and improved app integration. Some Apple executives reportedly aren't concerned about the delay, and believe competitors haven't perfected AI either, giving Apple time to get it right.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFollowing the delay, software chief Craig Federighi reorganized executives, removing responsibility for the new Siri from Giannandrea and reassigning it to Mike Rockwell, who leads the Vision Pro division. The details of Apple's Siri team changes and the delayed Siri revamp were previously reported by <em><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/14/apple-siri-team-reassurance/\">Bloomberg</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/chaos-behind-siri-revealed/\">The Information</a></em>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor more details on Apple's internal issues, including political infighting, budget constraints, and talent drain, see <em>The New York Times</em>' <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/technology/apple-issues-trump-tariffs.html\">full report</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nytimes-com/\">New York Times</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/11/apple-ai-struggles-2023-chip-budget-dispute/\">NYT: Apple's AI Struggles Began with 2023 Chip Budget Dispute</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nyt-apples-ai-struggles-began-with-2023-chip-budget-dispute.2455123/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c818f08d628743735238253dc253080e2883d4d78370f50427b1f3dfe1d56b2d","category":"Apple"}
