We know that $10 off isn’t an absolutely massive discount, but if you’re planning to buy a pair of Apple earbuds, which only became available for purchase last Friday, you might as well save a few bucks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2464323/airpods-4-vs-old-airpods-compared.html\">Apple’s update to the AirPods</a> delivers a new design that’s meant to make them more comfortable to wear. The earbuds also feature the brand new H2 chip, which enables better audio quality, voice isolation, and some awesome Siri interactions. Talking of which, you don’t just get to talk to Siri now, you also get to have fun with head gestures. If you ask Siri a question, you can then nod your head to confirm a command or announcement or shake your head to decline it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned, the ANC version is also on sale and it’s the first open-ear model to come with this feature, thus far. You will, however, have to pay that little extra for this feature. We <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2463401/airpods-4-with-anc-review.html\">reviewed the higher-end model</a> and loved the design and features, as well as the long battery life. You can get about 30 hours of use with the charging case and about 5 hours of continuous listening. If you get the ANC version, you’ll have to recharge the earbuds quicker, as you get about 4 hours of actual use with ANC turned on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go ahead and take advantage of the first discount for the Apple AirPods 4. The regular <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z\">AirPods 4 are down to $119 at Amazon</a>, while the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ7HYG1\">AirPods 4 with ANC are $169</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"938ab51f0634fa1af302e1ed71c0aacecc5362f5e014b3d38f970ae96807a070","category":"Apple"}
