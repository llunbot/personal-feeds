{"title":"Tip of the Day: Finding Unknown ‘Items’ in Your iCloud Photo Library","link":"https://mastodon.social/@calebhailey/111653442283836729","date":1704323059000,"content":"\n<p>For at least a few years, I’ve been mildly annoyed by the fact that my iCloud Photo Library reported containing something like “50,783 Photos, 3,643 Videos, 2 Items”. The counts for photos and videos weren’t the problem — the problem was the “2 Items”. <em>What were they?</em></p>\n\n<p>Caleb Hailey had the same problem, and posted a super-simple solution to Mastodon: a custom smart album for Photos for Mac with a dozen or so criteria like this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Filename does not include “.jpeg”</li>\n<li>Filename does not include “.png”</li>\n<li>Filename does not include “.heic”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>and so forth. A few minutes of busy work and I found my culprits: two AAC audio files that were each just a few seconds long, and seemingly empty. I have no idea how or when they got into my Photos library but I’m delighted to have them gone.</p>\n\n<p>Worth pointing out: You don’t need to build up a list every single filename extension that’s an image or video that you <em>do</em> want to keep in Photos. Once I built up a list of excluded filename extensions that whittled the list of matching items to 32, I just went through the items visually. The two AAC files stuck out like sore thumbs.</p>\n\n<p>Also worth pointing out: You cannot create smart albums in Photos on iPadOS or iOS. Only MacOS. (Same thing goes for smart mailboxes in Apple Mail.) Apple still treats the iPad and iPhone as <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/07/safari-chrome-firebox-multiple-tab-selection\">baby computers</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2016/02/apples_app_problem\">A similar problem I had back in 2016</a>, in which I had five unnamed items in my Photos library that could not be synced to iCloud. The solution to that one was also a smart album — and thus also a problem that could only be solved using a Mac.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/03/unknown-items-in-icloud-photos\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f5be885ded234f7c2e43f3a43405e0dce980ddf5621184a16f2f078d75b06f91","category":"Tech"}
