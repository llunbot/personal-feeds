This spiffy kit includes two length press rods sized specifically for hub or suspension applications, a pair of interchangeable Liner Quick Handles along with a full complement of bearing guides and receiver cups to ensure efficient and accurate bearing removal and installation.</p>\n<p>The Linear Bearing Press utilizes the same 29 degree angle Acme thread design found in high precision applications such lead screw drives for CNC machines. This design results in wider and broader thread bases which have greater strength and overall durability. Most importantly, this thread design is much more accurate than standard V shaped threads providing exact 90 degree force for perfect bearing seating and installation alignment.</p>\n<p>Unlike other bearing press products available which specify a plain bushing or no bearing at all, each Linear Press rod features a static nut fitted with a precision needle bearing set with ground surfaces to provide smooth and accurate, bind-free action.</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://cycling.endurobearings.com/products/enduro-brt-060-linear-press-bearing-service-toolset\" target=\"_blank\">Enduro Bearings</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/paul_barbhoodie_back-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/paul_barbhoodie_back-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/paul_barbhoodie_back-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/paul_barbhoodie_back-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/paul_barbhoodie_back-scaled.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/paul_barbhoodie_back-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/paul_barbhoodie_back-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/paul_barbhoodie_back-scaled.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/paul_barbhoodie_back-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/paul_barbhoodie_back-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.paulcomp.com/shop/accessories-apparel/apparel/barbarian-sweatshirt/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Component Engineering Barbarian Hoodies Return</a> $62</h3>\n<p>In our world, there are two barbarian references worth repeating.
