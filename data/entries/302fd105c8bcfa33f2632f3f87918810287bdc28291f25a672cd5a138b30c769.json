With a lightweight wide 30mm internal carbon rim, the new FFWD Outlaw wheels can cover everything from cross-country to marathon to trail to all-mountain, and surprisingly, they’re now 25% cheaper than when the Outlaw debuted all the way back in 2016!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>FFWD Outlaw carbon trail MTB wheels</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_mountain-bikes.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_mountain-bikes.jpg\" alt=\"new 2023 FFWD Outlaw affordable lightweight carbon XC trail all-mountain MTB wheels, moutnain bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_mountain-bikes.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_mountain-bikes-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_mountain-bikes-800x400.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_mountain-bikes-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_mountain-bikes-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_mountain-bikes-1536x768.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>all c. FFWD</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the mountain bike side of things, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ffwd-outlaw-mountain-bike-wheels-move-brand-onto-dirt/\" target=\"_blank\">the Outlaw name</a> was first used by FFWD back in 2016 for a pair of light carbon 24mm internal cross-country wheels that were even ridden to a World Champion XC Marathon title, plus a slightly heavier, wider all-mountain version. Now with more modern updated spec and a much more capable 30mm internal hookless carbon rim, the Outlaw is back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new FFWD Outlaw is still designed first for cross-country and marathon riding, around wider modern tires. And thanks to improved materials and that wider hookless rim, FFWD says the new affordable carbon wheels are rated up to all-mountain riding, too!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_rim-section.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_rim-section-800x400.jpg\" alt=\"new 2023 FFWD Outlaw affordable lightweight carbon XC trail all-mountain MTB wheels, rim section profile\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_rim-section-800x400.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_rim-section-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_rim-section-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_rim-section-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_rim-section.jpg 1000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The core new element of the new Outlaw is its wide new hookless carbon rim – 30mm internal, 37mm external, by 26mm deep. It gets newly wider beads to better resist trailside impacts for longer life, and reinforced spoke holes for that extra durability which means it can now blur the lines between lightweight trail-riding mountain bike disciplines. With that wide rim, it’s even rated for wider tires – anything from 2.0″ up to 2.75″ officially!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_new-36T-ratchet-Boost-hub.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_new-36T-ratchet-Boost-hub.jpg\" alt=\"new 2023 FFWD Outlaw affordable lightweight carbon XC trail all-mountain MTB wheels, new allot Boost Ratchet hubs 36T engagement\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_new-36T-ratchet-Boost-hub.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_new-36T-ratchet-Boost-hub-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_new-36T-ratchet-Boost-hub-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_new-36T-ratchet-Boost-hub-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_new-36T-ratchet-Boost-hub-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>FFWD also has a new aluminum Boost MTB hubset for the new Outlaw, with a centerlock disc interface so you can fit any mountain bike rotors to it – with adapters in the case of 6-bolt rotors. The new hubs also get an upgrade to 36T ratchet internals thanks to that DT tech entering the public domain a couple years back, and spin on premium sealed steel cartridge bearings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_rim-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_rim-detail.jpg\" alt=\"new 2023 FFWD Outlaw affordable lightweight carbon XC trail all-mountain MTB wheels, rim detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_rim-detail.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_rim-detail-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_rim-detail-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_rim-detail-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FFWD-Outlaw-affordable-lightweight-carbon-XC-trail-all-mountain-MTB-wheels_rim-detail-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new FFWD Outlaw wheels are 29er only, and Boost-only.
