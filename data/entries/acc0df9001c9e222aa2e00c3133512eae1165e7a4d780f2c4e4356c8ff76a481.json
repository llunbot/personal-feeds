We knew that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacemaker_(TV_series)\"><em>Peacemaker</em></a> was being written and directed by James Gunn (<em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>), and that the series will explore the origins of the character and his subsequent missions. And now we have our first look, thanks to HBO Max, which <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2021/10/james-gunn-peacemaker-premiere-date-teaser-trailer-hbo-max-dc-fandome-1234856822/\">released</a> an extended teaser trailer for the series during the DC FanDome event.</p>\n<p><strong>(A couple of spoilers for <em>The Suicide Squad</em> below.)</strong></p>\n<p>Gunn wrote the series last summer during the COVID-19 lockdown, just for fun, but then DC Films approached him about a possible spinoff series for one of the characters in <em>The Suicide Squad</em>. I'm not sure Peacemaker would have been my first choice—Cena's performance was terrific, but I haven't quite forgiven the character for the Very Bad Thing he did in that film—but Gunn's instincts are pretty impeccable, and he clearly felt there was more story to tell.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804724#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804724&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"acc0df9001c9e222aa2e00c3133512eae1165e7a4d780f2c4e4356c8ff76a481","category":"Tech"}
