You get the ultraportability of an ultraportable from lightweight builds measuring under 1 inch thick. When you don't need an old-school physical keyboard, you can switch to tablet mode, and with touchscreen and stylus options, creative work seems more attainable, too.</p>\n<p>But problems with battery life, heat management, durability, and audio quality often come with that oh-so-versatile approach. The MSI E13 Flip Evo isn't completely immune to all these issues, but it evolves the story around convertibles that insist on being under an inch thick.</p>\n<p>Hailing from MSI's business- and productivity-focused Summit series of machines, the E13 (there's also a 16-inch <a href=\"https://www.msi.com/Business-Productivity/Summit-E16-Flip-A11X-RTX/Overview\" target=\"_blank\">E16</a> with Nvidia RTX options) starts at a <a href=\"https://www.costco.com/msi-summit-13.4%22-touchscreen-intel-evo-platform-laptop---11th-gen-intel-core-i7-1195g7---1920-x-1200-fhd%2B-display%2C-black.product.100809103.html\" target=\"_blank\">$1,300</a> MSRP and goes up to $1,900. (We've <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3n9TVSo\" target=\"_blank\">spotted it for $1,800</a>.) With its lightweight, trim aluminum build, shiny accents, and dedicated pen, the machine is a clear rival for premium ultraportables like Dell's XPS line and Microsoft's Surface offerings.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1803973#p3\">Read 50 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1803973&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1da3b433931efd1bd9a8f521cffd41512b07958348f6ea7e8d93219c21372657","category":"Tech"}
