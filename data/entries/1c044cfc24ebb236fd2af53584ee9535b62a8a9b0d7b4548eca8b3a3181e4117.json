It does, however, provide another hint as to where the future of high-end drivetrains may lie.</p>\n<p>Here’s what we know so far.</p>\n<h2>What is SRAM T-Type?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> SRAM’s new T-Type Eagle Transmission uses a direct-mount rear derailleur.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Before, we look at Shimano’s patent, let’s quickly cast an eye back at <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-t-type-eagle-transmission/\">SRAM’s new T-Type Eagle Transmission</a>, launched only last week.</p>\n<p>In one of the most significant developments in drivetrain design in a number of years, T-Type Eagle combines SRAM’s existing Universal Derailleur Hanger standard with a new, direct-mount rear derailleur.</p>\n<p>The new derailleur has no B-tension or limit screw adjustment, and doesn’t need a derailleur hanger. Instead, it <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-install-and-set-up-sram-t-type-eagle/\">mounts directly to the bike’s frame</a> at the dropout.</p>\n<p>The derailleur has user-replaceable components and, all told, SRAM says the new T-Type Transmission is intended to increase drivetrain robustness and reliability, improve shifting under load and offer easier setup.

This looks similar to a B-gap screw on the rear of the mount and will likely be used for the initial setup of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/a-complete-guide-to-rear-derailleurs/\">rear derailleur</a>.</p>\n<p>This could also suggest that Shimano’s design is intended to work with different <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/bike-cassettes/\">cassette sizes</a>. By comparison, SRAM’s T-Type derailleur forgoes the B-gap screw as it is designed to specifically work with a 10-52t cassette.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A screw is used to set the angular adjustment of the derailleur.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Shimano</i></span></div>\n<p>Shimano says the B-gap screw improves usability because it “allows for easy adjustment of the angular position of the rear derailleur relative to the frame of the bicycle”.</p>\n<p>The patent application shows the setup tool needed. This measures the number of teeth on the cassette to help line up the derailleur correctly.</p>\n<p>The patent document also specifies the thickness of the two arms that fit around the dropout. It says these arms will have a radial thickness of at least 2mm to increase the rigidity of the rear derailleur.</p>\n<h2>How does Shimano’s patent compare to SRAM T-Type?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Is Shimano working on a direct-mount rear derailleur?</span></figcaption><span> <i>Shimano</i></span></div>\n<p>Shimano’s patent depicts a similar-looking design to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-t-type-eagle-transmission/\">SRAM’s T-Type rear derailleur</a>.</p>\n<p>Notably, Shimano’s drawing shows two arms sandwiching the rear dropout.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> SRAM’s T-Type is mounted around the axle, enabling it to work with a wide range of bikes that use the UDH dropout.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As with the T-Type mount, Shimano’s patent drawing shows the rear axle screwing into a thread used to mount the derailleur, centring the derailleur around a constant point of reference.</p>\n<p>Ahead of launching the T-Type Eagle Transmission, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-universal-derailleur-hanger/\">SRAM introduced the Universal Derailleur Hanger dropout standard in 2019</a>.</p>\n<p>A bike must use UDH in order to be compatible with SRAM T-Type’s Hangerless Interface and, in turn, accept the T-Type rear derailleur.</p>\n<p>Shimano’s drawings hint at a similar design, though at this stage we’re unable to comment on how it might influence frame design and, significantly, any cross-compatibility with SRAM’s UDH standard.</p>\n<h2>Will Shimano go direct-mount?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Shimano’s drawing shows the design depicted on a mountain bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Shimano</i></span></div>\n<p>This patent application suggests Shimano may add a true direct-mount option to its mountain bike range.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, Shimano appears to be following SRAM, but this would not be Shimano’s first foray into direct-mount derailleurs – at least in name.</p>\n<p>Shimano’s Direct-Mount Rear Derailleur (DRD) standard, which debuted in 2012, replaced the upper link of traditional hangers, connecting the frame to the upper pivot of compatible derailleurs.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Shimano’s existing Direct-Mount Rear Derailleur (DRD) design replaced the upper link of traditional hangers.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Shimano</i></span></div>\n<p>However, this still sees the derailleur mounted below the dropout.</p>\n<p>Shimano’s latest patent shows the first design from the Japanese firm whereby the derailleur is mounted directly to the axle/dropout.</p>\n<p>Will we see Shimano’s patent come to life?
