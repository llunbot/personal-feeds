The feature bears similarities to a feature called <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/anthropics-latest-best-ai-model-is-twice-as-fast-and-still-terrible-at-dad-jokes/#page-2\">Artifacts</a> in Anthropic's Claude AI assistant, introduced in June. Canvas displays content in a separate window alongside the AI chat history, allowing users to keep an eye on working document drafts or programming code while collaborating with the AI assistant.</p>\n<p>OpenAI began rolling out canvas to ChatGPT Plus and Team users globally on Thursday, while Enterprise and Education users will gain access next week. The company also plans to make canvas available to all free ChatGPT users once it exits the beta stage.</p>\n<p>Like Artifacts, Canvas is sort of a scratch pad, a way to visually separate portions of the active working context (the user prompt) to keep them from getting lost in the chat backlog. From our experience, Artifacts can ease the process of working on projects with Claude that require editing and revisions, and Canvas functions in a very similar way.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/openais-canvas-eases-collaborations-with-chatgpt/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/openais-canvas-eases-collaborations-with-chatgpt/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"33af6d7e7718c4dc770fd8ef1d5305d0438c2287fb6a935755e121a85984f507","category":"Tech"}
