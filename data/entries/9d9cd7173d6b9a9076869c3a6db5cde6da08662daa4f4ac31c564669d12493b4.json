There was a standard AirPort Express, a higher-end AirPort Extreme with more advanced networking features, and an AirPort Time Capsule that doubled as an external storage drive for backing up a Mac with Time Machine.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/Apple-AirPort-Routers.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" />\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/04/26/apple-officially-discontinues-airport-wireless-router-lineup/\">discontinued the AirPort line in 2018</a>, but the company could return to the Wi-Fi router market in an unexpected way in the future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBack in December, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-custom-bluetooth-wifi-chip/\">developing its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip</a> that will debut <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/homepod-mini-2-and-new-apple-tv-launch-timing/\">in new Apple TV and HomePod mini models later this year</a>. He said the chip is \"so sophisticated\" that it could <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/22/apple-not-working-on-new-airport-routers/\">\"theoretically\" turn these devices into a wireless access point</a>. However, it is unclear if Apple will actually follow through with that idea, so temper your expectations for the time being.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is reportedly aiming to make a bigger push into smart home products, with the company rumored to be planning an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/10/apple-home-hub-still-months-away/\">all-new smart home hub for release later this year</a>. Apple is also said to be planning a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/apple-smart-home-camera-rumor/\">HomeKit-enabled smart home camera</a> that can connect to the hub, and together the products could serve as a home security system. If future Apple TV and/or HomePod models could effectively double as AirPort routers for Wi-Fi, that would be another way for Apple to expand its presence in the smart home market.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's chip will support Wi-Fi 6E, according to Gurman, whereas the final AirPort models supported what is now known as Wi-Fi 5. However, Apple supply chain analyst Jeff Pu believes the chip will actually <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/iphone-17-air-wifi-7-rumor/\">support Wi-Fi 7</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt remains to be seen if the Apple TV and HomePod actually become Wi-Fi routers, but Apple is seemingly developing technology that allows for it.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/01/apple-airport-could-return-in-unexpected-way/\">Apple's Discontinued Line of AirPort Wi-Fi Routers Could Return in an Unexpected Way</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-discontinued-line-of-airport-wi-fi-routers-could-return-in-an-unexpected-way.2451073/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9d9cd7173d6b9a9076869c3a6db5cde6da08662daa4f4ac31c564669d12493b4","category":"Apple"}
