Apple is now providing weekly beta updates, seeding out the sixth beta today.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/General-iOS-17-Feature-Blue-Green.jpg\" alt width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nAs we approach the end of the beta testing period, updates are getting smaller with Apple focusing on crucial refinements and polish, but there are still a few changes in the latest beta worth highlighting.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Messages App</h2>\r<br />\nIn the Messages app, you <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-beta-6-bug-fixes-changes-and-improvements.2398734/post-32384825\">can now long press</a> on the \"+\" button to bring up the photo picker rather than tapping and having to choose the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> option from the list.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Phone App</h2>\r<br />\nIn an earlier beta, Apple moved the red end call button in the Phone app from the bottom middle of the interface to the bottom right. Given that people are so used to tapping in the middle, this was not a popular change.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/ios-17-beta-six-phone-app.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nIn beta 6, Apple moved the end call button <a href=\"https://twitter.com/M1Astra/status/1691553355007422919\">back to the middle</a>, returning it to where it is located in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/\">iOS 16</a> and earlier.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Mood Tracking</h2>\r<br />\nApple has further tweaked the animations that are used for the moods in the mood tracking feature. The rings around each mood now animate quicker around each shape, and there are more rings.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/ios-17-beta-6-mood-tracking.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Photos Splash Screen</h2>\r<br />\nThere's a new splash screen when you first open the ‌Photos‌ app, and it lets you know about the new features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/ios-17-photos-splash-screen.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Display &amp; Brightness</h2>\r<br />\nIn the Display &amp; Brightness section of the Settings app, the wallpaper icon has been updated to an ‌iOS 17‌ wallpaper.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/ios-17-beta-6-settings.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n<h2>More iOS 17 Beta 6 Features</h2>\r<br />\nKnow of a feature that we left out in this list?
