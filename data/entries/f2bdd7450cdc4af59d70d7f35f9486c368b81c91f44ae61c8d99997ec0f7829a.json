The steps you need to complete to install the software on your device are provided towards the end of this article, but before you jump ahead, here are a few things worth considering.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Is My iPhone Compatible With iOS 18?</h2>\r<br />\niOS 18 is compatible with the same iPhone models as iOS 17, so that includes the following devices:\r<br />\n<div>\r<br />\n<ul><li>iPhone 15</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 15 Plus</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 15 Pro</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 15 Pro Max</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 14</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 14 Plus</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 14 Pro</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 14 Pro Max</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 13</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 13 mini</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 13 Pro</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 13 Pro Max</li></ul></div><div>\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 12</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 12 mini</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 12 Pro</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 12 Pro Max</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 11</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 11 Pro</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 11 Pro Max</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone XS</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone XS Max</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone XR</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone SE (2nd generation)</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone SE (3rd generation)</li></ul></div>\r<br />\n<div></div>iPadOS 18 drops support for iPad models with the A10X Fusion chip, used in the 10.5-inch iPad Pro and second-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro. The sixth-generation iPad is also being dropped from the compatibility list, but the seventh-generation iPad is still supported. That means iPadOS 18 is compatible with the following iPad models:\r<br />\n<div><ul><li>iPad Pro: 2018 and later</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPad Air: 2019 and later</li></ul></div><div>\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n<li>iPad mini: 2019 and later</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPad: 2020 and later</li></ul></div>\r<br />\n<div></div>If you're unsure which ‌iPad‌ model you have, go to <strong>Settings -&gt; General -&gt; About</strong>, and you'll find the Model Name listed there.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Should I Install iOS 18 Public Beta?</h2>\r<br />\nBefore downloading the update, it's worth noting that Apple does not recommend installing the iOS 18 Beta on your main iPhone, so if you have a secondary device, use that. This is beta software, which means there are often bugs and issues that pop up that can prevent software from working properly or cause other problems. If you're concerned about potential issues, hold off on installing and wait for Apple to launch its final stable release later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div><h2>Make an Archived Backup of Your Device First</h2>\r<br />\nBefore installing the beta, make sure to <strong>back up your iOS device</strong> before installing the software using the following method, otherwise you won't be able to revert back to iOS 17 if things go wrong.\r<br />\n<ol>\r<br />\n \t<li>Plug your iPhone into your Mac using the supplied cable.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Allow the accessory to connect by clicking <strong>Allow</strong> in the dialog prompt.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Open a <strong>Finder</strong> window by clicking the Finder icon in the Dock.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Click your iOS device's name in the sidebar.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/archived-backup2.jpg\" alt=\"finder\" width=\"2264\" height=\"1592\" />\r<br />\n \t</li><li>If this is the first time connecting your device to your Mac, click <strong>Trust</strong> in the Finder window.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/archived-backup1.jpg\" alt=\"finder\" width=\"2030\" height=\"1408\" />\r<br />\n \t</li><li>Tap <strong>Trust</strong> on your device when prompted, then enter your passcode to confirm.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>In the General tab, click the circle next to where it says <strong>Back up all of the data on your iPad to this Mac</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>If you want to encrypt the backup, check the box next to <strong>Encrypt local backup</strong>, then enter a password to protect your data.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>If you don't want to create an encrypted backup, or you've already set up encrypted backups, click <strong>Back Up Now</strong>. When the backup is finished, you can find the date and time of the last backup in the <strong>General</strong> tab, just above the Manage Backups button. \r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/archived-backup3.jpg\" alt=\"finder\" width=\"1990\" height=\"1364\" />\r<br />\n</li><li>Lastly, archive the backup: Select <strong>Manage Backups ➝ Select Backup</strong>, then right-click the backup and choose <strong>Archive</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n</ol>\r<br />\nRemember that this backup will not be overwritten when you manually or automatically back up your iPhone in the future, so you can restore it at any time by using the <strong>Restore Backup...</strong> option in the same Finder screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>How to Download iOS 18 Public Beta</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/apple-beta-software-program.jpg\" width=\"2774\" height=\"1494\" /><ol>\r<br />\n \t<li>On your iOS device, open up Safari and navigate to the <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/\">Apple Beta Software Program website</a>.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Tap the <strong>Sign up</strong> button and enter your Apple ID credentials, or sign in with your Apple ID if you've signed up to beta test a previous update.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Agree to the Apple Beta Software Program terms and conditions if required.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>After signing in, you'll see a main screen that's a Guide for Public Betas.

On your iPhone, go to <a href=\"http://beta.apple.com/profile\">beta.apple.com/profile</a> to download the configuration profile. Your iPhone will notify you when the profile has been downloaded. Open <strong>Settings</strong>, tap the profile and follow the onscreen instructions to allow installation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iOS 18 Features</h2>\r<br />\n‌iOS 18 introduces Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features deeply integrated into the operating system.
