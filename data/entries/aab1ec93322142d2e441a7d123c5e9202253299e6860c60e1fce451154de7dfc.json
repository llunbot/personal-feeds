Prime members shopped for millions of deals and saved billions across more than 35 categories globally.</p> \n<p>I live in South Korea, but luckily I was staying in Seattle to attend the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/\">AWS Heroes Summit</a> during Prime Day 2024. I signed up for a <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/how-to-sign-up-for-a-prime-membership\">Prime membership</a> and used <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-rufus\">Rufus</a>, my new AI-powered conversational shopping assistant, to search for items quickly and easily. Prime members in the U.S. like me chose to consolidate their deliveries on millions of orders during Prime Day, saving an estimated 10 million trips. This consolidation results in lower carbon emissions on average.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/07/29/2024-amazon-primeday-powered-by-aws.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" /></p> \n<p>We know from Jeff’s annual blog post that AWS runs the Amazon website and mobile app that makes these short-term, large scale global events feasible. (check out his <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/how-aws-powered-amazons-biggest-day-ever/\">2016</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/prime-day-2017-powered-by-aws/\">2017</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-prime-day-2019-powered-by-aws/\">2019</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-prime-day-2020-powered-by-aws/\">2020</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/prime-day-2021-two-chart-topping-days/\">2021</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-prime-day-2022-aws-for-the-win/\">2022</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/prime-day-2023-powered-by-aws-all-the-numbers/\">2023</a> posts for a look back). Today I want to share top numbers from AWS that made my amazing shopping experience possible.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Prime Day 2024 – all the numbers</u></strong><br /> Here are some of the most interesting and/or mind-blowing metrics:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\"><strong>Amazon EC2</strong></a> – Since many of <a href=\"http://amazon.com/\">Amazon.com</a> services such as Rufus and Search use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/\">AWS artificial intelligence</a> (AI) chips under the hood, Amazon deployed a cluster of over 80,000 <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/\">Inferentia</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/trainium/\">Trainium</a> chips for Prime Day. During Prime Day 2024, Amazon used over 250K <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/\">AWS Graviton</a> chips to power more than 5,800 distinct Amazon.com services (double that of 2023).</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ebs\"><strong>Amazon EBS </strong></a>– In support of Prime Day, Amazon provisioned 264 PiB of Amazon EBS storage in 2024, a 62 percent increase compared to 2023. When compared to the day before Prime Day 2024, Amazon.com performance on Amazon EBS jumped by 5.6 trillion read/write I/O operations during the event, or an increase of 64 percent compared to Prime Day 2023. Also, when compared to the day before Prime Day 2024, Amazon.com transferred an incremental 444 petabytes of data during the event, or an increase of 81 percent compared to Prime Day 2023.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/07/29/Prime-Day-2024_EBS-visual_v2.png\" width=\"2098\" height=\"1180\" /></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/aurora\"><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong></a> – On Prime Day, 6,311 database instances running the PostgreSQL-compatible and MySQL-compatible editions of Amazon Aurora processed more than 376 billion transactions, stored 2,978 terabytes of data, and transferred 913 terabytes of data.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb\"><strong>Amazon DynamoDB</strong></a> – DynamoDB powers multiple high-traffic Amazon properties and systems including Alexa, the Amazon.com sites, and all Amazon fulfillment centers. Over the course of Prime Day, these sources made tens of trillions of calls to the DynamoDB API. DynamoDB maintained high availability while delivering single-digit millisecond responses and peaking at 146 million requests per second.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache\"><strong>Amazon ElastiCache</strong></a> – ElastiCache served more than quadrillion requests on a single day with a peak of over 1 trillion requests per minute.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight\"><strong>Amazon QuickSight</strong></a> – Over the course of Prime Day 2024, one Amazon QuickSight dashboard used by Prime Day teams saw 107K unique hits, 1300+ unique visitors, and delivered over 1.6M queries.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker\"><strong>Amazon SageMaker </strong></a>– SageMaker processed more than 145B inference requests during Prime Day.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ses\"><strong>Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES)</strong> </a>– SES sent 30 percent more emails for Amazon.com during Prime Day 2024 vs 2023, delivering 99.23 percent of those emails to customers.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty\"><strong>Amazon GuardDuty </strong></a>– During Prime Day 2024, Amazon GuardDuty monitored nearly 6 trillion log events per hour, a 31.9% increase from the previous year’s Prime Day.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail\"><strong>AWS CloudTrail</strong></a> – CloudTrail processed over 976 billion events in support of Prime Day 2024.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront\"><strong>Amazon CloudFront </strong></a>– CloudFront handled a peak load of over 500 million HTTP requests per minute, for a total of over 1.3 trillion HTTP requests during Prime Day 2024, a 30 percent increase in total requests compared to Prime Day 2023.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Prepare to Scale</u></strong><br /> As Jeff noted in every year, rigorous preparation is key to the success of Prime Day and our other large-scale events. For example, 733 <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fis\">AWS Fault Injection Service</a> experiments were run to test resilience and ensure Amazon.com remains highly available on Prime Day.</p> \n<p>If you are preparing for a similar business-critical events, product launches, and migrations, I strongly recommend that you take advantage of newly-branded <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/aws-countdown/\">AWS Countdown</a>, a support program designed for your project lifecycle to assess operational readiness, identify and mitigate risks, and plan capacity, using proven playbooks developed by AWS experts. For example, with additional help from AWS Countdown, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo3HrxDU-HM\">Legal Zoom</a> successfully migrated 450 servers with minimal issues and continues to leverage <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/aws-countdown/\">AWS Countdown Premium</a> to streamline and expedite the launch of SaaS applications.</p> \n<p>We look forward to seeing what other records will be broken next year!</p> \n<p>— <a href=\"https://twitter.com/channyun\">Channy</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffbarr\">Jeff</a>;</p>","author":"Channy Yun (윤석찬)","siteTitle":"AWS News Blog","siteHash":"6093e072e4117ec22616e844cb857d03ca62c57a411a8affc77cb5e8b6b15bf6","entryHash":"aab1ec93322142d2e441a7d123c5e9202253299e6860c60e1fce451154de7dfc","category":"Tech"}
