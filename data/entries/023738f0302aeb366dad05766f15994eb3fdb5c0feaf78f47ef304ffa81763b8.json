And then followed up with more details at last summer’s Eurobike. But while those bikes looked finished, there was still some refinement to be done on the design. Now finally, Rondo officially launch their new Ruut CF Gen 2 carbon gravel bike, and you can get it at your local dealer now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what makes it special (and what’s changed) besides the fact that it’s kinda missing the lower half of its seattube?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We rode the new gravel bike to see how it stacked up against the original adjustable geometry gravel bike!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rondo Ruut g2 CF unique 2nd generation carbon gravel bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rondo Ruut G2 CF1 Review, adjustable geometry carbon gravel bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rondo-ruut-2-0-carbon-gravel-bike-with-broken-seat-tube-beats-specialized-to-the-punch/\" target=\"_blank\">we got a first tease</a> of Rondo’s gen 2 Ruut, its interrupted seattube was the big news.

By redirecting the seattube forward midway, there’s more opportunity for vertical flex, without necessarily losing stiffness in all other directions. To get the most flex out of the almost-parallelogram rear quadrilateral (<em>sorry, no more triangles, here</em>) the new bike also gets super dropped seatstays to match the now symmetric dropped chainstays.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_broken-seattube-while-riding.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_broken-seattube-while-riding.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rondo Ruut G2 CF1 Review, adjustable geometry carbon gravel bike, riding with a broken seattube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_broken-seattube-while-riding.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_broken-seattube-while-riding-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_broken-seattube-while-riding-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_broken-seattube-while-riding-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_broken-seattube-while-riding-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_broken-seattube-while-riding-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_broken-seattube-while-riding-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rondo describes the unique look as a move to bring some vertical compliance into the otherwise boxy carbon frame. But also just to create a bike that looks different in a sea of same-ness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rondo calls the new bike both “significantly more comfortable and stable”. Comfort mostly from its unique shaping, and that added stability from completely reworked geometry.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>All-new adjustable gravel geometry</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-reveiw-non-driveside.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-reveiw-non-driveside.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rondo Ruut G2 CF1 Review, adjustable geometry carbon gravel bike, riding non-driveside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-reveiw-non-driveside.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-reveiw-non-driveside-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-reveiw-non-driveside-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-reveiw-non-driveside-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-reveiw-non-driveside-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-reveiw-non-driveside-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-reveiw-non-driveside-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ruut’s gravel geometry hadn’t really changed much at all since its groundbreaking debut <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bfs2017-rondo-ruut-adjustable-geometry-fat-gravel-bikes-eu-upstart-carbon-alloy-steel/\" target=\"_blank\">back in 2017</a>. Already then, Rondo offer the uniquely adjustable geometry with fork flip chips to let you pick a <em>Race</em> or <em>Endurance</em> feel to the bike. It was a smart move ahead of its time, letting early gravel adopters get both a race-ready and bikepacking-ready bike in one.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rondo Ruut G2 CF1 adjustable geometry carbon gravel bike, updated geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry-297x134.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry-1536x691.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry-120x54.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry-768x346.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What has changed in this update is relatively minor, including extended frame Reach and higher Stack with taller headtubes for a more comfortable position, presumably inspired by the Mylc. Plus, a 0.5° slacker head angle for a bit more stability, with the same short 420mm chainstays and some extra standover clearance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But just as big news, is the addition of a new fifth size, the new XS with 650b wheels takes advantage of the longer/higher rider position to squeeze one size back in, either for smaller riders or those who prefer the shorter/lower fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_studio-NDS.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_studio-NDS.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rondo Ruut G2 CF1 adjustable geometry carbon gravel bike, NDS detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_studio-NDS.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_studio-NDS-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_studio-NDS-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_studio-NDS-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_studio-NDS-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new boxy carbon frame features a kinked toptube, interrupted seattube, and symmetric rear end. Cable routing is fully integrated internally, through the massive new CNC machined in Poland alloy stem and into the Acros headset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up front is an ultra-deep redesigned TwinTip fork, with a giant non-driveside wing that smooths air over the flat mount front brake. The new fork carries over Rondo’s unique TwinTip flip-chip offering 10mm of axle-to-crown height &amp; 10mm offset adjustment that alters your head angle by 0.7°, reshaping the gravel bike’s ride character.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_two-bottles.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_two-bottles.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rondo Ruut G2 CF1 Review, adjustable geometry carbon gravel bike, two bottle cages\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_two-bottles.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_two-bottles-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_two-bottles-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_two-bottles-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_two-bottles-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_two-bottles-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of mounting points for accessories. Two sets of cage mounts on top of the downtube will fit 2 full-size bottle on Medium and larger frames. Then, there’s a set of mounts under the downtube and a toptube bag mount. Plus, there’s a 5th set of mounts above where you would normally find a front derailleur, where we’ve been told a custom bolt-on bag could be placed. There are even mounts for full coverage fenders, but it’s gonna be a pretty custom setup due to the unique frame shaping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Ruut is obviously 1x only with no place to hang a front derailleur, right?

It gets an asymmetrical T47/77 threaded bottom bracket, that is SRAM power meter compatible. And now there’s a UDH for T-type drivetrain compatibility.

And a bit contrary to Rondo’s descriptions, I would say that it was one of the stiffest riding gravel bikes I have ridden in recent memory. That’s not entirely a good or bad thing, but something to keep in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_Review_riding.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_Review_riding.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rondo Ruut G2 CF1 Review, adjustable geometry carbon gravel bike, smooth\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_Review_riding.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_Review_riding-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_Review_riding-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_Review_riding-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_Review_riding-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With that said, the stiffness felt like it was mostly coming from the front end. It starts with that massive new fork and boxy headtube. And stiffness carries through the stiff machined stem into a quite rigid alloy bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_Review_NDS-angled-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1350\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_Review_NDS-angled-detail.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rondo Ruut G2 CF1 Review, adjustable geometry carbon gravel bike, frame detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_Review_NDS-angled-detail.jpg 1350w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_Review_NDS-angled-detail-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_Review_NDS-angled-detail-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Rondo-Ruut-G2-CF-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_Review_NDS-angled-detail-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As much as it is a strong visual, I don’t feel like the interrupted seat tube offered much noticeable vertical compliance. At least not compared to a more conventional bike design. That’s not really a huge surprise. I suspect the redirected seattube design probably simply offsets extra stiffness from the massive boxy carbon tube shapes everywhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_Murcia-gravel-roads.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_Murcia-gravel-roads.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rondo Ruut G2 CF1 Review, adjustable geometry carbon gravel bike, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_Murcia-gravel-roads.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_Murcia-gravel-roads-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_Murcia-gravel-roads-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_Murcia-gravel-roads-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_Murcia-gravel-roads-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast-rolling 40mm tires are certainly a good choice for speed. But there’s plenty of room up front to get a bigger tire here for more comfort and even improved grip. And I think that if this were my bike, it would greatly benefit from a more compliant handlebar and/or stem. And of course larger volume tires. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All relatively simple tweaks to make. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_9280g-actual-weight.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_9280g-actual-weight.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rondo Ruut G2 CF1 Review, adjustable geometry carbon gravel bike, 9.28kg M actual weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_9280g-actual-weight.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_9280g-actual-weight-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_9280g-actual-weight-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_9280g-actual-weight-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_9280g-actual-weight-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_9280g-actual-weight-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_9280g-actual-weight-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>measured 9.28kg Medium complete with 40mm Tufo tires &amp; tubes, without pedals</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>2024 Rondo Ruut g2 CF – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_CF0.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_CF0.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rondo Ruut G2 CF adjustable geometry carbon gravel bike, CF0\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_CF0.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_CF0-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_CF0-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_CF0-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Rondo-Ruut-g2-CF-unique-2nd-generation-adjustable-geometry-carbon-gravel-bike_CF0-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new 2024 Rondo Ruut g2 CF now comes in four complete 1x builds.
