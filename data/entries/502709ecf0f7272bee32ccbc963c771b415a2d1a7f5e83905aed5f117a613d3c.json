{"title":"Reddit Post Seemingly Proves That Samsung’s Galaxy S-Series ‘Moon Photos’ Are Fake, and They’ve Been Blatantly Lying About Them","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/11nzrb0/samsung_space_zoom_moon_shots_are_fake_and_here/","date":1678568158000,"content":"\n<p>“ibreakphotos”, on Reddit:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many of us have witnessed the breathtaking moon photos taken with\nthe latest zoom lenses, starting with the S20 Ultra. Nevertheless,\nI’ve always had doubts about their authenticity, as they appear\nalmost too perfect. While these images are not necessarily\noutright fabrications, neither are they entirely genuine. Let me\nexplain.</p>\n\n<p>There have been many threads on this, and many people believe that\nthe moon photos are real (<a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/input/reviews/is-samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-using-ai-to-fake-detailed-moon-photos-investigation-super-resolution-analysis\">Input</a>) — even MKBHD has\nclaimed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6P1VRs68Cqo\">in this popular YouTube short</a> that the moon is not\nan overlay, like Huawei has been accused of in the past. But he’s\nnot correct. So, while many have tried to prove that Samsung fakes\nthe moon shots, I think nobody succeeded — until now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here’s how he proved Samsung’s moon photos are a scam: he started with a high-res photo of the moon, downsized it to just 170⁠ ⁠×⁠ ⁠170 pixels, and applied a gaussian blur. He then displayed <a href=\"https://imgur.com/3STX9mZ\">that image, upscaled</a>, on his computer monitor and used a Galaxy S-series phone (he doesn’t say which model) to take a picture of that blurry circle on his display. The phone turned that image into <a href=\"https://imgur.com/ULVX933\">this</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Have to say I’m surprised both <a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/input/reviews/is-samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-using-ai-to-fake-detailed-moon-photos-investigation-super-resolution-analysis\">Raymond Wong</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6P1VRs68Cqo\">Marques Brownlee</a> were taken in by this. These “amazing” moon photos seem impossible optically, and, more tellingly, no one is able to get these Samsung phones to capture similarly “amazing” 100× zoom images of random objects that aren’t the moon.</p>\n\n<p>Anything Samsung ever claims that seems too good to be true should be assumed to be a blatant lie. They’re a corrupt company with a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/18/business/samsung-jay-y-lee-prison-sentence-intl-hnk/index.html\">corrupt culture</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/11/samsung-moon-photos-fake\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"502709ecf0f7272bee32ccbc963c771b415a2d1a7f5e83905aed5f117a613d3c","category":"Tech"}
