A new Apple TV is also expected to be released this year, and it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-tv-homepod-mini-2025-launch/\">will also have an Apple-designed Wi-Fi chip</a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis means the next Apple TV should support Wi-Fi 7, unless Apple chooses to artificially limit the device's specifications.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current Apple TV 4K model from 2022 supports Wi-Fi 6, and the higher-end model also has an Ethernet port for wired internet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is worth noting that Gurman said the Wi-Fi chip that he reported on would support Wi-Fi 6E at a minimum, but it seems unlikely that Apple is developing separate Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 chips, especially considering that all iPhone 17 models already support Wi-Fi 7 with some limitations. All in all, Wi-Fi 7 seems more likely.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWi-Fi 7 allows for data transmission over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously, with a compatible router, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. Wi-Fi 7 can provide peak speeds of over 40 Gbps, a 4Ã— increase over Wi-Fi 6E, provided a device supports the maximum specifications.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new Apple TV is expected to launch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/homepod-mini-2-and-new-apple-tv-launch-timing/\">towards the end of the year</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/iphone-17-new-apple-tv-common-feature/\">New Apple TV This Year Likely to Support Wi-Fi 7</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-tv-this-year-likely-to-support-wi-fi-7.2454371/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b6c4d9fe5e41130bd13d8e7e4308787db5513cae957942ec73eee395cd1e41e1","category":"Apple"}
