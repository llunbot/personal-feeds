You knew most of this data, but if you're taking a screenshot of your system, it looked cool and conveyed a lot of data in a small space. \"The overall purpose of Neofetch is to be used in screen-shots of your system,\" wrote Neofetch's creator, Dylan Araps, on <a href=\"https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch\">its Github repository</a>. \"Neofetch shows the information other people want to see.\"</p>\n<p>Neofetch did that, providing cool screenshots and proof-of-life images across nearly 150 OS versions until late April.
