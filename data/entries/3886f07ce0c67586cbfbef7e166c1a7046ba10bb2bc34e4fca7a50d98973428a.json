Bloomberg reviewed an OpenAI document outlining the plan, reporting that 5 gigawatts \"is roughly the equivalent of five nuclear reactors\" and warning that each data center will likely require \"more energy than is used to power an entire city or about 3 million homes.\"</p>\n<p>According to OpenAI, the US needs these massive data centers to expand AI capabilities domestically, protect national security, and effectively compete with China. If approved, the data centers would generate \"thousands of new jobs,\" OpenAI's document promised, and help cement the US as an AI leader globally.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052285#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052285&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3886f07ce0c67586cbfbef7e166c1a7046ba10bb2bc34e4fca7a50d98973428a","category":"Tech"}
