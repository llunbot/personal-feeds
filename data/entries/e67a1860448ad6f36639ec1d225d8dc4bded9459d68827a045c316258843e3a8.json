The most notable, though, is the addition of DirectX 12 support under macOS via VKD3D and MoltenVK. This marks the first time most Mac users have had access to software that relies on DirectX 12; previously, only DirectX 11 was supported, and that went for other software solutions like Parallels, too.</p>\n<p>This new release adds \"initial support\" for geometry shaders and transforms feedback on macOS Ventura. Codeweavers claims that will address a lot of problems with \"missing graphics or black screens in-game\" in titles like <em>MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries</em>, <em>Street Fighter V</em>, <em>Tekken 7</em>, and <em>Octopath Traveler</em>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961372#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961372&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e67a1860448ad6f36639ec1d225d8dc4bded9459d68827a045c316258843e3a8","category":"Tech"}
