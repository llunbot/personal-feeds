This one – maybe more than most – seems to combine all of the latest features we’ve seen in aerodynamic time trial helmets. A wide bell-shaped frontal profile with an open lower half. A sculpted side profile to hug the rider’s shoulders. More (<em>huge for TT</em>) open ventilation. Plus of course, a full wrap-around integrated visor held in place with magnets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But will that make it faster than the rest?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Limar Alien wide aerodynamic time trial helmet</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_Astana-Qazaqstan-teaser.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_Astana-Qazaqstan-teaser-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Limar Alien wide aerodynamic time trial helmet, Astana-Qazaqstan teaser\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_Astana-Qazaqstan-teaser-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_Astana-Qazaqstan-teaser-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_Astana-Qazaqstan-teaser-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_Astana-Qazaqstan-teaser-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_Astana-Qazaqstan-teaser-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_Astana-Qazaqstan-teaser-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_Astana-Qazaqstan-teaser.jpg 1800w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Limar)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wide aero seems to be the way current <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/is-dark-helmet-illegal-uci-reevaluates-time-trial-helmet-design-rules/\" target=\"_blank\">time trial helmets are trending</a>.

Yet, it still smoothly transitions with a sculpted tail that curves over the rider’s back. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_top-view.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_top-view-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Limar Alien wide aerodynamic time trial helmet, top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_top-view-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_top-view-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_top-view-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_top-view-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_top-view-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_top-view-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_top-view.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But from the top view, you can really see just how wide this TT helmet goes, and then how quickly it tapers back over the rider. It’s certainly a shorter tail than you used to see in old-school time trial and triathlon helmets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Designed in CFD but validated in the Silverstone wind tunnel</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_wind-tunnel-close-up.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_wind-tunnel-close-up.jpg\" alt=\"Limar Alien wide aerodynamic time trial helmet, Silvertone wind tunnel testing detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_wind-tunnel-close-up.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_wind-tunnel-close-up-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_wind-tunnel-close-up-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_wind-tunnel-close-up-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Limar explains that much of their drag-reduction development and aerodynamic testing focused on improving performance across a wider range of conditions, as opposed to straight-on in the Silverstone wind tunnel.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“In addition to examinations under ideal conditions, we extended the tests to realistic scenarios, simulating wind conditions commonly encountered in time trial road races, with wind angles varying between 5 and 10 degrees. These tests revealed that “Alien” particularly excels in these real-world conditions, exceeding expectations and delivering even better performance than the results obtained in CFD and wind tunnel tests. This confirms that “Alien” is not only optimized for ideal laboratory conditions, but is truly adapted to the dynamic challenges of road cycling, offering cyclists an unrivaled aerodynamic advantage.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_SSEhub-wind-tunnel.jpg\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_SSEhub-wind-tunnel.jpg\" alt=\"Limar Alien wide aerodynamic time trial helmet, Silvertone wind tunnel testing side view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_SSEhub-wind-tunnel.jpg 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_SSEhub-wind-tunnel-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_SSEhub-wind-tunnel-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_SSEhub-wind-tunnel-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is an aero helmet that claims to offer all the benefits of the ‘new school’ wide approach, and the ‘old school’ long and curvy approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“On the sides Alien is designed to generate an aerodynamic effect known as Outwash, also widely used in Formula One. This technique allows the air that hits the athlete to be deflected, moving it laterally relative to the figure and away from the shoulders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The central part of the upper shell, on the other hand, is designed to create and maintain laminar flow along the rider’s back, thanks to the Coanda effect. This area works synergistically with the lower shell, which uses the same principle to reduce turbulence in the area between the helmet and shoulders, and by efficiently directing air above them, it feeds the flow generated by the upper shell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The combination of these two phenomena directing airflow ensures reduced drag and optimal airflow around the cyclist’s body, improving aerodynamic performance. This reduces drag and improves aerodynamic efficiency, making “Alien” a truly innovative helmet in time trial cycling.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_Silverstone-wind-tunnel-screen-grab.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_Silverstone-wind-tunnel-screen-grab.jpg\" alt=\"Limar Alien wide aerodynamic time trial helmet, Silvertone wind tunnel testing screengrad\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_Silverstone-wind-tunnel-screen-grab.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_Silverstone-wind-tunnel-screen-grab-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_Silverstone-wind-tunnel-screen-grab-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_Silverstone-wind-tunnel-screen-grab-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, Limar claims a full 10W drag reduction over their already conventionally-aero short <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/limar-air-king-evo-tt-helmet/\" target=\"_blank\">Air King Evo</a> time trial helmet.

It uses a standard in-mold EPS foam core with a polycarbonate shell over top. It’s just that the outer shell extends far below and behind that regular EPS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside the 3 front vents connect through recessed channels to 2 top vents in the EPS core. Those link to the air scoop cut out of the tail of the Alien’s outer shell. Limar’s standard removable pads and Air Fit dial system offer plenty of adjustability. And an adjustable webbing straps and a magnetic clasp secure it in place. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_rear.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_rear-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"Limar Alien wide aerodynamic time trial helmet, rear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_rear-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_rear-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_rear-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_rear-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Limar-Alien-wide-aerodynamic-time-trial-helmet_rear.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The CE &amp; CPSC-certified Alien is offered in three sizes: S (53-56cm), M (54-58cm), L (57-61cm).
