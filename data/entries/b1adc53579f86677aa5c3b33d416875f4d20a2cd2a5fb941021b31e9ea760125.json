Apple's website <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-tv-4k/\">indicates</a> that the Snoopy and TV and Movies options are \"coming late 2024,\" and the Music and Soundscapes options will likely be available then too. We expect tvOS 18.2 to be released to the public in December, in line with the late 2024 timeframe.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt least some of the new screen saver options, including Snoopy, will require a second-generation Apple TV 4K or newer, according to Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nExisting screen saver categories on the Apple TV include Aerials and Memories, along with a Portraits option with clocks added in tvOS 18.0.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/new-apple-tv-screen-savers-coming-soon/\">Apple Preparing to Add New Screen Savers to tvOS 18.2, Including Snoopy and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-to-add-new-screen-savers-to-tvos-18-2-including-snoopy-and-more.2442058/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b1adc53579f86677aa5c3b33d416875f4d20a2cd2a5fb941021b31e9ea760125","category":"Apple"}
