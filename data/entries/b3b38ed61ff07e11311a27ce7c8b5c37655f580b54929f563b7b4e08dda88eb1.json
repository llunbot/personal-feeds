It promises more device types, improvements for working across ecosystems, and tools for managing battery backups, solar panels, and heat pumps.</p>\n<p>\"Enhanced Multi-Admin\" is the headline feature for anybody invested in Matter's original promise, one where you can buy a device and it doesn't matter if your other gear is meant for Amazon (Alexa), Google, Apple, or whatever, it should just connect and work. With 1.4, a home administrator should be able to let a device onto their network just once, and then have that device picked up by whatever controller they're using. There have technically been ways for a device to be set up on, say, Alexa and Apple Home, but the process has been buggy, involves generating \"secondary codes,\" and is kind of an unpaid junior sysadmin job.</p>\n<p>What's now available is \"Fabric Sync,\" which sounds like something that happens in a static-ridden dryer. But \"Fabrics\" is how the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) describes smart home systems, like Alexa or Google Home. In theory, with every tech company doing their best, you'd set up a smart light bulb with your iPhone, add it to your Apple Home, but still have it be able to be added to a Google Home system, Android phones included. Even better, ecosystems that don't offer controls for entire categories, like Apple and smart displays (because it doesn't make any), should still be able to pick up and control them.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/11/matter-1-4-has-some-solid-ideas-for-the-future-home-now-lets-see-the-support/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/11/matter-1-4-has-some-solid-ideas-for-the-future-home-now-lets-see-the-support/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b3b38ed61ff07e11311a27ce7c8b5c37655f580b54929f563b7b4e08dda88eb1","category":"Tech"}
