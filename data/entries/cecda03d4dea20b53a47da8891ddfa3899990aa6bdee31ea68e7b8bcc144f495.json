(photo/Orbea)\" /></p>\n<p>For the 2026 model year, Orbea is making some subtle updates to its Occam trail bike models. While the frame designs of the Occam SL and LT models are essentially unchanged, Orbea added significant head angle adjustability, options for internal or external cable routing, and several new color options. These refinements are a far cry from the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/orbea-rallon-dh-conquers-world-cup-on-new-carbon-race-bike-its-an-enduro-bike-too/\">major redesign of the Rallon enduro and downhill bike</a> that broke cover at a recent World Cup, but notable nonetheless.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the updates and new colors, the Occam SL and LT frames appear to be almost identical to the existing models, which were <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2024-orbea-occam-sl-lt-progressive-trail-bikes/\">most recently updated in 2024</a>. And that’s not a bad thing, as those bikes hit the versatile trail bike sweet spot, with the two models appealing to slightly different riding styles and terrain. For this update, Orbea wisely chose to keep things mostly the same, sticking with the same travel numbers and stock geometries. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re unfamiliar with the Occam models, here’s the quick rundown. Both the Occam SL (super light) and LT (long travel) models share the same frame but use different shock yokes to end up with different travel numbers. The SL has 140 mm of travel front and rear, with a geometry and builds geared toward efficiency. Orbea says it is “<em>lightweight and efficient, it’s made to conquer longer rides with speed and flow</em>.” The LT bumps travel to 150 mm in the rear, paired with a 160 mm fork. With a slacker geometry and beefier component specs, the LT is intended for more aggressive riders and terrain. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Occam-head-angle-adjust.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Occam-head-angle-adjust.webp\" alt=\"Exploded image of the adjustable headset in the new Orbea Occam models.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Occam-head-angle-adjust.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Occam-head-angle-adjust-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Occam-head-angle-adjust-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Occam-head-angle-adjust-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Occam-head-angle-adjust-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Occam-head-angle-adjust-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Occam-head-angle-adjust-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The adjustable head tube angle lets riders customize the geometry of the Occam SL and LT. (all photos/Orbea)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Adjustable Head Angle</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest highlight of the Occam SL and LT update is the adjustable head angle. Similar to the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/specialized-stumpjumper-15-pro-trail-bike-review/\">Specialized Stumpjumper 15</a>, the Occam frames now come with angle-adjustable headsets. With a total of 1.5 degrees of adjustment across three positions, riders can customize the bike’s geometry to their riding style, terrain, and preferences. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three settings include +.75°, 0°, and -.75°. So you can slacken the front end for riding more aggressive terrain, or steepen it up for sharper handling. The choice is yours. For the previously non-adjustable Occam SL, this means that riders will be able to slacken the head tube angle to 64.75° from its stock position of 65.5°. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the Occam LT, the head angle adjustment combines with the existing flip chip in the lower shock mount to provide even greater adjustability. That flip chip already made fairly substantial changes to the LT’s geometry with +/-.5° of head tube and seat tube angle adjustment, along with +/- 8 mm of bottom bracket height change between the high and low settings. Riders can now set up their Occam LT to have a head tube angle as slack as 63.25° or as steep as 65.25°.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OCCAM_SIC_CABLE_ROUTING.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OCCAM_SIC_CABLE_ROUTING.webp\" alt=\"stock image showing through-headset cable routing as well as the cable ports on the frame.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OCCAM_SIC_CABLE_ROUTING.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OCCAM_SIC_CABLE_ROUTING-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OCCAM_SIC_CABLE_ROUTING-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OCCAM_SIC_CABLE_ROUTING-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OCCAM_SIC_CABLE_ROUTING-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OCCAM_SIC_CABLE_ROUTING-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OCCAM_SIC_CABLE_ROUTING-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Orbea put cable ports on the frame so riders can choose through-headset routing or more traditional internal routing.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cable Routing Options</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the previous Occam models, Orbea basically forced through-headset cable routing on its consumers. While some people loved the super tidy appearance, others were strongly opposed and vocal about their distaste for this new and admittedly more complicated cable routing style. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Orbea wisely listened to riders and has provided options for through-headset routing <em>and</em> more traditional internal cable routing. The addition of cable ports on the frame gives riders the ability to choose their preferred routing style. Whether you prioritize the tidiest cockpit or easier serviceability, you can now set up your cables how you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Orbea-Occam-SL-hero.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Orbea-Occam-SL-hero.webp\" alt=\"Stock image of the Orbea Occam SL LTD\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Orbea-Occam-SL-hero.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Orbea-Occam-SL-hero-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Orbea-Occam-SL-hero-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Orbea-Occam-SL-hero-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Orbea-Occam-SL-hero-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Orbea-Occam-SL-hero-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Orbea-Occam-SL-hero-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The tricked-out Orbea Occam SL M-LTD looks speedy in Ivory White – Nickel.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fresh Colors and Builds</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Orbea also added updated designs and colors, along with the option for customization through the brand’s MyO customization program. Carbon frames now come in Ivory White – Nickel, Sunset Carbon View – Black, and Escape Green – Carbon View. Orbea’s Hydro alloy frames are available in Metallic Cinnamon – Black, Spaceship Green – Acid Gum, and Tanzanite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like their predecessors, the latest SL and LT builds vary based on their intended uses. The SL models generally get lighter components like Fox 36 SL forks, inline shocks, and faster-rolling tires. The Occam SL lineup consists of three carbon-framed builds, starting with the $4,499 M30 and topping out at the $9,999 M-LTD. Additionally, two alloy-framed builds, the H30 and H10, are more affordable entry points at $2,999 and $3,699, respectively.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Orbea-Occam-LT-hero.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Orbea-Occam-LT-hero.webp\" alt=\"Stock image of the new Orbea Occam LT M-Team\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Orbea-Occam-LT-hero.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Orbea-Occam-LT-hero-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Orbea-Occam-LT-hero-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Orbea-Occam-LT-hero-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Orbea-Occam-LT-hero-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Orbea-Occam-LT-hero-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Orbea-Occam-LT-hero-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The top-of-the-line Occam LT M-Team in Sunset Carbon View – Black.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Occam LT builds come with beefier Fox 36 forks, piggyback shocks, and meatier tires. The five model range includes three carbon-framed builds starting at $4,699 for the M30 and topping out at $8,199 for the tricked-out M-Team. Two budget-friendly alloy-framed builds, the $3,199 H30 and $3,999 H10, are approachably priced.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Orbea Occam SL and LT: Availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest Occam SL and LT models are available now.
