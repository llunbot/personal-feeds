{"title":"iOS 19 Rumored to Add Stage Manager Support to USB-C iPhones","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/ios-19-iphone-stage-manager-rumor/","date":1745520594000,"content":"A leaker known as <a href=\"https://x.com/majinbuofficial\">Majin Bu</a> today claimed that iOS 19 will enable support for at least a limited version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/stage-manager/\">Stage Manager</a> on iPhone models with a USB-C port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/ipados-16-stage-manager.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3574\" height=\"2006\" />\r<br />\nIn a <a href=\"https://majinbuofficial.com/ipados-19-and-ios-19-new-features/\">blog post</a> citing sources, the leaker said that when an iPhone with a USB-C port is connected to an external display, users will be able to take advantage of a Stage Manager-like interface with multiple apps open at once on the screen. However, he said that there might be more limitations compared to Stage Manager on iPads.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone models with a USB-C port include all iPhone 15 models and newer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhones with both Lightning and USB-C ports can already be connected to external displays, but only for basic screen mirroring.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe first developer beta of iOS 19 should be available immediately after the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/apple-wwdc-2025/\">WWDC 2025 keynote on June 9</a>, and the software update is expected to be released to the general public in September. It is unclear if Stage Manager support on USB-C iPhones would be available in the first beta, or enabled later in the iOS 19 software cycle.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSamsung offers a similar feature called DeX on its Galaxy smartphones.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMajin Bu has a mixed track record with Apple rumors, with some hits and some misses. They were one of the sources who accurately claimed that the device succeeding the iPhone SE <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/iphone-16e-name-is-likely/\">would be named the iPhone 16e</a>, but they also inaccurately claimed that the device <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/iphone-se-dynamic-island-rumor/\">would have a Dynamic Island</a> instead of a notch. They also accurately leaked the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-may-introduce-redesigned-milanese-loop/\">redesigned Milanese Loop for the Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/iphone-16-pro-color-desert-titanium/\">Desert Titanium color name for iPhone 16 Pro models</a>, several iPhone cases, and much more.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 19</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/\">Majin Bu</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/stage-manager/\">Stage Manager</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/ios-19-iphone-stage-manager-rumor/\">iOS 19 Rumored to Add Stage Manager Support to USB-C iPhones</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-19-rumored-to-add-stage-manager-support-to-usb-c-iphones.2455901/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0175014e5ae9d63866f3c04d7287d8843e70b5a0e5e4d158df91024665f154f8","category":"Apple"}
