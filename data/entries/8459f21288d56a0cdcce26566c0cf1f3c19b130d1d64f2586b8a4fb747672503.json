Still, some <em>MacRumors</em> readers who can't follow the event as it's being broadcast are interested in avoiding all of the announcements and waiting until the event has ended is available for on-demand viewing so as to experience it without already knowing the outcome.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/apple-event-september-14.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nFor those individuals, we've posted this news story, which will be updated with a direct link to the presentation once it becomes available from Apple. No other news stories or announcements will be displayed alongside this story.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's recent virtual events have been made available to view almost immediately following the conclusion of the broadcasts, and we expect similar timing for today's event.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUsers waiting for the video to be posted are welcome to gather in the thread associated with this news story, and we ask that those who follow the events as they occur refrain from making any posts about Apple's announcements in this thread.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spoiler-free/\">spoiler-free</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2021-event/\">September 2021 Apple Event</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/september-2021-spoiler-free/\">September 2021 Apple Event Spoiler-Free Video Stream</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/september-2021-apple-event-spoiler-free-video-stream.2310686/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UxicpsMkvi0:4jaeGjt6uWA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UxicpsMkvi0:4jaeGjt6uWA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/UxicpsMkvi0\" />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8459f21288d56a0cdcce26566c0cf1f3c19b130d1d64f2586b8a4fb747672503","category":"Apple"}
