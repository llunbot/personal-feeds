Starting June 4, 2025, Let's Encrypt will <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/2025/01/22/ending-expiration-emails/\">no longer notify its subscribers that their certification is about to expire</a> and needs renewal. Some hosting providers automatically obtain and manage certificates from Let's Encrypt, so there's not much for them to do. Everyone else will have to do something, and likely it will still be free and automated.</p>\n<p>Let's Encrypt is ending automated emails for four stated reasons, and all of them are pretty sensible. For one thing, lots of customers have been able to automate their certificate renewal. For another, providing the expiration notices costs \"tens of thousands of dollars per year\" and adds complexity to the nonprofit's infrastructure as they are looking to add new and more useful services.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/lets-encrypt-is-ending-expiration-notice-emails-for-some-very-good-reasons/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/lets-encrypt-is-ending-expiration-notice-emails-for-some-very-good-reasons/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6b143159ae00bd9aa6e22554c69538c9ccc88f8195ab130989f0a3d357ef400f","category":"Tech"}
