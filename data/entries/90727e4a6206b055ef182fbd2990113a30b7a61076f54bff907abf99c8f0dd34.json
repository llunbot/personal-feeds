Less than 10 years ago, a seatpost that moved up and down was a rarity, but it’s near impossible to find a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-how-to-choose-the-right-one-for-you/\">mountain bike</a> without one now.</p>\n<p>A dropper post is a must-have these days if you’re riding anything remotely technical, opening up a far wider range of riding – without having to stop and manually move your post up and down when tackling steep trails.</p>\n<p>We’ve got a wide range of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/seatposts/\">dropper post reviews</a> on BikeRadar and this list represents the best of the best. Whether you’re looking to fit a dropper post to your bike for the first time or upgrade your current dropper, you’ll find something here.</p>\n<p>For more information on what to look out for when

fitment.</p>\n<p>The post’s construction screams quality and it was very simple to fit to our test bikes thanks to the cable’s nipple attaching to the post end with the lever clamping the cable at the other end.</p>\n<p>The stack height — the distance from the bottom of the post’s collar to the centre of the seat rails — was impressively short at 50mm, too.</p>\n<p>Although the remote was £55 extra, we thought it was well worth it, thanks to its smooth action and adjustable angle.</p>\n<p>Previously, Crankbrothers’ posts had a reputation for being unreliable, but we had no such experiences with the Highline 7, and should the worst happen, it’s backed by the brand’s four-year warranty.</p>\n<p>Top-quality Trelleborg sealing and igus glide bearings mean performance is impressively smooth, easily controlled and consistent even on the longest, dirtiest rides or after an extended rest, although the return speed isn’t adjustable a ‘soft push’ of the lever does make the seat post return slower.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/seatposts/crankbrothers-highline-7-dropper-post-review/\">Read our full Crankbrothers Highline 7 dropper post

the same position at full extension, without the equivalent increase in post stack height.</p>\n<p>OneUp’s done this by making the post’s body, seal head and seat clamp as slim as possible and the 210mm travel post was shorter than RockShox’ Reverb B1 150mm travel post by 34mm. It’s impressive stuff.</p>\n<p>To boot, the V2 doesn’t cost a fortune and we had no issues with it sticking or feeling lumpy during the testing period. It also made us wonder why we haven’t upgraded to a longer travel, shorter stack post sooner!</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/seatposts/oneup-v2-dropper-post-with-oneup-dropper-post-remote-v2-review/\">Read our full OneUp V2 dropper post review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>BikeYoke Revive 2.0</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The BikeYoke Revive 2.0 dropper seatpost is seriously long at 213mm.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: £299-£365 as tested (without dropper lever)</li>\n<li><strong>Weight</strong>: 642g</li>\n<li><strong>Stroke length (* tested)</strong>: 125mm, 160mm, 185mm, 213mm*</li>\n<li><strong>Diameters (* tested)</strong>: 30.9mm, 31.6mm*, 34.9mm (Revive Max)</li>\n<li><strong>Max length</strong>: 397mm (125mm travel), 467mm (160mm travel), 517mm (185mm travel), 582mm (213mm travel)</li>\n</ul><p>As far as we are aware, the BikeYoke Revive 2.0 is the longest dropper post on the market with 213mm of travel and a 582mm max length in its biggest size, which is good news for those with long legs.</p>\n<p>The low stack height keeps the post out of the way when it’s down, providing plenty of room to move your body around when descending.</p>\n<p>The BikeYoke Revive 2.0 has always been praised for its smooth action, and our testing led us to think that this could well be the best feeling cable-operated dropper around, with a precise and light lever feel.</p>\n<p>The BikeYoke Revive 2.0 doesn’t come with a dropper lever included, and this will cost an extra £65 on top of the initial £299–£365 outlay (depending on stroke length).</p>\n<p>Finally, the post doesn’t use an IFP (internal floating piston) like some other brands. This means fewer seals, less friction and less to go wrong, but it does mean the oil can mix with the air resulting in sponginess. A 4mm bolt underneath the saddle clamp makes it easy to refresh the post, but the necessity of this could be offputting for some.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/seatposts/bikeyoke-revive-2-review/\">Read our full BikeYoke Revive 2.0 dropper post review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Bontrager Line Elite</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Bontrager Line Elite comes with a dropper lever included.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: £300 / $330 / AU$440/ €350 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Weight</strong>: 558g</li>\n<li><strong>Stroke length (* tested)</strong>: 100mm, 130mm, 150mm, 170mm*</li>\n<li><strong>Diameters (* tested)</strong>: 30.9mm, 31.6mm*, 34.9mm</li>\n<li><strong>Max length</strong>: 340mm (100mm travel), 400mm (130mm travel), 440mm (150mm travel), 480mm (170mm travel)</li>\n</ul><p>The Bontrager Line Elite is the higher-specced of two dropper seat posts from the brand, with the lower being the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/seatposts/seatpost-and-seat-pin/bontrager-drop-line-dropper-seatpost-review/\">Bontrager Drop Line</a>.</p>\n<p>This model has Bontrager’s MaxFlow cartridge, which makes for faster and smoother action.</p>\n<p>The price includes a dropper lever, which works with Shimano I-spec and SRAM Matchmaker levers, but we found the lever to feel spongy when using it in testing.</p>\n<p>This dropper post has a greater stack height than others at 62mm, providing less clearance when the post is dropped.</p>\n<p>A nice touch is the adjustable travel height.

Every Transfer we’ve used has stayed that way indefinitely, no matter how bad the conditions or minimal the maintenance.</p>\n<p>That makes the high price a reasonable investment, and the Performance version skips the gold Kashima coating of the Factory post to save £50.

KS’s shifter-style ‘Southpaw’ lever (£37 alloy, £59 carbon) is much nicer to use than the short ‘universal’ knuckle lever that comes as standard.</p>\n<p>The way that the post extends if you pick the bike up by the saddle is a pet hate of some people. We do still occasionally get LEVs that need a nudge or pull to extend them too, but that’s less common than it used to be.</p>\n<p>Our main criticism of the LEV is how the cable is mounted – it’s clamped at the post end instead of the lever. This means accurate cable tension and length is needed to get it working well and it takes longer to set up than posts where the cable is clamped at the remote end.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/seatposts/ks-lev-integra-dropper-post-review-2/\">Read the full KS LEV Integra dropper post review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals for the KS LEV Integra</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>PNW Loam</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> PNW’s Loam dropper post builds on an already extensive component range that offers good value across the board.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: £146 / $199 / €170 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Weight</strong>: 524g</li>\n<li><strong>Stroke length (* tested)</strong>: 125mm, 150mm*, 170mm, 200mm</li>\n<li><strong>Diameters (* tested)</strong>: 30.9mm, 31.6mm*, 34.9mm</li>\n<li><strong>Max length</strong>: 385mm (125mm travel), 440mm (150mm travel), 480mm (170mm travel), 540mm (200mm travel)</li>\n</ul><p>PNW offers good value for money across its range of products and its Loam dropper post is no exception.</p>\n<p>The dropper post performed well through testing and the Loam lever (which is sold separately for £50 / $69 / €59) has a positive and predictable feel.</p>\n<p>The Loam dropper comes with some nifty features including customisable speed return and easy on-bike travel adjustment.</p>\n<p>The 55mm stack height is reasonable and still leaves a decent amount of room to move around when the saddle is dropped.</p>\n<p>There is noticeable side play when wiggling the saddle which made the post feel less sturdy but did nothing to impact performance.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/seatposts/pnw-loam-dropper-post-review/\">Read our full PNW Loam dropper post review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Syncros Duncan Dropper 2.0</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The smooth black finish felt robust and it’s yet to have a mark on it even a month or two down the line.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: £210 / $230 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Weight</strong>: 562g</li>\n<li><strong>Stroke length (* tested)</strong>: 125mm, 150mm*</li>\n<li><strong>Diameters</strong>: 31.6mm</li>\n<li><strong>Max length</strong>: 458mm</li>\n</ul><p>Because the Duncan Dropper 2.0 comes in solely one diameter (31.6mm), it’s only possible to fit it to bikes with a 31.6mm or larger (by adding a shim) diameter seatpost.

Dropping your saddle down gives you much more space to get behind the seat on steep downhill sections, moving your weight back on the bike.</p>\n<p>Dropper posts aren’t just for getting rad on the descents; a tap of the remote lever pops your saddle back up to the correct height for efficient pedalling, all without having to stop.</p>\n<p>Having the ability to gain standover height is beneficial for nearly every type of mountain biking. In fact, even <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cyclocross-bikes/\">cyclocross</a> riders are embracing the added control, where being able to quickly switch from grinding uphill to attacking a descent is essential.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>How much travel do I need?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Longer travel dropper posts are now more common.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Travel refers to how much the posts slides up and down, and it dictates just how far out of the way you’ll be able to get your saddle while still having the best position for pedalling.</p>\n<p>Less expensive posts often have less travel. The longer the travel, the stronger and more precise the internal mechanisms have to be.</p>\n<p>100mm is the starting point for most dropper posts. That amount of drop makes a noticeable difference, but we’ve found that longer travel posts do a much better job of maximising the clearance while maintaining a proper seated pedalling height.</p>\n<p>The typical amount of drop is around 125mm to 170mm of travel, which works well for most riders.</p>\n<p>Longer travel posts do exist, from 170mm up to 210mm, but they can be difficult to use for shorter riders or on certain bike frames. That said, longer travel posts are becoming more and more common as technology improves and bike manufacturers design frames with shorter seat tubes.</p>\n<p>To figure out how long of a drop you can use, measure your existing seatpost from the saddle rail to the top of seat collar, then compare this to the length of the dropper post from saddle rail to below the post’s collar.</p>\n<p>If the number is the same or less, you’re in business. If the dropper post’s length is longer, you’ll have to use another option.</p>\n<h3>Fixed or infinite travel adjustment?</h3>\n<p>There are two travel styles for dropper posts: those that have fixed height settings where the post stops (20mm down, 75mm down, etc.), and those that do not, often referred to as stepless or infinitely adjustable.</p>\n<p>Stepless posts let you stop the saddle anywhere within the post’s travel range. The majority of posts on the market are stepless designs.</p>\n<h3>Dropper seatpost internal workings</h3>\n<p>All posts require some sort of spring to return the saddle to the fully upright position and a locking mechanism to hold it in place.</p>\n<p>Early designs simply used coil springs and pins to do the job, but these were less refined and often returned the saddle back towards your bottom at an unnerving speed.</p>\n<p>You can still find mechanically locking designs with an air spring, but most dropper posts now use a fully sealed hydraulic cartridge that contains both a pressurised charge and a mechanism that allows the adjustment.</p>\n<p>There are a number of advantages to this, namely that the body of the post, which needs to cope with very heavy loads, doesn’t also have to be airtight and so lower friction seals can be used for a lighter action.</p>\n<p>If something does go wrong with the post, then it’s also much quicker and easier to switch in a replacement cartridge rather than repairing the entire post.</p>\n<h3>Dropper seatpost remotes</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Most dropper post remotes are sited on the handlebar.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans</i></span></div>\n<p>On most droppers, lowering the saddle is done by a handlebar-mounted remote.</p>\n<p>The remote lever commonly sits under the bar, taking the place of the front shifter paddles on bikes equipped with a single-ring drivetrain. On bikes with a front shifter, remotes that integrate into the lock-on grip collar or sit above the bar are available.</p>\n<p>SRAM’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/sram-matchmaker-x/\">Matchmaker</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/shimano-i-spec-a-b-and-ii-mounts-explained/\">Shimano’s I-Spec</a> standards allow you to combine a dropper and brake lever on one mount to keep the handlebar tidy.</p>\n<p>On bargain-priced dropper posts, the lever may be just under the saddle on the post’s head. The obvious downside to this style is having to take a hand off the bar, something you don’t want to do when riding into a section worthy of dropping the saddle.</p>\n<p>Most remotes on the market use a cable to operate them but some, such as the RockShox Reverb, use a hydraulic system.</p>\n<p>There are drawbacks and benefits to each. Cables are cheap and easy to replace if they fail, but over time they become stiffer to use as dirt enters them.</p>\n<p>That isn’t a problem for hydraulic units, but they are much harder to fix should you damage one in the field.</p>\n<h3>Cable routing</h3>\n<p>The overwhelming majority of dropper post cables are internally routed. This requires a hole in the frame to route the cable up through the seat tube – virtually every modern mountain bike, and the latest gravel bikes, have this option.</p>\n<p>The other cable option is an external cable that either attaches at the dropper post’s collar or up at the head where the saddle attaches.</p>\n<p>Benefits of an internally routed cable include clean looks, better protection from dirt and debris, and zero cable movement when dropping the post. But, like any internally routed cable, set up can be tricky, and swapping cables and housing can be a chore.</p>\n<p>The upsides to an externally routed cable are compatibility with any frame and a simpler setup. The negatives deal primarily with cables that attach to the seatpost head, because the cable can interfere with the bike’s rear tyre or hit your leg if not carefully routed.</p>\n<p>The final option does away with the cable completely – the RockShox Reverb AXS is an example of a dropper post that uses a wireless, electronic system. Removing the mechanical cable from the equation makes installation super easy and also makes swapping the seatpost from bike to bike a reality, provided they share the same seatpost diameter.</p>","author":"Alex Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"90727e4a6206b055ef182fbd2990113a30b7a61076f54bff907abf99c8f0dd34","category":"Cycling"}
