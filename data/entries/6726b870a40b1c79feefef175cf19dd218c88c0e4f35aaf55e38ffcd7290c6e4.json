Instead, the 4060 is a machine built for riders who want a progressive bike that is fun to ride on the trails.</p>\n<p>This approach has gone some way to define the shape of the 4060, which follows recent trends for progressive <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-bike-geometry-and-handling/\">mountain bike geometry</a>.</p>\n<p>The bike has 433mm chainstays in a size medium, which is said to give the bike a snappy and playful feel. The reach is kept long and progressive but not too extreme at 459mm in a size medium, and the slack 63.8-degree head angle is said to give stability and confidence on descents.</p>\n<h2>SCOR 4060 geometry charts and sizing</h2>\n<p>The 4060 is available in four sizes and SCOR has specified the different sizes by their reach. All the bikes have short seat tubes so SCOR says you can run a long <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\" target=\"_blank\">dropper post</a> if need

has packed with a host of details, but the rear suspension layout is the star attraction.</p>\n<h3>Lower link-activated suspension and adjustability</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The SCOR 4060 has a lower link-activated suspension system.</span></figcaption><span> <i>SCOR</i></span></div>\n<p>The SCOR 4060 has a lower link-activated shock system that places the centre of gravity on the bike very low.</p>\n<p>Compatible with either air or coil shocks, SCOR says the system strikes the right balance between being supple without bottoming out harshly.</p>\n<p>In the press event for the 4060, SCOR highlighted how this two-link system differs from the BMC’s two-link APS suspension system.</p>\n<p>Both systems have two links that rotate in the same direction but SCOR says the centre of rotation on the 4060 is comparatively lower, which helps to drop the anti-squat and reduce anti-rise.</p>\n<p>SCOR wanted the 4060 to climb well and the two-link design is said to keep things stiff and provide grip, but the anti-squat drops off when you go deeper into the travel.</p>\n<p>SCOR has incorporated a flip-chip into the rear suspension system. This is used to switch between the bike’s short and long travel setups. The flip-chip is said to change the height of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">bottom bracket</a> without affecting the kinematics of the bike.</p>\n<p>The 4060 also has an adjustable <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-headsets/\">headset</a>, which allows you to switch from 63.8 to 65 degrees on the long travel frame and from 64.5 to 65.5 degrees on the short travel frame. With this, SCOR claims “you basically have two bikes in one.”</p>\n<h3>The details</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The stash box comes with a spare derailleur hanger.</span></figcaption><span> <i>SCOR</i></span></div>\n<p>Elsewhere on the 4060, practicality is met with neat touches.</p>\n<p>The bike has space for two water bottles, with one set of bosses on the down tube and one on the underside of the top tube.</p>\n<p>There is also a built-in stash box on the underside of the downtube to store anything you want to take to take with you on a ride.</p>\n<p><span>SCOR has opted for a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-universal-derailleur-hanger/\">SRAM universal derailleur hanger</a> across the non-assisted 4060 range and all the bikes come with a spare <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/a-complete-guide-to-rear-derailleurs/\">rear derailleur</a> hanger tucked away in the stash box.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There is a huck plate on the seat tube to protect the frame.</span></figcaption><span> <i>SCOR</i></span></div>\n<p>On the rear face of the seat tube, SCOR has added a ‘huck plate’ to help protect the frame if you fit tyres that are too big, which could consequently hit the tube if you bottom out. SCOR also says it will replace this plate if you do damage it while when riding.</p>\n<p>SCOR wanted to create a bike that had no graphics on the frame, and this backplate is where model type info and branding is subtly shown off.</p>\n<p>The lack of graphics helps SCOR achieve the 4060’s boutique feel, but this opens up the possibility for customisation too. Each bike is provided with stick-on frame protectors that let riders customise the look of their bike with different graphics.</p>\n<p>You will also be able to design and order your own stick-on frame protectors.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The chainstay protector mimics the profile of the Chaumont jump line.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>One other fun detail on the frame is the chainstay protector. Its profile matches the massive double jumps on the Chaumont jump line in the Jura region – a bike park bike, indeed.</p>\n<p>SCOR says the 4060 has an approximate weight of 14kg and has a rider weight limit of 125kg.</p>\n<h2>Electric SCOR 4060 Z</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 4060 Z is the electric version of the bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>SCOR</i></span></div>\n<p>SCOR has also today released an ebike version of the 4060 called the 4060 Z.</p>\n<p>Like the standard 4060, the assisted version will be available in short and long travel options. SCOR says it has aimed to create an electric bike with “no compromise geometry”.</p>\n<p>SCOR has managed to incorporate the motor into the bike without disrupting the design of the rear suspension, and SCOR says it retains the same kinematics across both the electric and standard bikes.</p>\n<p>The rear chainstays on the 4060 Z are only 2mm longer than the non-assisted version of the bike. SCOR says this was quite a challenge given the extra bulk an assisted drivetrain adds to a bike, but also says this helps the electric version retain the 4060’s playful feel.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> SCOR opted for the Shimano EP8 motor for its electric bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>SCOR</i></span></div>\n<p>SCOR has opted for a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-du-ep800-motor/\">Shimano EP8 motor</a> across its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">electric bikes</a> as it found this to be the lightest motor for its power.</p>\n<p>SCOR also says it opted for a light motor as this meant it could equip the bike with a heavier Darfon 720Wh battery, improving the range of the bike.</p>\n<p>While SCOR has tried to keep much the same between the assisted and non-assisted bikes, the addition of a motor has meant it has had to forgo the stash-box on the 4060 Z.</p>\n<p>Also, while the non-assisted bikes come with SRAM components, the assisted bikes all come with Shimano <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/mountain-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\">mountain bike groupsets</a>.</p>\n<h2>Where can I buy SCOR bikes?</h2>\n<p>SCOR bikes will initially be available as complete bikes only through select retailers and a click and collect service.</p>\n<p>At first, SCOR will focus only on what it describes as the “Alpine Arc”, which includes Switzerland, Germany, Austria and Italy It will also distribute the bikes in the USA and Canada. There will be roughly 60 SCOR retailers in the Alpine Arc and roughly 25 in the USA and Canada.</p>\n<p>When we asked whether the bikes will be available through retailers in the UK, SCOR simply said “not yet”, and emphasised that the brand wants to have a smaller regional focus before rolling distribution out further.</p>\n<p>SCOR will also offer a direct-to-consumer model that will include framesets, accessories, spare parts and merchandise, but not complete bikes.</p>\n<h2>SCOR 4060 range and prices</h2>\n<p>The SCOR 4060 range includes long travel and short travel bikes with either a top-shelf spec or an entry-level spec across assisted and non-assisted bikes.</p>\n<p>Prices start from $4,499 / €4,299 / CHF 4,599.</p>\n<h3>SCOR 4060 LT GX</h3>\n<div>\n    <img
