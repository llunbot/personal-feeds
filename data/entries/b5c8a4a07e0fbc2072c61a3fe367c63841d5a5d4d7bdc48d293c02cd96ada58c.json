How long could bulky office scanners keep justifying the space they take up? Unfortunately, their time has come because <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/iscanner-app-lifetime-subscription?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=iscanner-app-lifetime-subscription&amp;utm_term=scsf-610039&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002gShuIAE&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">iScanner</a> does everything a scanner can and more, and it takes up exactly as much room as your iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it’s an iOS app. It’s also on sale for $27.99 (reg. $199). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>iScanner actually works for iPhones AND iPads, so put that one in your pocket. It uses the cameras on your device to scan virtually any document type, and the OCR tech recognizes the text in 20 different languages. That means you can turn a hard-copy page into a searchable document in a couple seconds. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This scanner app also has some cool little bonus features. Point it at a bunch of the same objects (think jelly beans, paper clips, etc) and it’ll count them. If you’re checking out a new apartment, you can even use iScanner to measure the room. No more wondering where your furniture’s gonna fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s see your office scanner do that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use code FESTIVE30 by January 12 at 11:59 p.m. PT to get a <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/iscanner-app-lifetime-subscription?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=iscanner-app-lifetime-subscription&amp;utm_term=scsf-610039&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002gShuIAE&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">lifetime subscription to iScanner</a> for $27.99. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/iscanner-app-lifetime-subscription?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=iscanner-app-lifetime-subscription&amp;utm_term=scsf-610039&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002gShuIAE&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp1.stackassets.com/49bbc2d3be0a43fd04537f5a198f3b5c920af726/store/c8771d986c57cffd8f4d4db680d8eeef1bc7513707f3374ab9b579fb5159/sale_297719_primary_image.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iScanner App: Lifetime Subscription – $27.99</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/iscanner-app-lifetime-subscription?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=iscanner-app-lifetime-subscription&amp;utm_term=scsf-610039&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002gShuIAE&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com\" target=\"_blank\">StackSocial</a> prices subject to change. </em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b5c8a4a07e0fbc2072c61a3fe367c63841d5a5d4d7bdc48d293c02cd96ada58c","category":"Apple"}
