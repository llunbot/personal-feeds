But the White House still sees a future for burning hydrocarbons, as the executive order will also develop new long-term fuel-efficiency standards, and there is no mention of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/electric-cars-have-much-lower-life-cycle-emissions-new-study-confirms/\">phasing out internal combustion engines for new vehicles</a> at any point in the future.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are expected to announce new fuel-efficiency rules through model year 2026.

The plan would reduce emissions from new vehicles by 17 percent by MY2026.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785221#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785221&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
