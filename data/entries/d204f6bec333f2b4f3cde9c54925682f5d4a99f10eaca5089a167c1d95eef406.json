The practice is a clear violation of manufacturing standards and could lead to harmful cross-contamination, the FDA said.</p>\n<p>The agency sent <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/brenntag-great-lakes-llc-660268-10262023\">a warning letter</a> dated October 26 to the maker of the hand sanitizer, Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC, in Wisconsin. The letter, which redacted the name of the hand sanitizer, stated that the agency had found \"significant violations\" in an inspection in the spring and that the company's responses since then were \"inadequate.\"</p>\n<p>Toxic hand sanitizers became an alarming problem in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand for the germ-fighting gels skyrocketed and manufacturers rushed products to market. <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitizers-consumers-should-not-use\">Hundreds of products</a> that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/07/mounting-poisonings-blindness-deaths-as-toxic-hand-sanitizers-flood-market/\">flooded the market</a> were found to contain methanol, a toxic alcohol that can cause harm via inhalation, ingestion, and skin absorption.
