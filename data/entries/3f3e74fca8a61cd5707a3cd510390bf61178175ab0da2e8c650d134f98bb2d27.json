The haul amounted to $31 million worth of tokens on the Ethereum or Polygon blockchains, both of which are supported by the MonoX protocol.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817374#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817374&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3f3e74fca8a61cd5707a3cd510390bf61178175ab0da2e8c650d134f98bb2d27","category":"Tech"}
