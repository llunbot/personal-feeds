Pangrams, of course, are\nsentences that contain each letter of the alphabet at least once,\nof which <em>the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</em> is surely\nthe most famous. Lettering artists of the previous generation\nbequeathed us <em>jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz;</em> puzzlers\nare fond of the impossibly compact <em>Mr Jock, TV quiz PhD, bags few\nlynx</em> for its 26-letter world record. Sometime in the early\nnineties, I whiled away an entire afternoon in a San Francisco\ncafé coming up with a bunch of my own, honoring typeface designers\n<em>(mix Zapf with Veljović and get quirky Béziers),</em> and\nphilosophers <em>(you go tell that vapid existentialist quack Freddy\nNietzsche that he can just bite me, twice),</em> and the uplifting\ngrace of a cosmos in balance <em>(Wham! Volcano erupts fiery liquid\ndeath onto ex-jazzbo Kenny G.)</em> Pangrams are unctuous little brain\nticklers, challenging to concoct, droll to read, and immensely\npopular for presenting fonts.</p>\n\n<p>I find them singularly useless in type design, and I don’t use\nthem in my work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/30/hoeflers-proof\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1ff4ac69c6d33e8d72436550fc27f0b7ce121e86dcd6cef79d2e3b02c4811e92","category":"Tech"}
