Pogačar won the two ‘mountain’ stages on Jebel Jais and Jebel Hafeet at the UAE Tour on the way to overall victory, while Vingegaard was similarly victorious at the first stage race he entered this year, the Volta ao Algarve. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being sixth on GC after Stage 4, the Dane won the final stage individual time-trial by 11 seconds ahead of teammate Wout van Aert to leapfrog Pogačar’s teammate João Almeida (among others) in the standings.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a

having won all the sprint stages at the UAE Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Stage 1 to Dubai she edged out compatriots Charlotte Kool and Nienke Veenhoven of Picnic-PostNL and Visma-Lease a Bike respectively, while on Stage 2 to Al Mirfa she beat Human Powered Health’s Lily Williams and UAE Team ADQ’s Irish rider Lara Gillespie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the final day around Abu Dhabi, Wiebes saw off Sara Fiorin from Ceratizit Pro Cycling and Cofidis’s Amalie Dideriksen for a third win, which unsurprisingly secured the overall points jersey too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UAE Tour Women’s general classification winner has always been the winner on Stage 3’s Jabel Hafeet climb, and so it was again, with Elisa Longo Borghini winning big for her new UAE Team ADQ squad. Her gap was large enough that none of her nearest challengers overall finished within two minutes of her, the closest being teammate Silvia Persico, who was second, 2min 06sec down.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tom Pidcock</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"646\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2200841799-646x970.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2200841799-646x970.jpg 646w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2200841799-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2200841799-768x1153.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2200841799-1023x1536.jpg 1023w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2200841799-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2200841799-750x1126.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2200841799-1140x1711.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2200841799-scaled.jpg 1706w\" /><figcaption>Szymon Gruchalski/Getty Images</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It continues to be a prosperous move to Q36.5 Pro Cycling for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tom-pidcock-profile\">Tom Pidcock</a>, who clinched his third stage win of the year on a hilly Stage 2 at the Vuelta a Andalucía.

Ganna is the biggest ‘loser’ in the fallout of the dramatic end to Stage 1 of the Volta ao Algarve, having been initially awarded the win only for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-news-2025-uae-tour\">the stage to then be cancelled</a> and the results scrapped. But the real culprits were the race organisers, who have since accepted the blame for the chaos that marred the final moments of the stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After 189km of racing, the peloton steamed into the final kilometre of the day in Lagos. As the commissaire’s lead car pulled off at the roundabout to get out of the way of the impending sprint finish, almost the entirety of the field followed, which put them on the wrong side of a barrier lined with spectators as the race headed for the line. As a result, two sprints launched simultaneously on either side, with Ganna finding himself well clear of the small number of riders that hadn’t gone astray at the roundabout. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a tough call for the win to be taken off Ganna, who was ultimately punished despite doing everything right. He said after the stage, ‘I know everyone went the wrong way, but I took the right corner. You need to know the <em>parcours</em>, you need to know the rules as riders.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding salt into the wound, a statement from the Volta ao Algarve included a comment from race director Sérgio Sousa about how the stage was cancelled as ‘the sporting truth did not prevail in the end’, though they did accept their responsibility for not doing enough ‘to avoid the outcome’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visma-Lease a Bike’s sports director Arthur van Dongen described the incident as ‘unacceptable’, while Tudor Pro Cycling’s Marco Haller said it was ‘pretty ridiculous’.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Egan Bernal</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"646\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2200154395-646x970.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2200154395-646x970.jpg 646w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2200154395-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2200154395.jpg 682w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It was a wild few days for Ineos Grenadiers, who experienced the highs of victories and the crushing blows of both a nullified win and another injury for Egan Bernal.
