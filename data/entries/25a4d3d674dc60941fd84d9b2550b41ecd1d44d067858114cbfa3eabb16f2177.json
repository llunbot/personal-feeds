Four-digit passcodes or PINs were the only way to secure the earliest iPhone models. Today, 16 years after the iPhone’s debut, we have progressed to a six-digit standard passcode accompanied by fingerprint or face recognition biometrics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider that a four- or six-digit numerical PIN facilitates up to one million possible combinations. That’s not much in an era of speedy hacking tools–or compared with a potential 50 million possible letter-number-special character combos available from the iPhone’s built-in keyboard. Face ID is great, but you can aways skip it, and it’s been well-documented that thieves are spying on people who type in their passcode and snatching their phones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there’s a feature that’s been available as far back as iOS 10 I was unaware of until recently. You don’t have so settle for a passcode—you can create a lengthy alphanumeric password or passphrase for your iPhone that will vastly improve the privacy of your personal information. This code is no mere PIN, but a genuine password complete with upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Passcode-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iOS 16 change passcode\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Passcode-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2100w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Passcode-1.jpg?resize=300%2C211&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Passcode-1.jpg?resize=768%2C539&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Passcode-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C843&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Passcode-1.jpg?resize=1536%2C1079&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Passcode-1.jpg?resize=2048%2C1438&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"843\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting up an iPhone password is as easy as changing your PIN. Via the Settings app, choose <em>Face ID &amp; Passcode</em> for most newer iPhones or <em>Touch ID &amp; Passcode</em> for iPhones with a Home button and enter your current PIN. Scroll down until you see the <em>Change Passcode</em> option, where you must enter your passcode again. Then, you’ll see a button labeled <em>Passcode Options</em>. Tap that and several choices emerge. The one you want to use is <em>Custom Alphanumeric Code</em>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Passcode2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iOS 16 passcode options\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Passcode2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2100w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Passcode2.jpg?resize=300%2C211&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Passcode2.jpg?resize=768%2C539&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Passcode2.jpg?resize=1200%2C843&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Passcode2.jpg?resize=1536%2C1079&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Passcode2.jpg?resize=2048%2C1438&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"843\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This feature lets you create a new password with up to 34 characters. There are some downsides to going this route. For example, you will no longer tap that easy keypad to unlock your phone; rather you’ll need to use the standard cramped iPhone keyboard. You’ll need to tap <em>Done</em> or <em>OK</em> each time you use it. And it will be yet another password you must remember. But there’s a big upside: With the right code, your phone will be virtually impenetrable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You won’t always have to strike such stark security versus ease-of-use balance. If you’re using an alphanumeric passcode alongside your phone’s biometric security you won’t need to enter a long password each time you unlock your phone. You’ll need it only when you shut down or restart your handset, or when Face ID or Toch ID doesn’t work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pro tip: You can also use the Custom Numeric Code option to set a long all-number code. This may be a bit less secure but more convenient. Plus, you still get the use the easy numerical keypad.<br /></p>\n\niOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"25a4d3d674dc60941fd84d9b2550b41ecd1d44d067858114cbfa3eabb16f2177","category":"Apple"}
