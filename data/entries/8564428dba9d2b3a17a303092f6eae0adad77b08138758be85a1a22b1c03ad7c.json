The source is a fight that all of us must fight with voting and legislation. My fight is on the streets of our city. I accept that the nails and screws exist, and when the bureaucracy fails us, and breaks our spirits, we mistakenly believe that nothing else can be done to fight it</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This is wrong. We are better than this. We can lift these nails and screws from our streets and prevent them from taking that thing which we hold most dear, our time, our money, and our precious tires. Join me and we can fight this fight together. This should not be my fight alone, I believe that every city in America or the entire world can have magnet men and magnet women and or magnet persons to help fight this fight together, for all of humanity</em>.” </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Not Just Magnets</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Atlanta-Magnet-Man-the-future.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Atlanta-Magnet-Man-the-future.jpeg\" alt=\"Atlanta Magnet Man the future\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Atlanta-Magnet-Man-the-future.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Atlanta-Magnet-Man-the-future-297x167.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Atlanta-Magnet-Man-the-future-120x68.jpeg 120w\" /></a><figcaption>Alex is planning to purchase a prototype <a href=\"https://bikelanesweeper.com\">Bike Lane Sweeper</a> with funds raised from the GoFundMe campagin.
