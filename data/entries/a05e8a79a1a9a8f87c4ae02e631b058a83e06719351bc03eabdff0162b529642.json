But Apple isn’t content with just letting the season end and leaving us waiting for a third season. Apple seemingly wants to prolong its time in the spotlight by releasing a Behind the Scenes–err, I mean, Behind the <em>Mac</em> video about the production of the show, specifically, editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple really wants you to see this video, so much so that they’re promoting it in the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/mac/lumon-terminal-pro/\">Mac section of Apple.com</a>. Click on that link, and you’ll see a “New” Lumon Terminal Pro, the computers that sit on the desks of the Lumon offices in the show. Below the computer is a blue button that opens the video. The Lumon Terminal Pro is also listed alongside the MacBook Air as a “New” Mac but sadly, you can’t preorder one.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 12-minute video offers interesting insights into the editing process for “83 terabytes of footage” and how particular screens were handled for the show—the whole video is a spoiler for season two if you haven’t watched it yet. The editors worked on the Mac mini, iMac, and MacBook Pro, but they did not use Apple’s Final Cut Pro or Logic; they used Avid software, which is considered the standard in Hollywood production. The <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/mac/lumon-terminal-pro/\">video is on Apple’s website</a> and YouTube above.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a05e8a79a1a9a8f87c4ae02e631b058a83e06719351bc03eabdff0162b529642","category":"Apple"}
