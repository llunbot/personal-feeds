BMW was the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/03/bmw-i4-integrated-carplay-instrument-cluster/\">first automaker to include the extended CarPlay feature</a> in its Polestar 2 rival, the BMW i4, in 2021.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome vehicles with Apple ‌CarPlay‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/review/2021-volkswagen-id-4-carplay/\">already feature</a> limited turn-by-turn directional information fed from ‌Apple Maps‌ on the driver's display, but full integration of ‌Apple Maps‌ into the instrument cluster is still very uncommon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe P2.9 over-the-air update also brings additional phone and media information from Apple ‌CarPlay‌ to to the Polestar 2's home screen tile, support for managing phone calls in Apple ‌CarPlay‌ using the steering wheel buttons, and projection of calls in the driver display. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, the update includes improvements to Polestar's Range Assistant app and the introduction of an integrated YouTube app. The new ‌CarPlay‌ experience and the YouTube app will be installed by default on all newly produced cars.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple ‌CarPlay‌ in the Polestar 2 remains wired only, with no support for wireless ‌CarPlay‌. The Polestar 2 also does not support Apple's EV routing and state of charge integration features, as offered on the Ford Mustang Mach E and Porsche Taycan.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/polestar/\">Polestar</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/01/polestar-2-update-brings-new-carplay-features/\">Polestar 2 Software Update Brings Wave of New Apple CarPlay Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/polestar-2-software-update-brings-wave-of-new-apple-carplay-features.2391250/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fdefe14d475416255122c428a9f1f7a96329f9aa39123304d320b4efa87bbcc4","category":"Apple"}
