Popular apps like Ulysses, iStat Menus, Spark, Unite, Yoink, and more are available through the current subscription service.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to MacPaw, Setapp will provide a \"carefully selected assortment of apps\" across categories like productivity, design, lifestyle, utility, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSetapp already offers a $12.49 subscription that provides access to both the iOS and Mac versions of apps, but EU users will be able to access Setapp apps without having to download them through the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>. Setapp will give developers a trusted alternative to ‌App Store‌ distribution with none of the standard fees, though it is worth noting that all apps that exceed 1 million first installs per year must pay the 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee to Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApps distributed through alternative app marketplaces are required to submit to a notarization process to ensure they are free from malware, but Apple does not have restrictions on content so apps that might not have been eligible for the ‌App Store‌ can be distributed through alternative means.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/setapp/\">Setapp</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/setapp-iphone-marketplace-may-14/\">Setapp's EU Alternative iPhone App Marketplace Launching on May 14</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/setapps-eu-alternative-iphone-app-marketplace-launching-on-may-14.2426241/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d4fe01681506ac5261496fbefe9c80563b86d1e6025cb1eec54a46e9435ae5e3","category":"Apple"}
