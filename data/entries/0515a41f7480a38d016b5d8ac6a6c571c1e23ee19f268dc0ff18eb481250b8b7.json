Sister company Eaglebear Bikes targets the parents of the kiddos that shred the lil’ gnar on their Prevelo bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-inside-the-shop-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-inside-the-shop-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Eaglebear Black inside the shop\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-inside-the-shop-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-inside-the-shop-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-inside-the-shop-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-inside-the-shop-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-inside-the-shop-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-inside-the-shop-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded in 2024 by Jacob Rheuban, Jim Huth, and Owen Dickson, Eaglebear Bikes is run out of the same facility as the Prevelo brand. That’s important because Prevelo has a stellar reputation with its customers for impeccable customer service.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Prevelo-boxes-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Prevelo-boxes-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Eaglebear Black Prevelo boxes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Prevelo-boxes-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Prevelo-boxes-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Prevelo-boxes-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Prevelo-boxes-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Prevelo-boxes-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Prevelo-boxes-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Being part of the same facility means that Eaglebear Bikes is part of an integrated effort with Prevelo. Using the same team to manage Eaglebear Bikes’ fulfillment, quick and thorough order customization and top-notch customer service can just about guarantee the same success that Prevelo has enjoyed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The <a href=\"https://eaglebear.com/collections/bikes/products/eaglebear-black\" target=\"_blank\">Eaglebear Black</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $1300</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-studio-shot-jpeg-e1729542150636.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"725\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-studio-shot-jpeg-e1729542150636.webp\" alt=\"Eaglebear Black studio shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-studio-shot-jpeg-e1729542150636.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-studio-shot-jpeg-e1729542150636-297x168.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-studio-shot-jpeg-e1729542150636-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-studio-shot-jpeg-e1729542150636-768x435.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo / Eaglebear Bikes)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Black is the first model for Eaglebear Bikes. There were a lot of ideas around how the bike was designed and spec’d.

Eaglebear publishes a claimed weight of 24.4 lbs (size medium), and my XL weighs in at a smidge over 26 lbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the bike is an awesome all-around bicycle. It has mounts for everything you need to attach. For instance, there are mounts for a top tube bag, three water bottle cages, fenders, front, and rear racks, as well as fork mounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-fork-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1081\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-fork-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Eaglebear Black fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-fork-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-fork-297x251.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-fork-120x101.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-fork-768x649.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The fork is a full carbon fork and takes a bit of the edge out of the small chatter bumps. The bike has very comfortable geometry that offers a nice upright riding position and would be great on any terrain. The stock saddle is very comfortable. I didn’t fully love the feel of the grips, but that is easy and cheap to fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Shimano-Deore-Drivetrain-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Shimano-Deore-Drivetrain-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Eaglebear Black Shimano Deore Drivetrain\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Shimano-Deore-Drivetrain-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Shimano-Deore-Drivetrain-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Shimano-Deore-Drivetrain-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Shimano-Deore-Drivetrain-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Shimano-Deore-Drivetrain-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Shimano-Deore-Drivetrain-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Deore-shifter-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Deore-shifter-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Eaglebear Black Deore shifter\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Deore-shifter-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Deore-shifter-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Deore-shifter-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Deore-shifter-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Deore-shifter-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-Deore-shifter-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Shimano Deore drivetrain is perfect for this type of bike. It is easy to adjust, and reliable, making perfect shifts all of the time. The 10-51 rear cassette provides a great amount of range. The non-branded crank gets the job done and should last a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-hydraulic-brakes-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-hydraulic-brakes-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Eaglebear Black hydraulic brakes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-hydraulic-brakes-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-hydraulic-brakes-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-hydraulic-brakes-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-hydraulic-brakes-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-hydraulic-brakes-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-hydraulic-brakes-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-shimano-hydros-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-shimano-hydros-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Eaglebear Black shimano hydros\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-shimano-hydros-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-shimano-hydros-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-shimano-hydros-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-shimano-hydros-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-shimano-hydros-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eaglebear-Black-shimano-hydros-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Shimano flat-mount hydraulic brakes are a nice touch on a bike at this price point. They look fantastic and stop with authority. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>In Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the bike “rides light”, rolls well, and pedals effortlessly. The geo feels nimble and predictable. It’s the perfect steed to go out with the family on a bike ride. The Eaglebear Black is a handsome bike for <em>anyone</em> who wants a simple “no-fuss” easy-to-use steed for everyday endeavors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for $1300, the Eaglebear Black isn’t priced out of reach. If you are in the market for a bicycle like this, I would highly recommend it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All direct-purchased bikes are tuned/customized before they ship, adding options that can be installed before the bike ships, like dropper posts, racks, and upgraded bars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more info, to reach out for questions, or to grab an Eaglebear Black for yourself, hit the link below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://eaglebear.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Eaglebear.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hq-tour-eaglebear-bikes-prevelo-team/\">HQ Tour: Prevelo Team Branches Out with Eaglebear Bikes for Mom/Dad</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"0515a41f7480a38d016b5d8ac6a6c571c1e23ee19f268dc0ff18eb481250b8b7","category":"Cycling"}
