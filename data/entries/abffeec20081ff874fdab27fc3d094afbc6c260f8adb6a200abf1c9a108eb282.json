Slate turns an ‌iPad‌ into a large trackpad for a Mac, complete with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> control.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/astropad-slate.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1124\" />\r<br />\nWith Slate, you can use an ‌iPad‌ and ‌Apple Pencil‌ to perform several useful tasks. The ‌Apple Pencil‌ serves as a cursor for controlling the desktop mouse, and a tap on the screen is used as a click.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen you write on the ‌iPad‌, it is translated into typed text on the Mac, and there are two-finger gestures for actions like scrolling and zoom. If you have a newer ‌iPad‌ that supports ‌Apple Pencil‌ hover, you can use the hover gestures. For older iPads, Astropad added a simulated hover option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn Mac apps that support drawing, sketching, and other creative work, you can use the ‌iPad‌ as a drawing tablet. It essentially serves as a no-screen interface for drawing, with the focus on the Mac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nYou'll need an ‌iPad‌ that runs iPadOS 15 or later and a Mac that runs macOS 11 or later to use Astropad Slate. The devices can be connected over Wi-Fi, Peer-to-Peer networking, or an appropriate USB cable.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://astropad.com/product/slate/\">Astropad Slate app</a> is priced at $19.99 and can be purchased from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>.
