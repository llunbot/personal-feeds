However, if you buy one of those new Macs, it won’t actually be able to run the new AI suite right when it arrives next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t worry, it’s not like the iPhone 16—the new computers do have the hardware and software to support Apple Intelligence on day one. They’ll just need a quick software update first. According to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/m4-macs-day-one-apple-intelligence-update/\">Macrumors</a>, the new M4 iMac, MacBook, and Mac mini will need an update to ‌<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2499054/ios-18-2-apple-intelligence-siri-genmoji-install-release-beta.html\">macOS Sequoia‌ 15.1</a> (build number 24B2083). The computers all ship with a special version of macOS Sequoia‌ 15.0 with build number 24A8332.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MacOS 15.1, of course, brings Apple intelligence to Apple silicon Macs, including Writing Tools, summaries, the new Siri interface, better search in Photos, and a new Reduce Interruptions Focus mode. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can also sign up for the macOS 15.2 beta, which brings several new Apple Intelligence features, including Genmoji, the Image Playground app, the new Mail app with AI-sorted categories, and integration with ChatGPT. That update is expected to arrive for all users in December.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9f2905ccfbad31342bd3c37e37b066cc3459c05636cbeb3b189b79a212069354","category":"Apple"}
