While I’ll stick to using lightweight tubes as a backup for my tubeless setup, they do offer some interesting options compared to the competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aeron-lightweight-tpu-bicycle-innertube-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"945\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aeron-lightweight-tpu-bicycle-innertube-1.jpg\" alt=\"aeron tpu inner tube shown rolled up, deflated.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aeron-lightweight-tpu-bicycle-innertube-1.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aeron-lightweight-tpu-bicycle-innertube-1-297x140.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aeron-lightweight-tpu-bicycle-innertube-1-1536x726.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aeron-lightweight-tpu-bicycle-innertube-1-120x57.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aeron-lightweight-tpu-bicycle-innertube-1-768x363.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>They roll up really small, like all TPU tubes, saving space in your saddle bag or pack.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>First, they have distinct versions for City bikes, road bikes, cyclocross and gravel, and mountain bikes. Within those, the performance bikes get SuperLite Race, ExtraLite Protect, and UltraProtect options. Here’s a quick overview of the options:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/aeron-lightweight-tpu-inner-tubes-retail-packaging-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"869\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/aeron-lightweight-tpu-inner-tubes-retail-packaging-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"aeron tpu inner tube retail packaging.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/aeron-lightweight-tpu-inner-tubes-retail-packaging-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/aeron-lightweight-tpu-inner-tubes-retail-packaging-297x101.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/aeron-lightweight-tpu-inner-tubes-retail-packaging-1536x521.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/aeron-lightweight-tpu-inner-tubes-retail-packaging-120x41.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/aeron-lightweight-tpu-inner-tubes-retail-packaging-768x261.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/aeron-lightweight-tpu-inner-tubes-retail-packaging-2048x695.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Road bike tubes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Three sizes are offered, all for 700c wheels only. The ExtraLite Protect and SuperLite Race fit tires measuring 23-28mm and 28-32mm wide, and the UltraProtect fit 25-35mm tires. All offer 42, 65, and 80mm valve stem lengths. Weights from 22-96g.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>CX/Gravel tubes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These have 42 and 65mm valve stem options, fit 32-52mm wide tires, and fit both 650B and 700c rim diameters. Weights from 31-129g depending on level of protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mountain bike tubes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Available for 27.5″ and 29″ rims to fit tires from 1.7″ to 2.5″, plus an oversized UltraProtect option for 2.5-3.0″ tires. Aeron’s TPU MTB tube weights range from 42-199g, and they have a glueless patch kit available for making repairs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>City/Touring bike tubes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These have the thickest walls for the most puncture protection, yet are up to 68% lighter than comparable butyl tubes. They’re available in 650b and 700c sizes to fit tires 37-50mm and 50-65mm wide, with both Presta and Schrader valve stem options. They have two levels of puncture protection, too, with weights from 67-156g.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aeron-lightweight-tpu-bicycle-innertube-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1605\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aeron-lightweight-tpu-bicycle-innertube-2.jpg\" alt=\"aeron tpu inner tube shown inflated.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aeron-lightweight-tpu-bicycle-innertube-2.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aeron-lightweight-tpu-bicycle-innertube-2-297x238.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aeron-lightweight-tpu-bicycle-innertube-2-1536x1233.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aeron-lightweight-tpu-bicycle-innertube-2-120x96.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aeron-lightweight-tpu-bicycle-innertube-2-768x616.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Aeron says TPU is 100% recyclable and can be turned back into new TPU tubes. MSRP ranges from €17.95 to €24.95, which compared to the recent increase in rubber tube costs, doesn’t sound like too much of a premium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.Aeron-tpu.com\" target=\"_blank\">Aeron-tpu.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/aeron-tpu-inner-tubes/\">Aeron Debuts Tougher, Lighter Ultralight TPU Inner Tubes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"9a196893418ab965fbfe524413ed6f5975daf0595b3f76a1082192c766874207","category":"Cycling"}
