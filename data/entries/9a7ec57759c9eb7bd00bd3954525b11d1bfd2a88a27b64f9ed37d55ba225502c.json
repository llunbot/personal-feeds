Apple confirmed this detail in its tech specs for the devices posted on the company's website.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-USB-C-Port-Event-Still.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThe higher-end iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are also equipped with a USB-C port, but those devices support USB 3 data transfer speeds of up to 10 Gbps over a cable. Unlike recent iPad Pro models, this means that the Pro models unfortunately do not support Thunderbolt, which theoretically supports speeds up to 40 Gbps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone 15 Pro models will require a supported cable, such as Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-usb-c-lightning-adapter-and-more/\">one-meter Thunderbolt 4 Pro cable</a>, to achieve USB 3 data transfer speeds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll four iPhone 15 models are available to pre-order this Friday and launch September 22.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/\">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-usb-port-limited-to-lightning-speeds/\">iPhone 15's USB-C Port Remains Limited to Lightning Speeds</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15s-usb-c-port-remains-limited-to-lightning-speeds.2401261/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9a7ec57759c9eb7bd00bd3954525b11d1bfd2a88a27b64f9ed37d55ba225502c","category":"Apple"}
