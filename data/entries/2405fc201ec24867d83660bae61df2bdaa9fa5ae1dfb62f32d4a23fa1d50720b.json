But the wait will be much shorter this yearâ€”Apple says that macOS 14 Sonoma will be available on September 26, just over a week after iOS 17 releases to the public <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/ios-17-hits-supported-devices-on-september-18/\">on September 18</a>. It will be the first update <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/features/2018/09/macos-10-14-mojave-the-ars-technica-review/\">since 2018's Mojave</a> to release in September rather than October.</p>\n<p>A longer gap between releases can occasionally make things awkward for people who like to update on day one, since Apple sometimes adds new features to iCloud-connected apps like Notes, Reminders, and Photos that will only work in the latest OS releases. A shorter gap between releases will reduce that kind of awkwardness.</p>\n\n<p>Sonoma is generally a low-key release, but it does include <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/five-cool-features-and-one-weird-thing-youll-find-in-macos-14-sonoma/\">a few headlining features</a>, including desktop widgets that can sync with your iPhone. A new Apple-made Game Porting Toolkit will make it easier for Windows game developers to get their titles up and running on Macs. Better screen sharing, revamped screen savers, an improved password manager, and a few other additions flesh out the update.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1967870#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1967870&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2405fc201ec24867d83660bae61df2bdaa9fa5ae1dfb62f32d4a23fa1d50720b","category":"Tech"}
