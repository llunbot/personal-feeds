Instead, it’s a sum of its\nattributes, the total package. It’s the feeling of incredible\nlightness, given its size, when I pick it up to move to another\nroom. The way it can sit on a bed or other soft surface and never\nget too hot or fire up some loud fans that aren’t even necessary\nor present in this device. How the battery just lasts and lasts\nand lasts, and makes a mockery of other companies’ “all-day\nbattery life” claims.</p>\n\n<p>It’s the little things, like effortlessly opening the lid with one\nfinger and seeing the display fire up instantly every single time.\nOr the combination of these daily successes, the sharp contrast\nwith the unpredictable experience that I get with every Windows\nlaptop I use, experiences that are so regular in their\nunpredictableness, so unavoidable, that I’ve almost stopped\nthinking about them. Until now, of course. The attention to detail\nand consistency I see in the MacBook Air is so foreign to the\nWindows ecosystem that it feels like science fiction. But having\nnow experienced it, my expectations are elevated.</p>\n\n<p>I want to be clear about this. There is <em>nothing</em> like this in the\nPC space. Any laptop that’s configured such that it can handle\nworkstation-class workloads will fire up jet engine-class fans for\nthe duration, while any laptop that gets decent battery life and\nis reasonably quiet is incapable of those higher-end workloads.\nThe MacBook Air does it all, in silence, without breaking a sweat.\nAnd it does so all day long on battery power.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fascinating perspective. Spot-on review.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/28/thurrott-m3-macbook-air\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"afa07dcacac958a394afd77e67eca7df279b07ac4703d74d976c0db2f1132f3d","category":"Tech"}
