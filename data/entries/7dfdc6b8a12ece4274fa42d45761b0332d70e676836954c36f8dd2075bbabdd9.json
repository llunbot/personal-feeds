Starting in the 2025 season, teams can integrate Nix’s real-time hydration data into their fueling strategies during the race. Will this help riders stay on top of their hydration needs, or is it adding more gadgetry to an athlete already overwhelmed by numbers? </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-full-pull-.png\"><img width=\"902\" height=\"730\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-full-pull-.png\" alt=\"NIX in the UCI full pull\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-full-pull-.png 902w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-full-pull--297x240.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-full-pull--120x97.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-full-pull--768x622.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Are Nix Biosensors and What Do They Do? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nix Biosensor provides real-time feedback on fluid loss and electrolyte levels through a lightweight, skin-mounted sensor. The sensor doesn’t pierce the skin like a CGM (continuous glucose monitor) but takes constant sweat samples from the subject. Data collected from the effort is sent to the Nix Pro app, where coaches or athletes can monitor their hydration status. Coaches can do this across the team on a centralized dashboard in real-time, say in a significant event.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-sensor-.png\"><img width=\"576\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-sensor-.png\" alt=\"NIX in the UCI sensor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-sensor-.png 576w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-sensor--297x220.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-sensor--120x89.png 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-patch-.png\"><img width=\"880\" height=\"580\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-patch-.png\" alt=\"NIX in the UCI patch\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-patch-.png 880w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-patch--297x196.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-patch--120x79.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-patch--768x506.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Alerts trigger as athletes approach critical thresholds, allowing for in-the-moment interventions that keep dehydration at bay. The patches that work as the barrier between the skin are disposable and can be used one time (one ride). The more significant brain center of the unit attaches to the disposable sticky piece and collects/distributes the data. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-.png\"><img width=\"1198\" height=\"806\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-.png\" alt=\"NIX in the UCI\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-.png 1198w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI--297x200.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI--120x81.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI--768x517.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>From Training to Competition</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Until now, the Nix Biosensor and its Nix Pro app were restricted to training. I’ve used one for myself and the athletes I coach with some success in hydration needs. I see benefits in auditing sweat loss through different workout settings and hydration mixes. But now, with UCI’s approval, teams can finally deploy this tool in the chaos of race-day conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-data-.png\"><img width=\"1174\" height=\"840\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-data-.png\" alt=\"NIX in the UCI data\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-data-.png 1174w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-data--297x213.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-data--120x86.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-data--768x550.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Will it help? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, but… I see this as a monitoring system that larger teams will use for very demanding races, the Tour de France, and anything where a DS (Directeur sportif) has the means to communicate with their riders. But maybe I’m still adjusting my sights to see what this will eventually become.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-graph-.png\"><img width=\"762\" height=\"542\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-graph-.png\" alt=\"NIX in the UCI graph\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-graph-.png 762w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-graph--297x211.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NIX-in-the-UCI-graph--120x85.png 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Athletes are dialed into their hydration needs, but they can always be better and more efficient. Especially when races get so chaotic that they forget or don’t have the means to consume what they need. Nix and teams like EF Pro Cycling feel there are more significant benefits. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“At EF Pro Cycling, hydration is one of our highest priorities for maintaining peak performance. Nix stood out for its accuracy and ease of use. We rolled it out across our men’s and women’s teams, giving us a real edge in understanding hydration trends for each rider.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Kevin Sprouse, EF Pro Cycling’s Director of Sports Science</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll report back as more information becomes available based on rider feedback.
