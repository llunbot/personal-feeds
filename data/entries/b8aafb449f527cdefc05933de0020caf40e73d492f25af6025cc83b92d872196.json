Over the years, the remit has broadened to increase focus on science, space, policy, culture, automobiles, AI, and more.</p>\n<p>You can expect our coverage in those areas to continue, but it's important for Ars to ensure our editors stay on top of what our readers are most interested in.

Is there a hunger for closer coverage of applications, toolkits, and issues relevant to professional software developers? Should we invest more effort in covering the latest AAA games on Steam?
