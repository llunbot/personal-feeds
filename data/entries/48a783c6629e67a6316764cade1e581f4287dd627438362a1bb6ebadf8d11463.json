There are also pages for the bands Coldplay and BTS.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEach page includes some basic details about the person or band, and showcases their related content across the Apple Music, Apple TV, and Apple Podcasts apps. For example, Billie Eilish's page highlights her songs in Apple Music, her Apple TV+ documentary from 2021, and her appearances on a variety of podcasts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Your favorites, at a glance,\" the page says. \"Discover more about the artists, actors, and athletes you love across Apple.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA tipster alerted us to the page's existence today, and we can confirm that snapshot.apple.com is a new address. Unfortunately, the page currently has a very basic design, with no search functionality. Apple has yet to officially announce the page, and it is unclear how or where the company plans to promote it.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/29/apple-snapshot-page/\">Apple Launches New 'Snapshot' Web Page: 'Your Favorites, At a Glance'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-new-snapshot-web-page-your-favorites-at-a-glance.2456184/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"48a783c6629e67a6316764cade1e581f4287dd627438362a1bb6ebadf8d11463","category":"Apple"}
