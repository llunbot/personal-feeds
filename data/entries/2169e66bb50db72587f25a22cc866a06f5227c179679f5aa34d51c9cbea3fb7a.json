{"title":"Get Apple’s newest iPad for $20 off at Amazon","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2685783/apples-newest-ipad-gets-its-biggest-discount-so-far.html","date":1744651078000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The new iPad A16 has barely been out a month and we’re already seeing a pretty good price cut. Over at Amazon, you can now <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display/dp/B0DZ751XN6/\">get the newest iPad for $328</a>, which means you’re saving $21, one of the best discounts we’ve seen so far. This offer is only good on the yellow color, so if you want pink, blue, or silver, it’ll cost you a little more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though it’s not all that different than the previous model, we gave this new tablet a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2646985/ipad-a16-review.html\">four-star rating in our review</a>, loving how affordable it is, as well as the excellent display and the overall strong performance. You’re also definitely not going to complain about battery life because this tablet will keep you going for hours and hours of work and play even with the brightness up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since this tablet has the A16 chip, it’s Apple’s only tablet that can’t run Apple Intelligence, which requires a minimum of an A17 Pro chip with 8GB of RAM. However, given how limited the Apple Intelligence experience is these days, you’re not missing much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you want a new iPad, this one’s <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1731145-REG/apple_mpq03ll_a_10_9_ipad_10th_gen.html\">a great deal at $328</a>, so make sure to add it to your cart sooner rather than later over before the price goes back up.</p>\n\n\n<span>Snag the newest iPad for $30 off</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display/dp/B0DZ751XN6/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at B&amp;H Photo</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2169e66bb50db72587f25a22cc866a06f5227c179679f5aa34d51c9cbea3fb7a","category":"Apple"}
