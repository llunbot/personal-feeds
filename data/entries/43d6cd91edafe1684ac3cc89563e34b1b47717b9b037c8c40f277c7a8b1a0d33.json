Basso</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Developed to provide powerful pedal-assist for rides over any surface, Basso’s new Volta is meant to be lightweight, tough, and versatile. With a powerful Polini motor, a big battery &amp; a relatively mid-range spec, Basso still claims a weight of just 15.2kg for their fast gravel ebike. The hi-mod Torayca carbon ebike certainly shares a lot of its looks with the well-rounded <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-bassos-new-palta-ii-gravel-bike-is-more-capable-well-rounded/\" target=\"_blank\">Palta II gravel bike</a> that I reviewed two years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_geometry.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_geometry.jpg\" alt=\"Basso Volta carbon gravel ebike, geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_geometry.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_geometry-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_geometry-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_geometry-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_geometry-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_geometry-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But it also shares very similar geometry that should ensure a similarly snappy ride. The Volta gets the same 71° head angle &amp; 73.5° seat angle but likely will shift the rider a bit back and up for more comfort with very slightly shorter frame Reach, generously taller Stack, and 15mm longer chainstays to fit the drive system in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in those seem like good choices for geometry tweaks tailored to a slightly less aggressive fit on an ebike that will likely serve a more relaxed rider – but while still preserving a fast, quick handling ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech specs</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_bikepacking-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_bikepacking-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Basso Volta carbon gravel ebike, bikepackign details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_bikepacking-detail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_bikepacking-detail-297x238.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_bikepacking-detail-800x640.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_bikepacking-detail-120x96.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_bikepacking-detail-768x614.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_bikepacking-detail-1536x1229.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Volta is powered by an Italian Polini E-P3+ ebike powertrain that we’ve not ridden before, but can also be found in the latest <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/mario-cipollini-fybra-gx-e-gravel-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Cipollini</a> gravel ebike. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_Polini-E-P3plus-motor.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_Polini-E-P3plus-motor.jpg\" alt=\"Basso Volta carbon gravel ebike, Polini E-P3+ motor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_Polini-E-P3plus-motor.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_Polini-E-P3plus-motor-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_Polini-E-P3plus-motor-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_Polini-E-P3plus-motor-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_Polini-E-P3plus-motor-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_Polini-E-P3plus-motor-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_Polini-E-P3plus-motor-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a pretty standard 250W mid-drive motor affair topping out with 75Nm of torque, and powered by a 500Wh battery that Basso has tucked into the oversized downtube. Claimed range is a whopping 220km, plus there’s an optional external 250Wh bottle battery range extender for those who want to ride with pedal-assist even further. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_Polini-powertrain-details.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_Polini-powertrain-details.jpg\" alt=\"Basso Volta carbon gravel ebike, Polini powertrain details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_Polini-powertrain-details.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_Polini-powertrain-details-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_Polini-powertrain-details-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_Polini-powertrain-details-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_Polini-powertrain-details-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_Polini-powertrain-details-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole ebike system is managed via a Polini 2.5″ TFT display that looks like a regular cycling head unit. Its out-front location does bring up the question of where a rider might put their regular GPS without losing the ebike monitoring functions?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_frame-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_frame-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Basso Volta carbon gravel ebike, frame detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_frame-detail.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_frame-detail-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_frame-detail-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_frame-detail-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_frame-detail-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Basso-Volta-carbon-gravel-ebike_frame-detail-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new ebike gets all the modern tech amenities with fully integrated hidden internal cables, semi-aero seatpost with Basso’s secure 3-bolt clamp. flat mount disc brakes, and 12mm thru-axles.
