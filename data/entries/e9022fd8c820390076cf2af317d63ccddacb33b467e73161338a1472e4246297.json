When you put a basket on a bike, it boosts that bike’s versatility up quite a few notches, that’s just a fact. Bikepacking rack aficionados, Old Man Mountain, has been teasing us with the <a href=\"https://oldmanmountain.com/product/basket/\" target=\"_blank\">OMM Basket</a> for some time, at both Sea Otter <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/old-man-mountain-elkhorn-rack/\" target=\"_blank\">2022</a> and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/old-man-mountain-new-basket-pannier-trunk-bag-velcro-patch/\" target=\"_blank\">2023</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, now it’s finally available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also have their new Ponderosa Panniers and Juniper Trunks in stock and available to ship as we speak. Plus, I saw a great little prototype that OMM was displaying at their booth at the MADE Show. Read about it below.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s go over these new goodies. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Old Man Mountain Basket</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-in-the-woods.jpeg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-in-the-woods.jpeg\" alt=\"Old Man Mountain Basket in the woods\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-in-the-woods.jpeg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-in-the-woods-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-in-the-woods-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-in-the-woods-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-in-the-woods-768x576.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo c. Old Man Mountain</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new basket is the same size as the wildly popular Wald 137 basket, making it compatible with all of the “137” <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-tunitas-carryall-basket-tote-137-a-grab-and-go-tote/\" target=\"_blank\">basket bags</a> that are out there. The difference is that the OMM Basket is powder-coated black aluminum, making it rugged, corrosion-proof, super durable, and lightweight. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-studio.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-studio-800x800.jpeg\" alt=\"Old Man Mountain Basket studio\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-molle-pattern.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-molle-pattern-800x800.jpeg\" alt=\"Old Man Mountain Basket molle pattern\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the OMM Basket can bolt to many OMM rack systems (as well as some other brands on the market), eliminating the zip ties needed to mount a Wald 137 to a rack. The basket “weave” pattern is Molle compatible, making it easy to attach your fave accessory pouches.   </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-giant.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-giant-800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Old Man Mountain Basket giant\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-giant-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-giant-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-giant-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-giant-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-giant.jpeg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The OMM Basket is ready for any basket bomber adventure you can think up.

OMM says that this makes sure that your panniers “don’t turn into Dumbo ears when you hit a bump, no matter how rough”. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Ponderosa-Panniers-front-side-e1695155853242.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Ponderosa-Panniers-front-side-e1695155853242-800x688.jpeg\" alt=\"Old Man Mountain Ponderosa Panniers front side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Ponderosa-Panniers-front-side-e1695155853242-800x688.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Ponderosa-Panniers-front-side-e1695155853242-297x255.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Ponderosa-Panniers-front-side-e1695155853242-120x103.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Ponderosa-Panniers-front-side-e1695155853242-768x660.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Ponderosa-Panniers-front-side-e1695155853242.jpeg 1197w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the compression straps are replaceable and easy to swap out should something happen to them. There is a traditional plastic frame sheet in the back (against the rack) of the bag. Additionally, there is another removable frame sheet on the frontside so it compresses evenly, allowing for the slimmest profile. Plus you can take it out to use as a cutting board for some charcuterie shenanigans. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>OMM offers subtle branding on the Ponderosa Panniers as well, being embossed into the loop velcro. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ponderosa Pannier Features and Retail</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $200 (sold as a pair)</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>100% waterproof: Made from TPU fabric with Hypalon reinforcements</li>\n\n\n\n<li>13 Liter Capacity</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Outer frame sheet for even compression and as a cutting board for charcuterie shenanigans</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lower Compression strap design means no floppy bags</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Replaceable straps</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minimal branding on velcro patches</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Silent contact points mean no more rattling and clanging bags. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Juniper Trunk</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Juniper-Trunk-on-rack-full-side.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Juniper-Trunk-on-rack-full-side-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Old Man Mountain Juniper-Trunk on rack full side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Juniper-Trunk-on-rack-full-side-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Juniper-Trunk-on-rack-full-side-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Juniper-Trunk-on-rack-full-side-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Juniper-Trunk-on-rack-full-side-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Juniper-Trunk-on-rack-full-side-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Old-Man-Mountain-Juniper-Trunk-on-rack-full-side.jpeg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Juniper Trunk is a bikepacking trunk bag that is ready for anything.

Stay tuned. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://oldmanmountain.com/\" target=\"_blank\">OldManMountain.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/old-man-mountain-basket-pannier-trunk-axle-pack-for-suspension-forks/\">Old Man Mountain’s Basket is Finally Here + Brilliant Axle Pack for Suspension Forks!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"e9022fd8c820390076cf2af317d63ccddacb33b467e73161338a1472e4246297","category":"Cycling"}
