This year Ramadan runs from 22nd March to 21st April.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset, neither eating nor drinking during the daylight hours. On breaking the fast at sunset Muslims have a meal called Iftar, and then another meal before sunrise called Suhour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The impact of Ramadan on cyclists will vary by training demands, but there are plenty of ways Muslim cyclists can best prepare and adapt their training and nutrition for the month.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Ramadan is a time to come together, cycle together, and then eat together after training,’ says Iffat Tejani, founder of <a href=\"https://evolvecyclingnetwork.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Evolve Cycling Network</a>, which is a space for women to cycle together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It is endurance of a different kind and brings Muslims all together to reflect on our faith, while also being a time of giving.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Ramadan is the month where we go back to our religion and where everything around you motivates you to be a better Muslim,’ adds Safiya Alsayegh, professional rider for UAE Team ADQ and a graphic design student.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The first week of Ramadan is all about adapting to the diet and timing changes and working out your sleep pattern.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Diet adaptations</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-2-2-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-2-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-2-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-2-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-2-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-2-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-2-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-2-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-2-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-2-2.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Having food before a ride can help energy levels. </figcaption><figcaption>Evolve</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘As you’re not eating throughout the day, you need to get a proper meal in as soon as you break your fast because then you’re training after that for maybe an hour or two,’ says Alsayegh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s tricky because you need to eat enough but not too much that you feel zoned out. In our traditions we have quite a lot of fried stuff, but I try to avoid the oily stuff because it can be really heavy on the stomach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘As soon as I get on the bike the blood starts flowing and I feel more awake. Sometimes I have an espresso shot to wake up my system.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We make a lot of date smoothies, as they are a source of protein and energy and are delicious,’ Tejani says. ‘I add dates, oats and some protein powder too.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sports nutritionist <a href=\"https://robhobson.co.uk/nutritionist-london/\" target=\"_blank\">Rob Hobson </a>advises that cyclists should make the most of eating times during Ramadan while also being conscious of what they consume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The Suhour meal should be eaten as close as possible to sunrise and try to include carbs, especially low GI carb foods such as brown rice, pasta or oats. These are better for the dawn meal given their slower release of glucose.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I’d also add in protein-rich foods as these digest more slowly and can help with protein balance during the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Try to consume at least 20g of rapidly digested and absorbed protein soon after exercise in the evening which could be in the form of a shake made from whey.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Hydration strategy</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-4-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-4.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Being conscientious with hydration is important during Ramadan. </figcaption><figcaption>Evolve</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>During Ramadan, Muslims do not drink anything during the fasting hours, so a good hydration strategy is important for cyclists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Wearing a buff is a really good way to stop any dryness in the mouth when cycling, and always bring a drink with you when you ride after you’ve broken your fast,’ says Iffat Tejani.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s important to keep an eye on your hydration throughout the month, as being dehydrated can cause dizziness and really affect training.’ explains Hobson. ‘There are small things which can help with limiting sweat loss like choice of clothing as well as reducing warm-ups and cool-downs.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘A good way to really help with hydration is through <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-in-hot-weather-advice\">electrolytes</a> which contain helpful minerals like sodium. I would also try spreading fluid intake after sunset, so rather than drinking lots in one go, have small drinks frequently.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are countless suitable electrolytes on the market but if you need specific suggestions, <a href=\"https://www.healthspanelite.co.uk/shop/elite-activ-hydrate/citrus-twist-flavour-40-tablets/\" target=\"_blank\">Healthspan Elite Activ Hydrate</a>, <a href=\"https://www.precisionhydration.com/products/ph-1500-low-calorie-electrolyte-supplement/\" target=\"_blank\">Precision Hydration PH1500</a> or <a href=\"https://fourfive.com/product/hydrate/\" target=\"_blank\">Fourfive Hydrate</a> tablets are all decent options.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Reducing intensity </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-3-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/evolve-3.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Muslims often get together to ride during Ramadan.  </figcaption><figcaption>Evolve / Rapha</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Many people prefer to reduce the tempo slightly for obvious reasons and perhaps choose less punchy inclines, often focussing on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/getting-in-the-zone\" target=\"_blank\">zone 1 or zone 2</a> type rides with less elevation that usual,’ explains Zahir Nayani, a lawyer and founder of the Fasted 500. The Fasted 500 is a challenge which encourages Muslim cyclists to ride 500 kilometres sensibly over Ramadan, and is inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/rapha-festive-500-strava-challenge-this-christmas\" target=\"_blank\">Rapha Festive 500</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You really don’t want to become unstuck during the day, so keeping things sensible and not experimenting too much is key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Training in the evening is also a really popular choice,’ adds Nayani. ‘It tends to be cooler then and, with some strategic timing, a ride and subsequent shower could end to coincide with the start of the evening Iftar meal and a hot cup of tea. Fasted rides when undertaken sensibly by those who are familiar with Ramadan can feel pretty ethereal from a clarity of mind perspective.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alsayegh opts for evening rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I do my longer, more intense rides after praying and eating and then head off to the track,’ she explains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s also safe riding there in the dark and what I really love about Ramadan is that everybody is training at the same time as they have the same schedule. You can catch up with people and ride with friends. It’s very special.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tejani also advises reducing the intensity of hill climbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Drop your cadence when you are climbing and choose routes which aren’t super hilly. Including lots of hard climbs can really tire you out and Ramadan is a marathon not a sprint, so definitely worth bearing this in mind.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n

praying, sleep can be challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The sleep cycle can be compressed owing to congregational night prayers that traditionally take place during Ramadan at the Mosque,’ explains Nayani. ‘Congregational prayers add a palpable sense of community spirit during Ramadan but brevity often isn’t on the agenda, with prayers typically lasting between one to two hours.’<em> </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Sleep is so key and it’s so important for the body to recover but it can also be one of the more challenging parts of Ramadan,’ says Alsayegh. ‘After an evening ride I
