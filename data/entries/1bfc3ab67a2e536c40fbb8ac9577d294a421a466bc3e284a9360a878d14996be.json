Then keep reading to learn how to take advantage of the new Level option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/iPhone-14-Pro-Rear-Camera.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nFor a while now, Apple's Camera app has included a few optional settings that can help you line up your shots. There's a Grid that can be overlaid on the viewfinder to help apply the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds\">rule of thirds</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/hidden-camera-level-tool-ios-11/\">somewhat-hidden leveling feature</a> for top-down photos that displays a floating crosshair to help you line up your subject properly.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith ‌iOS 17‌, Apple has further enhanced the camera leveling functionality by separating it out from the Grid mode. By making it an individual option, Apple has also included an additional horizontal level for more traditional straight-on photos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-camera-level-no.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" />\r<br />\nTurning the Level option on will pop up a broken horizontal line on the screen when your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> senses you're lining up for a straight-on shot and you tilt your device slightly out of horizontal. The line appears white while your phone is out of level and then turns yellow once you achieve a level orientation to indicate success.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-camera-level.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" />\r<br />\n<h2>How to Enable the Camera Level</h2> \r<br />\nThe new Level option is off by default if you don't have Grid mode enabled. You can turn it on manually by following these steps.\r<br />\n<ol><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your ‌iPhone‌.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Scroll down and select <strong>Camera</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Under the \"Composition\" section, toggle on the switch next to <strong>Level</strong>.</li></ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/ios-17-camera-level.jpg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"2860\" height=\"2700\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNow open the Camera app and try shooting a subject at a straight angle, and you should see the broken horizontal lines in the center of the viewfinder. Straighten your angle up to connect the lines and make a single yellow line.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe leveling pop-up only appears briefly and only within a narrow range of angles close to horizontal (in either portrait or landscape orientation), so it won't intrusively pop up when you're intentionally trying to take a photo at an angle.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photography/\">Photography</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-17-straighten-camera-shooting-angle/\">iOS 17: How to Straighten Your Shooting Angle With the New Camera Level Feature</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-how-to-straighten-your-shooting-angle-with-the-new-camera-level-feature.2395597/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1bfc3ab67a2e536c40fbb8ac9577d294a421a466bc3e284a9360a878d14996be","category":"Apple"}
