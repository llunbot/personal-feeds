After answering questions posted by his own lawyers, Bankman-Fried will have to face cross-examination from federal prosecutors. But after three weeks in which US government attorneys laid out their case, including <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/sbfs-dream-of-being-us-president-and-other-weird-anecdotes-from-ftx-trial/\">testimony</a> from former FTX and Alameda executives, Bankman-Fried's legal team <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/sam-bankman-fried-may-testify-in-hopes-of-avoiding-life-in-prison/\">announced</a> yesterday that he would take the stand.</p>\n<p>Today's testimony was unusual because US District Judge Lewis Kaplan sent the jury home for the day to conduct a hearing on whether certain parts of his testimony are admissible. \"That means Bankman-Fried will give some of his testimony to the judge without the jury present. The judge will then decide whether Bankman-Fried is allowed to say the same testimony in front of a jury,\" The Wall Street Journal wrote in its <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/sam-bankman-fried-trial-testimony/card/sam-bankman-fried-takes-the-stand-sort-of--1UleQq5TTaYXvQEYrqas\">live coverage</a>.
