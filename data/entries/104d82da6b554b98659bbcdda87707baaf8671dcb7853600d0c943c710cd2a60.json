Like Dolby Vision, HDR10+ is a more advanced form of HDR that uses dynamic metadata fine-tuned to specific content. HDR10+ and Dolby Vision let creatives set how each frame looks, enabling a final result that should have more detail and look closer to how the content's creators intended. HDR10+ and Dolby Vision are especially impactful when watching HDR content on lower-priced HDR TVs that could suffer from poor black levels and other performance gaps.</p>\n<p>You have to subscribe to Netflix's Premium ad-free plan to stream content in HDR and 4K resolution. The plan is $25 per month, compared to $18 per month for the Standard ad-free plan that limits users to 1080p resolution.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/netflix-aims-to-support-hdr10-in-all-hdr-titles-by-the-end-of-this-year/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/netflix-aims-to-support-hdr10-in-all-hdr-titles-by-the-end-of-this-year/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"104d82da6b554b98659bbcdda87707baaf8671dcb7853600d0c943c710cd2a60","category":"Tech"}
