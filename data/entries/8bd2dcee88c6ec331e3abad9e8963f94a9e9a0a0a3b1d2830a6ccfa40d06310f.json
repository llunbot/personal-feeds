That’s because they just hit their 2025 low: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/\">Amazon is selling the AirPods Pro 2 for just $169</a>, a massive savings of more than 30 percent off the $249 MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These earbuds are easily one of our favorites, as the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1207444/airpods-pro-2-review-2.html\">4.5-star rating</a> we gave them hasn’t changed since 2022. As we mentioned back then, the AirPods Pro 2 earbuds still deliver fantastic audio quality, are excellent at noise canceling, and have a “best-in-class” transparency mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“On the outside, not much has changed with these second-generation AirPods Pro. But the sound quality has improved a lot, noise cancelling is much better, transparency mode is top-notch, and battery life is finally up to par. There’s not a lot here you can’t find on other models, but Apple makes it easy and has caught up to its fierce competition,” the review reads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they’ve only gotten better since then. Through a steady stream of updates, Apple has made the AirPods Pro 2 even better since their release, with <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/541938/airpods-pro-conversation-boost-how-to.html\">Conversation Boost</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2498966/your-airpods-pro-2-can-now-work-as-a-hearing-aid-heres-how.html\">Hearing Protection</a>, which lets you test your hearing with AirPods Pro and use them as an actual hearing aid. Plus, you’ll get all the great Apple ecosystem stuff you love: instant pairing, hands-free Siri support, notification announcements, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, go get your own <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/\">Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $169 while Amazon</a> still has them on sale.</p>\n\n\n<span>Save big on the superb AirPods Pro 2</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"8bd2dcee88c6ec331e3abad9e8963f94a9e9a0a0a3b1d2830a6ccfa40d06310f","category":"Apple"}
