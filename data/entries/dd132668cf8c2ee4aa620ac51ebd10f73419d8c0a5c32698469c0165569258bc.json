Most are made of impact-resistant polycarbonate or nylon to provide better protection. Some have polarised lenses, while other brands use proprietary technology to enhance contrasts and make obstacles or flaws on the tarmac or trail more visible. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/cycling-sunglasses-the-best-photochromic-sunglasses-for-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Photochromic lenses</a> can also be used for changing light conditions based on the weather or riding under tree cover. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lenses can feature hydrophobic or oleophobic treatments to prevent liquids or fingerprints from marking and obscuring vision, while scratch protective coatings can improve longevity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Practical features to look out for are the ability to change lenses for different weather conditions, as well as buying replacement lenses rather than a new pair of glasses if needed. Adjustable or multiple nosepieces are useful to tailor fit given people will have different nose shapes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Non-slip coatings on the arms are vital and hydrophilic ones that keep glasses secure even when sweaty are especially useful. Finally, some level of ventilation is useful especially around the brow to prevent your face getting too warm and also reducing the chance of fogging in wet or humid conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reviews of the best cycling sunglasses</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>100% Aerocraft: RRP £175 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/100-aerocraft-sunglasses-review\" target=\"_blank\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>100% Slendale: RRP £100 –<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/100-slendale-sunglasses-review\" target=\"_blank\"> read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>BBB Chester: RRP £54.99 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/bbb-chester-sunglasses-review\" target=\"_blank\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Koo Demos: RRP £180 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/koo-demos-sunglasses-review\" target=\"_blank\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Madison Code Breaker II: RRP £40 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/madison-code-breaker-ii-sunglasses-review\" target=\"_blank\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Oakley Encoder Strike: RRP £228 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/oakley-encoder-strike-sunglasses-review\" target=\"_blank\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Oakley Sutro Lite Sweep Vent: RRP £168 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/oakley-sutro-lite-sweep-sunglasses-review\" target=\"_blank\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Oakley Spherea: RRP £231 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/oakley-sphaera-sunglasses-review\" target=\"_blank\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Roka Matador Air: RRP £220 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/roka-matador-air-sunglasses-review\" target=\"_blank\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Scicon Aeroscope: RRP £195 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/scicon-aeroscope-sunglasses-review\" target=\"_blank\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Scicon Aeroshade Kunken: RRP £175 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/scicon-aeroshade-kunken-sunglasses-review\" target=\"_blank\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>SunGod Airas: RRP £140-£180 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sungod-airas-sunglasses-review\" target=\"_blank\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>SunGod Vulcans: RRP £140-£180 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sungod-vulcans-sunglasses-review-2\" target=\"_blank\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>How do we test and why trust Cyclist’s advice?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/giro-aries-helmet-review-10-e1709903779857-970x754.jpg\" alt=\"White Giro Aries Spherical helmet\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All of our product reviewers are avid cyclists who have been cycling for many years.

They feature the new 3DPlane Molded Lens technology, which allows the lens to blend seamlessly into the frame of the glasses. It also means the lens can be shaped differently to standard cylindrical lenses, with folded edges to improve both field of view and protection. It works well in practice, but there is some distortion around the edges and sweat can pool at the bottom. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lens also uses 100%’s HiPER technology, which is designed to improve contrast of certain light wavelengths, similar to Oakley’s Prizm lens. This technology works brilliantly, helping highlight potholes and obstacles on the tarmac. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Purple Multilayer Mirror lens is superb across a range of conditions thanks to the 29% light transmission. This means it protects nicely against bright sunlight but is not so dark that it can’t be used in lower light conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn’t all rosy though, as the protective brow pad along the top of the lens reduces airflow to the brow, and means your face can get a little warm in hotter weather. Additionally, although it comes with a hard and soft case, there are no replacement lens options available, even though the lens is actually very easy to remove. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The price is also high at £174.99 and 100% doesn’t offer the lens guarantees found on some similarly priced glasses.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/100-aerocraft-sunglasses-review\" target=\"_blank\">100% Aerocraft sunglasses review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>100% Slendale</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Cyclist-Badge_Great-1.png\" /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"652\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/100pc-Slendale_01-970x652.jpg\" alt=\"100% Slendale sunglasses\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/100pc-Slendale_01-970x652.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/100pc-Slendale_01-300x202.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/100pc-Slendale_01-768x516.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/100pc-Slendale_01-1536x1032.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/100pc-Slendale_01-2048x1376.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/100pc-Slendale_01-750x504.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/100pc-Slendale_01-1140x766.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Price: £99.99 / $119 / €129</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Superb lens</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Great value</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Practical frame</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The 100% Slendale glasses are 100%’s cheapest sport model to use its HiPER lens technology, designed to enhance the contrast and enhance details and colours. This improves the detail of the terrain where you’re riding and in practice works brilliantly for picking up on potholes and over obstacles or imperfections on the road. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lens is also hydrophobic, oleophobic and scratch resistant, and although I haven’t tested the scratch resistance directly, the other features work very well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame is a TR90 plastic and extends slightly outwards beyond the lens, more so than many other brands. This has a brilliant practical benefit of preventing the lenses hitting the ground in the event of being dropped, as I accidentally tested. The frame is slightly visible around the nosepiece, and although not enough to be a true obstruction, it can sometimes detract from an otherwise broad field of view. The lens is large enough that the top of the frame is not visible when riding, even in a more aggressive position. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Slendales don’t come with a dedicated case, just a cardboard box, but it does come at a very reasonable price. At £99.99 it is easily one of the best lenses available for under £100, whereas many competitors are significantly more expensive, making this great value. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/100-slendale-sunglasses-review\" target=\"_blank\">100% Slendale sunglasses review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>BBB Chester</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Cyclist-Badge_Great-1.png\" /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/BBBChester01-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"BBB Chester sunglasses from the front worn by review writer\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/BBBChester01-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/BBBChester01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/BBBChester01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/BBBChester01-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/BBBChester01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/BBBChester01-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/BBBChester01-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/BBBChester01-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/BBBChester01-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/BBBChester01-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Andy Turner</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Price: £54.99</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Very good value for money</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Made from bio-based material</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lens can experience glare</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The BBB Chester glasses utilise a bio-based polyamide frame made up of 45% castor bean-derived carbon, while rubber is used for the arms and the adjustable nosepiece. The frame feels good quality, and while the glasses are heavier than some higher-end competitors, it isn’t noticeable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lens is impressive, with great hydro and oleophobic properties, while the performance in sunny conditions is good except for glare in direct sunlight and dappled conditions. The lens can’t be changed, but at £54.99 a replacement pair of glasses is cheaper than some replacement lenses on this list. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with this great value though, some fit elements do let the BBB Chesters down. The arms can slip down the face when sweaty, and the nosepiece is not the most comfortable, with the glasses either sitting too close to the face with the frame in contact with the nose, or air flowing straight into the eyes. But I do like a pair of glasses that sits a little away from my face and has a deep and narrow nosepiece. The BBB Chesters fit the bill on both counts.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/bbb-chester-sunglasses-review\" target=\"_blank\">BBB Chester sunglasses review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Koo Demos</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KOODemos01-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Koo Demos sunglasses\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KOODemos01-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KOODemos01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KOODemos01-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KOODemos01-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KOODemos01-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KOODemos01-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KOODemos01-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KOODemos01-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KOODemos01-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KOODemos01-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Price: £180 / $210 / €210</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Amazing photochromic lens</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Adjustable nosepiece </strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sit quite close to the brow</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Koo Demos are a full frame pair of glasses made from a high-impact-resistant Grilamid frame with Megol inserts in the arms to provide ample grip even when sweaty. In practice, they work very well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although a full frame design, the lower section of the frame is particularly thin so that even when looking behind, peripheral vision is not impaired. At 31g they are also impressively lightweight, and for added fit adjustment they feature both an adjustable nosepiece and a spare one. These are quite tough to change out however. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lens is made in conjunction with Zeiss and features great clarity and contrast, while anti-reflective treatments internally and externally prevent any glare. The photochromic lens changes light transmission from between 12% and 75% and reacts very quickly – better than any lens I’ve used before. An option to use a clip-in insert also accommodates prescription lenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately though the glasses sit very close to the forehead, with no real way to adjust it. That means in warm weather sweat from the brow can easily get onto the lens. At £180 the Koo Demos glasses are also not cheap, but that price is inflated by the inclusion of the photochromic lens.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/koo-demos-sunglasses-review\" target=\"_blank\">Koo Demos sunglasses review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Madison Code Breaker II </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Cyclist-Badge_Great-1.png\" /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/MadisonCodebreaker01-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Madison Code Breaker sunglasses from front\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/MadisonCodebreaker01-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/MadisonCodebreaker01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/MadisonCodebreaker01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/MadisonCodebreaker01-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/MadisonCodebreaker01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/MadisonCodebreaker01-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/MadisonCodebreaker01-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/MadisonCodebreaker01-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/MadisonCodebreaker01-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/MadisonCodebreaker01-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Andy Turner</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Price: £39.99</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Incredible value for money</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Two spare lenses supplied</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rubber grips aren’t the best</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Madison Code Breaker II glasses share a very similar profile to the popular Oakley Jawbreakers and use a full frame made of TR-90 material to offer shatter resistance and flexibility to protect the rider’s face. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lens is spherical in design, which helps in offering a large field of view, as well as featuring very effective vent holes. The lens can be switched out and three are included with the Codebreakers: a Cat 3 lens for brighter sun, and a Cat 1 and Cat 0 for rainy or darker conditions. The Cat 3 lens works well in most light but can experience glare in direct bright sunlight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rubber grips on the arms of the glasses are effective until sweat builds up, but then they can be slippery. The nosepiece is adjustable but, when you make it narrower, air can get behind the lens and into the eyes. Small niggles aside though, the performance is really good, and for £39.99 these are the cheapest glasses on test, in some cases around a fifth the price of others.  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/madison-code-breaker-ii-sunglasses-review\" target=\"_blank\">Madison Code Breaker II sunglasses review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Oakley Encoder Strike </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/OakleyEncoder01-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Oakley Encoder Strike glasses from the front\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/OakleyEncoder01-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/OakleyEncoder01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/OakleyEncoder01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/OakleyEncoder01-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/OakleyEncoder01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/OakleyEncoder01-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/OakleyEncoder01-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/OakleyEncoder01-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/OakleyEncoder01-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/OakleyEncoder01-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Andy Turner</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Price: £228 / $264 / €245</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Great wraparound lens</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Huge field of view</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Can’t change lens</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Oakley Encoder Strike sunglasses feature Oakley’s signature O-Matter impact-resistant frame and ‘Unobtainium’ rubber arms and nosepiece for added grip when sweating. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Prizm lens is fantastic across a range of light conditions and really does improve contrast on road surfaces to highlight any imperfections or holes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>PhysioMorphic technology is used in the lens to allow a greater wrap around the face and improve field of view while vents have been added to the top to aid brow ventilation.

The frame can also be tailored to use a half frame at the base, or remove that for a zero frame. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found the half frame obstructed vision when looking behind, it also adds to the overall price. Opt for both half and zero frames and the price gets quite high.

It’s useful to understand what they mean: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cat 0 is 80-100% light transmission with either no tint or a very light tint. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cat 1 is 43-80% light transmission and features a light tint, often pink, orange or yellow. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cat 2 is 18-43% light transmission with a medium tint. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cat 3 is 8-18% light transmission and has a darker tint, often coloured and mirrored. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cat 4 is 3-8% light transmission and features a very dark tint. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Cat 2 and 3 are most common as standard cycling lenses, while Cat 0 is often used for darker conditions or in the rain. Cat 4 lenses aren’t generally useful for cycling, unless you are riding in bright sunshine in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-maintain-your-bike-in-the-snow\" target=\"_blank\">snow</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/atlas-mountain-race\" target=\"_blank\">across a desert</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also buy <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/cycling-sunglasses-the-best-photochromic-sunglasses-for-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">photochromic lenses</a>, which change their light transmission based on the sunlight they are exposed to. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best cycling sunglasses often feature lens technology that changes the highlights and contrasts of certain light wavelengths to make obstacles more visible on the road. These include Prizm in Oakley glasses, HiPER in 100%’s and ChromaPop in Smith’s.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What should I look for in cycling glasses? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A good-quality lens is the first thing to look for. Often hydro or oleophobic treatments can feature which reduce the chance of water or dirt sticking to the lens and impairing your vision. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other things to look for are the ability to change out the lens for different conditions, a fit that is comfortable yet secure and, ideally, low weight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some riders may prefer a full frame for added protection, while others may prefer a half frame or even zero frame to enhance the field of view and peripheral vision. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why do I need cycling sunglasses? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The main purpose of cycling sunglasses is to offer protection for the eyes both from the sun and objects. The ability to block the transmission of harmful UV rays is key, while high impact protection will protect the user in the event of stones, chips or tree branches impacting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What if I need prescription glasses? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately many sunglasses are not compatible with prescription lenses, so contact lenses may have to be worn. However, there are a few brands that either allow you to order custom prescription lenses or sell clip-in inserts that can allow prescription lenses to be fitted behind the main sunglass lens. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-jerseys-for-summer-reviewed-and-how-to-choose-one\">Best cycling jerseys for summer reviewed and how to choose one</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-helmet\">Best cycling helmet: Road and gravel bike helmets from under £100 reviewed</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-aero-helmets\">Best aero road cycling helmets reviewed 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/oakley-hq-factory-visit\">Oakley HQ : factory visit</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-sunglasses\">Best cycling sunglasses reviewed 2024</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"jcunningham","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"dd132668cf8c2ee4aa620ac51ebd10f73419d8c0a5c32698469c0165569258bc","category":"Cycling"}
