Just minutes later, however, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman put the kibosh on that rumor.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iPhone-SE-4-Single-Camera-Thumb-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIn a follow-up <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1876731783586136304\">social media post</a>, Gurman said an iPhone SE replacement and new iPads are \"being developed on the iOS 18.3 train,\" but that \"doesn't mean\" the software updates and the devices will launch simultaneously. Instead, Gurman said Apple is aiming to release the devices \"by April,\" at some point \"before iOS 18.4\" is released.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo, there you have it. Sometimes one rumor quickly leads to another, and now we have a clearer timeframe for the launch of these devices.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/07/iphone-se-4-and-ipad-11-by-april/\">Apple Aiming to Launch iPhone SE 4 and iPad 11 'By April'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-aiming-to-launch-iphone-se-4-and-ipad-11-by-april.2446925/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"41d729129b7e2dfd0f941eb880c9bf8056d6b72d22655135c7f358e569c36222","category":"Apple"}
