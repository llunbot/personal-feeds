The promised Siri upgrades will be powered by Apple Intelligence, so you will need an iPhone 15 Pro or newer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"We've also been working on a more personalized Siri, giving it more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps,\" said Apple, in a statement <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features\">shared with <em>Daring Fireball</em>'s John Gruber</a>. \"It's going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman said Apple was initially aiming to launch the more personalized Siri <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/ios-18-4-apple-intelligence-powered-siri/\">as part of iOS 18.4</a>, which is already in beta and lacks any of the promised features. He then said that the features were delayed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/02/siri-apple-intelligence-likely-ios-18-5/\">until iOS 18.5 in May</a>, but Apple's statement suggests the features will take even longer to arrive. The more personalized Siri will likely debut at some point between iOS 19 in September 2025 and iOS 19.4 in March 2026. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhenever they launch, the Siri upgrades will include understanding of a user's personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls. For example, during its WWDC 2024 keynote, Apple showed an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans based on info from the Mail and Messages apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith these new Siri capabilities rumored to be at the core of Apple's smart home hub, it would make sense if the company has pushed back its internal timeframe for launching the device. It's not ideal to launch one without the other. This is not an official delay, given that Apple never publicly announced plans to release a home hub, but it is clear that Apple has missed its internal targets for the more personalized Siri and this related project.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/26/homepod-hub-with-7-inch-screen-rumor/\">previously said</a> the home hub would be \"Apple's most significant release of the year,\" as it represents the company's \"first step toward a bigger role in the smart home.\" He said the device will be like a \"smaller and cheaper iPad\" that lets users \"control appliances, conduct FaceTime chats, and handle other tasks.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe device is expected to be similar to a HomePod with a screen, with rumored features including a 6-inch or 7-inch display, an A18 chip, and Apple Intelligence support. Gurman said it can be attached to a tabletop base with a speaker, or mounted on a wall.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo, when will Apple's home hub launch? \"In the coming year\" probably applies here, too.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/\">Apple Command Center</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/09/apple-smart-home-hub-postponed/\">Apple's Smart Home Hub Now 'Postponed' Due to Delayed Siri Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-smart-home-hub-now-postponed-due-to-delayed-siri-features.2452614/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"99eb24f73a375897d34506ae6fdf277caa218ceba969c5d5ce697a0efa658cfb","category":"Apple"}
