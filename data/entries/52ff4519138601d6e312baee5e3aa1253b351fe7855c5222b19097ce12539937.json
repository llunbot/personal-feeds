For 2023, the pair were back in South Africa to defend their title, under the banner of Orbea x Leatt x Speed Company Racing. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lukas-baum-orbea-x-leatt-x-speed-company-racing-changing-post-stage-6-2023-cape-epic.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lukas-baum-orbea-x-leatt-x-speed-company-racing-changing-post-stage-6-2023-cape-epic-800x1200.jpg\" alt=\"lukas baum cuts back shoulder after crash stage 6 cape epic 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lukas-baum-orbea-x-leatt-x-speed-company-racing-changing-post-stage-6-2023-cape-epic-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lukas-baum-orbea-x-leatt-x-speed-company-racing-changing-post-stage-6-2023-cape-epic-200x300.jpg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lukas-baum-orbea-x-leatt-x-speed-company-racing-changing-post-stage-6-2023-cape-epic-80x120.jpg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lukas-baum-orbea-x-leatt-x-speed-company-racing-changing-post-stage-6-2023-cape-epic-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lukas-baum-orbea-x-leatt-x-speed-company-racing-changing-post-stage-6-2023-cape-epic-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lukas-baum-orbea-x-leatt-x-speed-company-racing-changing-post-stage-6-2023-cape-epic-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lukas-baum-orbea-x-leatt-x-speed-company-racing-changing-post-stage-6-2023-cape-epic.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Lukas getting changed outside the camper van after a grueling Stage 6 – during which he clearly survived an unintentional dismount</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lukas-baum-georg-egger-campervan-2023-cape-epic-orbea-oiz-race-bikes.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lukas-baum-georg-egger-campervan-2023-cape-epic-orbea-oiz-race-bikes-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"orbea x leatt x speed company racing campervan accomodation throughout 2023 cape epic with orbea oiz race mtb\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lukas-baum-georg-egger-campervan-2023-cape-epic-orbea-oiz-race-bikes-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lukas-baum-georg-egger-campervan-2023-cape-epic-orbea-oiz-race-bikes-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lukas-baum-georg-egger-campervan-2023-cape-epic-orbea-oiz-race-bikes-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lukas-baum-georg-egger-campervan-2023-cape-epic-orbea-oiz-race-bikes-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lukas-baum-georg-egger-campervan-2023-cape-epic-orbea-oiz-race-bikes-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lukas-baum-georg-egger-campervan-2023-cape-epic-orbea-oiz-race-bikes-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lukas-baum-georg-egger-campervan-2023-cape-epic-orbea-oiz-race-bikes.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Lukas and Georg’s homes for the eight days; the camper van was their “secure zone” – any support staff entering had to sanitize their hands</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, these guys are not on a Factory Team. While many of their competitors would have been recuperating in hotels and apartments, Georg and Lukas made a Camper Van their home for the week, with their support team pitched up nearby in tents, battling it out with the most rainfall the region has seen in 20 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Georg and Lukas had an incredible race; despite mechanical issues and several “floor kissing” events, the pair placed 2nd in the Overall and bagged two Stage Wins along the way – including the final stage which saw them sprint into the finish arena 10 seconds ahead of Overall Winners, Christopher Blevins and Mathew Beers. While they were in the lead after Stage 5, a costly mechanical on Stage 6 put them back in 3rd Position. The series of mishaps – missing bottles at feed zones, crashing, unfortunate line choice and a bust derailleur that cost them a whopping 11 minutes, Georg and Lukas were considering re-naming the team “Speed Company Chaos Racing”. In the end, they decided against.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the dust settled, and pizza was consumed, we hopped on a call with Georg and Lukas to hear exactly what went down. They also shared with us the details of their 2023 Orbea Oiz Race Bikes, as well as some teasers on some new Endurance Kit from Leatt, the development of which they were heavily involved in.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-georg-egger-lukas-baum-speed-company-racing-Orbea-Oiz-XCO-Bikes.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-georg-egger-lukas-baum-speed-company-racing-Orbea-Oiz-XCO-Bikes-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"2023 cape epic lukas baum georg egger orbea x leatt x speed company racing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-georg-egger-lukas-baum-speed-company-racing-Orbea-Oiz-XCO-Bikes-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-georg-egger-lukas-baum-speed-company-racing-Orbea-Oiz-XCO-Bikes-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-georg-egger-lukas-baum-speed-company-racing-Orbea-Oiz-XCO-Bikes-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-georg-egger-lukas-baum-speed-company-racing-Orbea-Oiz-XCO-Bikes-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-georg-egger-lukas-baum-speed-company-racing-Orbea-Oiz-XCO-Bikes-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-georg-egger-lukas-baum-speed-company-racing-Orbea-Oiz-XCO-Bikes-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-georg-egger-lukas-baum-speed-company-racing-Orbea-Oiz-XCO-Bikes.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Georg (left) and Lukas (right) looking fresh with their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2023-orbea-oiz-120mm-xc-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">2023 Orbea Oiz</a> Race Bikes ahead of the 27 km Prologue</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thank you to Moritz Sauer for providing the photos for this story</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Georg Egger and Lukas Baum’s 2023 Cape Epic | A Photo Story</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we dig into the ups and downs of Orbea x Leatt x Speed Company Racing’s assault on the 2023 Cape Epic, let’s just remind ourselves what the riders went through last week. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-speed-company-racing-stage-1.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-speed-company-racing-stage-1-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"2023 cape epic speed company racing stage 1\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-speed-company-racing-stage-1-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-speed-company-racing-stage-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-speed-company-racing-stage-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-speed-company-racing-stage-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-speed-company-racing-stage-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-speed-company-racing-stage-1-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-speed-company-racing-stage-1.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>South Africa seems like a nice place to race bikes, doesn’t it?</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 Route took in 648km of racing, with no fewer than 15,475 meters of elevation gained along the way.

They are also not permitted any radio support, so unless they can see the other teams in the distance, they have no way of knowing what the time difference is at any given point.

I mean, in the end we were ahead of SCOTT-SRAM</em> [Nino Schurter and Andri Frischknecht] <em>by only a few seconds, and Toyota-Specialized-NinetyOne</em> [Christopher Blevins and Mathew Beers] <em>by a few minutes. It’s not like there are hour gaps between us. Every little detail counts”</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s in contrast to the 2022 Edition of the Cape Epic, where Lukas and Georg won with a<em> relatively </em>comfortable gap of just over 3 minutes. <em>“Last year, somehow we stopped more often for refueling at feed points, even on the last two days when we were catching up the time, we stopped some time for some Coke and water, but this time it was not possible. It was so close, and it was much more tight racing” </em>– Georg Egger. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reflecting further on the 2023 race, Georg said, <em>“Guys like Nino Schurter – they know exactly how to win a race and when you have to keep pushing, even if you can’t… when we tried to open up a gap in the flat sections, they</em> [Nino and Andri] <em>would chase us back every time. It was almost impossible. And also, in the climbs… the only time we opened a gap on a climb was on the longest climb of the whole race – which was about 700 meters of climbing in one piece – then, they were at the very top when it really counted and who had the strongest legs, but over the little climbs which were only like 400 meters of elevation… it didn’t matter if you felt a bit weak or what, it was almost impossible to open a gap because the guys that are racing at the front are also mentally very strong – they destroyed themselves to the end. OK, Andri Frischknecht exploded near the end, or he could not hold the pace over the climbs on the last two days, but until then it was so hard to make a difference, almost impossible”.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-speed-company-racing-finish-2nd-overall-stage-7-finish-line-shot.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-speed-company-racing-finish-2nd-overall-stage-7-finish-line-shot-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"2023 speed company racing stage 7 finish cape epic 2nd place overall\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-speed-company-racing-finish-2nd-overall-stage-7-finish-line-shot-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-speed-company-racing-finish-2nd-overall-stage-7-finish-line-shot-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-speed-company-racing-finish-2nd-overall-stage-7-finish-line-shot-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-speed-company-racing-finish-2nd-overall-stage-7-finish-line-shot-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-speed-company-racing-finish-2nd-overall-stage-7-finish-line-shot-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-speed-company-racing-finish-2nd-overall-stage-7-finish-line-shot-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-speed-company-racing-finish-2nd-overall-stage-7-finish-line-shot.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Orbea x Leatt x Speed Company Racing are first across the line on the final stage of Cape Epic, 10 seconds ahead of Overall Winners, Chris Blevins and Matt Beers</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We asked the pair what their favorite stage was:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Georg said, “It’s kind of hard to say, just because the circumstances on some stages were miserable with the heavy rain, so maybe one of those stages would have had some nice trails you know but, to be honest at one point it was like rising against water – there was a river coming down towards us. The question was not finding the best line, it was where is the least water. It wasn’t even visible what was underneath the water”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“But for me, personally, if I had to pick one stage, around Lourensford, with the nice hand-built downhills… that was a super fun stage. Stages 5 and 6, yeah. Stage 5, the Queen Stage, the Stage we won, it was quite nice, and the final stage I also liked a lot. The final stage was like real, normal weather. It was the first day where the conditions were what we are used to riding here” – Lukas.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-mens-podium-overall-general-classification-speed-company-racing-2nd-place.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-mens-podium-overall-general-classification-speed-company-racing-2nd-place-800x1200.jpg\" alt=\"final general classification podium mens 2023 cape epic speed company racing 2nd place lukas baum georg egger\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-mens-podium-overall-general-classification-speed-company-racing-2nd-place-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-mens-podium-overall-general-classification-speed-company-racing-2nd-place-200x300.jpg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-mens-podium-overall-general-classification-speed-company-racing-2nd-place-80x120.jpg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-mens-podium-overall-general-classification-speed-company-racing-2nd-place-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-mens-podium-overall-general-classification-speed-company-racing-2nd-place-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-mens-podium-overall-general-classification-speed-company-racing-2nd-place-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-mens-podium-overall-general-classification-speed-company-racing-2nd-place.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He went on to say, <em>“This time, we had only these cross-country guys, the complete cyclists – Chris Blevins also does road cycling, and Nino also super experienced… yeah, and Matt Beers knows all the trails well – you saw that, he was quite comfortable.

I only lock it on the trails fully if the ground is even and when I don’t want to risk putting power through the suspension and losing forward momentum. Other than that, when I am sitting, I am almost always open”.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-pro-bike-check-lukas-baum-bike-adhead-seat-post-extra-setback-reduces-effective-seat-tube-angle-1.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-pro-bike-check-lukas-baum-bike-adhead-seat-post-extra-setback-reduces-effective-seat-tube-angle-1-800x1200.jpg\" alt=\"2023 cape epic lukas baum bike check bike ahead composites negative setback seat post custom\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-pro-bike-check-lukas-baum-bike-adhead-seat-post-extra-setback-reduces-effective-seat-tube-angle-1-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-pro-bike-check-lukas-baum-bike-adhead-seat-post-extra-setback-reduces-effective-seat-tube-angle-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-pro-bike-check-lukas-baum-bike-adhead-seat-post-extra-setback-reduces-effective-seat-tube-angle-1-80x120.jpg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-pro-bike-check-lukas-baum-bike-adhead-seat-post-extra-setback-reduces-effective-seat-tube-angle-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-pro-bike-check-lukas-baum-bike-adhead-seat-post-extra-setback-reduces-effective-seat-tube-angle-1-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-pro-bike-check-lukas-baum-bike-adhead-seat-post-extra-setback-reduces-effective-seat-tube-angle-1-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-cape-epic-pro-bike-check-lukas-baum-bike-adhead-seat-post-extra-setback-reduces-effective-seat-tube-angle-1.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Lukas and Georg each carried a CO2 canister and mini-tool in their jersey for quick access, with a second one stored inside a saddle bag along with an innertube and tire plugs</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The stem was not the only custom component on Lukas’ race bike;

It is probably the event that gave us the biggest boost with our new team and everything. I think without the Cape Epic we would not be where we are at the moment. Somehow that race fits us almost perfectly. We are working so good together as a team. And also, the race profile and also the fact that the race lasts for over one week… it all plays into our cards, and we can definitely perform so good in that race”</em> – Georg.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What’s next for Orbea x Leatt x Speed Company Racing?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>“We are going to do another stage race in Croatia – The Four Islands, and then we are going to switch back to Cross-Country Racing. We will try to do the Cross-Country races as good as possible for the World Cup and the National Champs, and then we will race toward the World Championships in Glasgow. We are super excited about that whole event, you know with all the disciplines. I think it is super nice for the sport. And then, towards the end of the season, we switch back to marathon again and finish off with the Epic Israel Stage Race” – Georg.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What are Lukas and Georg’s Aspirations for the 2023 World Championships in Glasgow?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Lukas said,<em> “The aspirations for the Marathon Race is higher than for the Cross-Country Race right now. I mean, last year, I really wanted to win the World Championships in Denmark because the track was suiting us so well. I am not sure how much climbing there will be in Glasgow, and how the track is going to be…”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“<em>I think we showed here that we can compete on the highest level of Marathon.
