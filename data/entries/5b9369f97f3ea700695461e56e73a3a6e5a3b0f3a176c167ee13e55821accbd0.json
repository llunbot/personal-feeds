It orbits its host star at just half the Earth-Sun distance, and by all indications, the star should have gone through a phase in which it bloated up enough to engulf that entire orbit and then some. Yet 8 Ursae Minoris b definitely appears to exist.</p>\n<p>There is a handful of potential explanations, none of them especially likely. The people who discovered the planet are suggesting that it survived because its host star got distracted by swallowing a white dwarf instead.</p>\n<h2>Big and hot</h2>\n<p>8 Ursae Minoris b was discovered using the radial velocity method, which watches for changes in a star's light that occur as planets tug the star back and forth as they orbit. This tugging creates a blue shift in the light when the planet is pulling the star in the direction of Earth and a red shift when the star is pulled away from Earth.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950655#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950655&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5b9369f97f3ea700695461e56e73a3a6e5a3b0f3a176c167ee13e55821accbd0","category":"Tech"}
