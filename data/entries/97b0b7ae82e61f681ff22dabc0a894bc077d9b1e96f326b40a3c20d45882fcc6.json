That's what <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_NX_series\">Samsung's NX cameras</a> promised.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, Samsung didn't keep that promise too much longer after it dropped its camera business and sales numbers disappeared. It tried out the quirky idea of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/08/samsung-galaxy-nx-android-camera-gets-official-prices-and-specs/\">jamming together Android phones and NX cameras</a> in 2013, providing a more direct means of sending shots and clips to Instagram or YouTube. But it shut down its Social Network Services (SNS) entirely in 2021, leaving NX owners with the choices of manually transferring their photos or ditching their cameras (presuming they had not already moved on).</p>\n<p>Some people, wonderfully, refuse to give up. People like Georg Lukas, who reverse-engineered Samsung's SNS API to <a href=\"https://op-co.de/blog/posts/samsung_nx_mastodon/#index1h3\">bring back a version of direct picture posting to Wi-Fi-enabled NX models</a>, and even expand it. It was not easy, but at least the hardware is cheap. By reflashing the surprisingly capable board on a USB 4G dongle, Lukas is able to create a Wi-Fi hotspot with LTE uplink and run his modified version of Samsung's (<a href=\"https://op-co.de/blog/posts/samsung_nx_cryptofail/\">woefully insecure</a>) service natively on the stick.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035842#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035842&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"97b0b7ae82e61f681ff22dabc0a894bc077d9b1e96f326b40a3c20d45882fcc6","category":"Tech"}
