Last week, the governor of Hawaii <a href=\"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2021/09/06/hawaii-news/medical-facilities-given-immunity-in-covid-surge/\">signed an executive order</a> releasing the state’s hospitals from liability if they turn away sick patients because they have no room.

His son survived—after what the dad described as five days in the hospital and an initial $5,000 bill.</p>\n<p>Stories of patients unable to get into hospitals—stuck in waiting rooms, lingering in ambulances, life-flighted to other states where there might be an open bed—have been an awful constant during this hot-spot summer. Overcrowding is an obvious threat to their health.
