They’re popular for good reason, as they add comfort, strength, and a touch of class to any bicycle. I’ve toured across Oregon on Ritchey bars, crashed them more than once in the same criterium and still finished, and also chose the WCS “wet red” cockpit to coordinate with a vintage Pinarello chassis – they just hit the mark for so many applications. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>New for 2025, the SuperLogic Streem Handlebar proves that Ritchey’s long-established approach to design can even be applied in the search for aero gains.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-carbon-fiber-road-bike-handlebar6-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"623\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-carbon-fiber-road-bike-handlebar6-1536x623.webp\" alt=\"Ritchey Streem carbon fiber road bike handlebar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-carbon-fiber-road-bike-handlebar6-1536x623.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-carbon-fiber-road-bike-handlebar6-297x120.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-carbon-fiber-road-bike-handlebar6-120x49.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-carbon-fiber-road-bike-handlebar6-768x311.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-carbon-fiber-road-bike-handlebar6-2048x831.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-carbon-fiber-road-bike-handlebar4-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"568\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-carbon-fiber-road-bike-handlebar4-1536x568.webp\" alt=\"Ritchey Streem carbon fiber road bike handlebar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-carbon-fiber-road-bike-handlebar4-1536x568.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-carbon-fiber-road-bike-handlebar4-297x110.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-carbon-fiber-road-bike-handlebar4-120x44.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-carbon-fiber-road-bike-handlebar4-768x284.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-carbon-fiber-road-bike-handlebar4-2048x757.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-carbon-fiber-road-bike-handlebar3-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"522\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-carbon-fiber-road-bike-handlebar3-1536x522.webp\" alt=\"Ritchey Streem carbon fiber road bike handlebar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-carbon-fiber-road-bike-handlebar3-1536x522.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-carbon-fiber-road-bike-handlebar3-297x101.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-carbon-fiber-road-bike-handlebar3-120x41.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-carbon-fiber-road-bike-handlebar3-768x261.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-carbon-fiber-road-bike-handlebar3-2048x697.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In a move that is classic Ritchey, the new SuperLogic Streem Handlebar is designed to adapt to virtually every road bike ever made, because it has, well, <em>all</em> the holes. The SuperLogic Streem will accommodate full internal cable routing from the levers to the headtube, for those fully concealed setups that are à la mode these days, or partial internal cable routing from the levers to the center section of the handlebar for most disc road bikes made prior to this decade, and bikes with rim brakes. There’s even a hole at the drops for riders running fully wired Di2 with a bar-end junction A.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RitcheyLogicStreem03.webp\"><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RitcheyLogicStreem03.webp\" alt=\"the myriad routing options on the SuperLogic Streem Handlebar\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The SuperLogic Streem Handlebar is a handsome piece of carbon fiber kit. Its minimal graphics and UD finish look equally at home on the gloriously skinny tubes of the Ritchey Logic Disc, or any of the carbon bikes used in the World Tour. Though it has an aero top section, this part of the handlebar is sized to accommodate bar tape without the risk of it splitting or unfurling. While wrapping this way may cut into the SuperLogic Streem’s aero gains a bit, the choice is there. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ritchey Superlogic Streem Specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/cf-SL-streem-spec-diagram-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/cf-SL-streem-spec-diagram-1536x1025.webp\" alt=\"Ritchey Streem handlebar spec diagram\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/cf-SL-streem-spec-diagram-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/cf-SL-streem-spec-diagram-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/cf-SL-streem-spec-diagram-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/cf-SL-streem-spec-diagram-768x513.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/cf-SL-streem-spec-diagram-2048x1367.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/cf-SL-streem-spec-diagram-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/cf-SL-streem-spec-diagram-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-handlebar-specs.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"417\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-handlebar-specs-1536x417.png\" alt=\"Ritchey Streem handlebar specs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-handlebar-specs-1536x417.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-handlebar-specs-297x81.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-handlebar-specs-120x33.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-handlebar-specs-768x208.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ritchey-Streem-handlebar-specs.png 1606w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br />While some aero road bars have lost the plot on ergonomics and aesthetics in the name of marginal aero gains, Ritchey has saved a gazillion watts of collective drag with a simple choice, making the widest option for the new SuperLogic Streem Handlebar 40cm at the hoods, with 38cm and 36cm also on offer for even more aggressive aero cockpit setups. It’s about time narrower bars, or rather a purging of overly wide bars, became the trend for road bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very few riders have shoulders wide enough for 44cm bars, and while some may lament the lack of a 42cm option here, those riders probably are not looking for their handlebar to save watts of drag at 40kph. Along with the narrow hood width of the SuperLogic Streem comes an aggressive drop flare of 10 degrees, which will preserve descending confidence and sprinting leverage.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RitcheySuperLogicStreem3.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1608\" height=\"673\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RitcheySuperLogicStreem3.webp\" alt=\"a face-on view of the SuperLogic Streem Handlebar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RitcheySuperLogicStreem3.webp 1608w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RitcheySuperLogicStreem3-297x124.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RitcheySuperLogicStreem3-1536x643.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RitcheySuperLogicStreem3-120x50.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RitcheySuperLogicStreem3-768x321.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br />The SuperLogic Streem’s shaping is about more than getting super narrow and throwing down. The top, that place where we chill when climbing, eating, or snapping a photo, is swept back at a 5-degree angle, promoting healthy wrist posture and a more secure grip. Some aero road bars have this backward – the tops actually have a negative sweep, away from the rider. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know from experience that this shape is less comfortable and less practical, but I’m dubious that it makes a bike more aero. Aside from the narrow hood width and aggressive flare, the rest of the SuperLogic Streem specs are classic road – with a reach of 77mm and a drop of 120mm. While many road bars have gone to a shorter reach, like 70mm, the SuperLogic Streem’s more traditional reach of 77mm should all or for a more forward, stretched out, and aero position in the hoods.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RitcheySuperLogicStreem2-1.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"975\" height=\"701\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RitcheySuperLogicStreem2-1.webp\" alt=\"A top-down view of the SuperLogic Streem Handlebar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RitcheySuperLogicStreem2-1.webp 975w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RitcheySuperLogicStreem2-1-297x214.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RitcheySuperLogicStreem2-1-120x86.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RitcheySuperLogicStreem2-1-768x552.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Priced at $299.95, the Streem bars are available globally at Ritchey’s website, local retailers, and online shops. <br /><a href=\"https://ritcheylogic.com\">ritcheylogic.com<br /></a><br /></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ritchey-superlogic-streem-carbon-handlebar/\">Ritchey SuperLogic Streem Aero Handlebar Bridges the Gap to Modern Bike Fit</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Bennett Shane","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"541e1ecea24fc7adfe3d69de1b7829c67c0c3ed0ec239fd8dcbb479aa4757eb1","category":"Cycling"}
