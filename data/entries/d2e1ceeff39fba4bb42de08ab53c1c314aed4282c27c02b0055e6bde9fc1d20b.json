In comparison, Apple's native Camera app is limited to recording spatial video in 1080p at 30fps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nShortly after Apple's Vision Pro headset launched in February in the United States, Apple released iOS 17.2, which brought the new spatial video recording format to iPhone 15 Pro models. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen viewed on iPhone, spatial video appear as normal videos, but viewed on Vision Pro they provide an immersive viewing experience on Vision Pro that is almost three-dimensional. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nCombined with advanced computational videography techniques and HEVC compression, spatial videos filmed at 30fps in 1080p take up around 130MB of storage space for one minute of video, so bear that in mind when shooting using Spatialify's higher resolution options, which will take up substantially more storage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSpatialify first made headlines back in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/15/spatial-video-iphone-15-vr-headset/\">November</a>, before Apple Vision Pro had been launched, when a TestFlight version of the app became available. This allowed iPhone 15 Pro users running the iOS 17.2 beta to record spatial video in a format that could be played back on Meta Quest 3 and other 3D headsets and TVs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSpatialify is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/spatialify/id6471922894\">available to download on the App Store</a>. The app costs $3 and requires an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max to shoot spatial video.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spatial-video/\">spatial video</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Neutral)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/29/spatialify-iphone-app-better-quality-spatial-video/\">$3 App Shoots Better Quality Spatial Video Than iPhone's Camera App</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/3-app-shoots-better-quality-spatial-video-than-iphones-camera-app.2423083/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d2e1ceeff39fba4bb42de08ab53c1c314aed4282c27c02b0055e6bde9fc1d20b","category":"Apple"}
