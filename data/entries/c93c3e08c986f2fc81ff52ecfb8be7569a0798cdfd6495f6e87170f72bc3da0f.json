The Company posted quarterly \nrevenue of $89.5 billion, down 1 percent year over year, and \nquarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.46, up 13 percent year \nover year. </p>\n\n<p>“Today Apple is pleased to report a September quarter revenue \nrecord for iPhone and an all-time revenue record in Services,” \nsaid Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/fy2023-q4/FY23_Q4_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf\">Apple’s financial statement</a> (PDF, figures are in millions of dollars):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/10/aapl-q4-2023-net-sales-shadow.png\">\n<img src=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/10/aapl-q4-2023-net-sales-shadow.png\" width=\"525\" alt=\"Screenshot of the table for net sales from Apple's financial report for the quarter.\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Mac sales are down quite a bit year over year, both on a quarterly basis and trailing 12-month period, but I don’t think that’s a reflection on the Mac platform. Rather, it’s the whole PC market, which is now in a downswing after a huge surge during and after COVID.</p>\n\n<p>Services, at $22.3 billion, is now just over half the net sales for iPhone ($43.8 billion). And Mac + iPad + Wearables/etc. combine for $23.3 billion, so Services seems on the cusp of soon eclipsing all non-iPhone hardware combined.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/02/apple-q4-2023-results\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c93c3e08c986f2fc81ff52ecfb8be7569a0798cdfd6495f6e87170f72bc3da0f","category":"Tech"}
