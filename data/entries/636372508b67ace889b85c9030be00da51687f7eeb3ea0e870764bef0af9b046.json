The decision to release ‌its iPad software until later in the fall was to allow it more time to refine ‌Stage Manager‌, its then-new app window management system, which was subject to much criticism in the beta development phase. ‌\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17‌ and ‌iPadOS 17‌ will likely appear shortly after the iPhone 15 series is announced during Apple's \"Wonderlust\" event on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/\">Tuesday, September 12</a>.
