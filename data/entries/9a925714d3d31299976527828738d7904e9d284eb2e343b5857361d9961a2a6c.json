This is unusual, since similar insects are known to form more energy-efficient droplets of urine instead of jets. Adult cicadas have even been known to spray intruders with their anal jets—a thought that will certainly be with us when <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-double-brood-of-periodical-cicadas-will-emerge-in-2024/#:~:text=Now%20that%20the%20insects%20have,long%20breeding%20binge%20before%20death.\">\"double brood\" cicada season</a> begins in earnest this spring.</p>\n<p>The science community has shown a lot of interest in the fluid dynamics of sucking insects but not as much in how they eliminate waste, according to Georgia Tech's Saad Bhamla (although Leonardo da Vinci was fascinated by jet behavior and the role of fluid cohesion in drop formation). Yet, this is a critical function for any organism's ecological and metabolic regulation. So Bhamla's research has focused on addressing that shortcoming and challenging what he believes are outdated mammal-centric paradigms that supposedly govern waste elimination in various creatures.</p>\n<p>For instance, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/02/watch-these-glassy-winged-sharpshooters-fling-pee-bubbles-with-anal-catapult/\">last year,</a> his team studied urination in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glassy-winged_sharpshooter\">glassy-winged sharpshooter</a>. The sharpshooter drinks huge amounts of water, piercing a plant's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylem\">xylem</a> (which transports water from the roots to stems and leaves) to suck out the sap. So sharpshooters pee frequently, expelling as much as 300 times their own body weight in urine every day. Rather than producing a steady stream of urine, sharpshooters form drops of urine at the anus and then catapult those drops away from their bodies at remarkable speeds, boasting accelerations 10 times faster than a Lamborghini.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009512#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009512&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9a925714d3d31299976527828738d7904e9d284eb2e343b5857361d9961a2a6c","category":"Tech"}
