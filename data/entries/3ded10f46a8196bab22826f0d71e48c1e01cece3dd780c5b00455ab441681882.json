We’re hoping the newly designed rims and fast-engaging hubs are worth the outlay.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr</i></span></div>\n<p><span>In the UK, at least, it’s fair to say when you think of wheel brands Reynolds isn’t the first name that comes to mind. </span></p>\n<p><span>S</span><span>till, Reynolds has been quietly supporting the Pivot Factory Racing team and putting riders such as Bernard Kerr on the downhill world cup podium and Morgane Charre second overall in last year’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/beginners-guide-to-enduro-racing/\">Enduro World Series</a> (now the Enduro World Cup). So, the brand must be doing something right.  </span><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>These new Reynolds 329 Trail Pro wheels are the brand’s top-end trail wheels. They use Reynolds’ asymmetric, hookless MR5 IDM TSS carbon fibre rims with a wider-than-usual 32mm internal rim width and shallow 19mm rim depth.  </span><span> </span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Will the newly designed rim with its 32mm inner width, 19mm depth and tuned carbon layup deliver on the trails?</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr</i></span></div>\n<p><span>The Impact Dispersing Matrix (IDM) technology and MR5 layup process are created explicitly for speed, durability and comfort, claims Reynolds. In addition, the TTS inner rim channel works for wider tyres to keep them seated on the rims while running lower <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/trail-tech-mountain-bike-tyre-pressure-all-you-need-to-know/\">tyre pressures</a>. </span><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>The Pro version has 28 Sapim CX-Ray spokes laced to Industry Nine Hydra hubs with their near-instant 0.52-degree freehub engagement. These wheels weigh a competitive 1,583g, so they tick many boxes. Maybe all but the price.</span><span> </span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Reynolds is using Industry Nine’s Hydra hub with its fast 0.52-degree freehub engagement to complement the high-spec wheels.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr</i></span></div>\n<p><span>In the past, Reynolds’ wheels have had a reputation for stiffness, so I’m keen to see how this latest model stacks up with its new design.  </span><span> </span></p>\n<ul><li><span><strong>Reynolds Blacklabel 329 Trail Pro:</strong> £2,200 </span><span> </span></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n\n<h2><span>DMR ODUB handlebar </span><span> </span></h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This Olly Wilkins signature bar from DMR should provide mountain bikers of all disciplines with a capable alloy bar to meet their needs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media / Luke Marshall</i></span></div>\n<p>This should be right up the street of DMR fans and Olly Wilkins supporters. The ODUB is Wilkins’ signature bar, made possible after 20 years with DMR and a decade of product design.</p>\n<p>If you’re a mountain biker who prefers functionality over exotic tech, it might be worth a look too. This alloy handlebar uses a 7075 heat-treated spiral butted aluminium construction to balance weight and strength.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> All the details are printed on the bar, giving you the shape, width and rise.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media / Luke Marshall</i></span></div>\n<p>For the all-important shape, Wilkins designed the bar to have a common 8-degree backsweep and 5-degree upsweep to provide a form that will cover a wide range of riding, from <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/dirt-jump-bikes/\">dirt jump bikes</a> to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">electric bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s available in 31.8mm and 35mm clamp diameters, with 20mm, 35mm and 50mm rises to cover all riding needs. The 35mm clamp bars come in 800mm widths, while the 31.8mm clamp bars are 780mm.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bars come with clearly visible width markers so you can cut them down to your preferred length.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media / Luke Marshall</i></span></div>\n<p>An interesting feature is the bar comes without packaging to save throwaway material, and the barcode is printed on the product.</p>\n<p>Suppose you’re cautious about clamping a carbon handlebar with stems and brakes, or damaging it in a crash.

If, after a winter of slop, you’re fed up with getting a wet backside every time you go out, this rear fender from MuckyNutz might be a saving grace to get you through spring.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The mounts for the guard use rubber inserts in the plastic to help protect your frame.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media / Luke Marshall</i></span></div>\n<p>The MugGuard Rear has several neat features. Using reusable Velcro straps, the guard is attached to the frame by rubber base mounts to protect your bike’s paint. In addition, you can customise the tyre clearance with the innovative dial feature to set the guard up optimally for any frame shape.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The MugGuard Rear’s adjustment system enables you to tailor the angle of the guard to make sure you get the best possible fit for your bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media / Luke Marshall</i></span></div>\n<p>You can keep the guard short or attach the extension for full coverage when the conditions are at their grottiest. There’s also an integrated guard to protect your shock from mud and grit.</p>\n<p>The fender has been made from 100 per cent recycled plastic bottles rather than virgin plastic. If you can see past the looks of a rear fender, the MugGuard should be a quality piece of kit.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> If you don’t need to run the extender, you can use the MugGuard Rear in its standard shorter length.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media / Luke Marshall</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Mucky Nutz MugGuard Rear:</strong> £38</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2><span>Oladance Wearable Stereo earphones</span></h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The earphones sit away from your ears, so you can still hear the world around you. They’re ideal for cycling through busy streets.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media / Luke Marshall</i></span></div>\n<p>Earphones are not a product that comes across our desks too often and we don’t recommend <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/6-reasons-you-shouldnt-ride-with-headphones/\">riding while wearing traditional in-ear headphones</a>. However, these Oladance Wearable Stereos might be a terrific addition to a cyclist’s outfit.</p>\n<p>What makes these different is the earbud sits outside the ear. The design is claimed to improve comfort because you don’t have to insert earbuds inside your outer ear. Instead, these rest over the tops of your ears.</p>\n<p>That open-ear feature still enables you to hear the world around you, much like bone-conducting headphones. However, unlike bone-conducting headphones, no vibrations pass through your head, which apparently can cause discomfort and headaches over time.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> By hooking over the top of your ears, the Oladance Wearable Stereos are intended to offer maximum comfort and security while in use.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media / Luke Marshall</i></span></div>\n<p>I’m interested to see how these stack up in the real world. As for the specs, they use 16.5mm drivers and connect to devices via Bluetooth to control music, calls, volume and phone-native voice control. In addition, they have a claimed 16-hour battery life and charge in two hours via a USB-C case.</p>\n<p>They benefit from skin-friendly silicone and have an IPX4 splash-proof rating. For those riders who enjoy a BikeRadar podcast on the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cycling-to-work-guide/\">commute to work</a> or a solo ride, these might be a great option to maximise comfort while keeping you aware of the world outside.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Oladance Wearable Stereo:</strong> $179.99 USD (+ shipping)</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>","author":"Luke Marshall","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"3ded10f46a8196bab22826f0d71e48c1e01cece3dd780c5b00455ab441681882","category":"Cycling"}
