According to Apple’s release notes, it specifically squashed two major bugs with the Apple Watch Series 3:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>• Software update progress may not be displayed accurately for some Apple Watch Series 3 users</p><p>• Accessibility settings may not have been available for some Apple Watch Series 3 users</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Of note, the update does not include any security updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To update your Apple Watch, you’ll need an iPhone running iOS 15 and your Apple Watch charger. Once your Apple Watch is connected to the charging puck, head over to the Watch app on your iPhone, tap <em>My Watch</em>, then <em>General</em>, and <em>Software Update</em>. Then tap <em>Download and install</em> and follow the prompts. You can also update directly on your Apple Watch as well by going to the Settings app, then <em>General</em> and <em>Software Update</em>.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"fb9af73553cba8c763a2cde065fb65f5da3d6a346a537c494781417d34b4051d","category":"Apple"}
