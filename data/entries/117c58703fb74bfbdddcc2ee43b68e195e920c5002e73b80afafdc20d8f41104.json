In his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-30/apple-iphone-15-pro-features-usb-c-port-new-design-thinner-bezels-lkpemg29\"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, Gurman said the Apple Watch SE will remain on a two-year upgrade cycle, so the third-generation model can be expected to be released in September 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-se-2022.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThis means that the second-generation Apple Watch SE should remain a safe buy for customers considering purchasing one, as the device is not expected to be upgraded for over a year still and has plenty of time remaining in its lifecycle.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPrevious generations of the Apple Watch SE launched in September 2020 and September 2022, as outlined in the <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE\">MacRumors Buyer's Guide</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPriced starting at $249, the Apple Watch SE is the most affordable Apple Watch, but it lacks some features available on higher-end Apple Watch models, including the ECG app, Blood Oxygen app, an always-on display, and wrist temperature tracking. It also has thicker bezels and smaller case size options compared to the Apple Watch Series 7 and newer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNew models launching this year will include the Apple Watch Series 9 in two sizes, and a second-generation Apple Watch Ultra, according to Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman also revealed that Apple tested a dark titanium color option for the Apple Watch Ultra last year, but decided against releasing it.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE\">Apple Watch SE (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/30/no-apple-watch-se-3-expected-this-year/\">Apple Watch SE 3: New Model Not Expected to Launch Until Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-se-3-new-model-not-expected-to-launch-until-next-year.2397301/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"117c58703fb74bfbdddcc2ee43b68e195e920c5002e73b80afafdc20d8f41104","category":"Apple"}
