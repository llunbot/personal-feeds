The video was later linked to on social media platform X <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1843042812599972303\">by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Alleged-M4-MacBook-Pro-Leak-Video.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"895\" />\r<br />\nIt is possible that this is the same MacBook Pro box shown in photos that were <a href=\"https://x.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1840807198223712347\">shared by leaker ShrimpApplePro</a> in late September, as he claimed that this MacBook Pro unit was apparently being sold in a private Facebook group at the time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile we cannot confirm the authenticity of this leak, the box reveals four potential upgrades for what seems to be the base model 14-inch MacBook Pro:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li><strong>25% faster M4 chip:</strong> The box lists this 14-inch MacBook Pro as having an M4 chip with a 10-core CPU, whereas the current model has the M3 chip with an 8-core CPU. An <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/8171874\">alleged Geekbench 6 benchmark result</a> shared by the YouTube channel behind this leak suggests that the M4 chip will be up to 25% faster than the M3 chip. Apple already introduced the M4 chip in the iPad Pro in May, and it indeed has up to a 10-core CPU and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/m4-ipad-pro-cpu-benchmark/\">up to 25% faster performance</a> compared to the M3 chip.\r<br />\n</li><li><strong>16GB of RAM:</strong> It was previously rumored that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-new-macs-16gb-ram-standard/\">16GB of RAM could become the minimum</a> for all future Macs, and the alleged packaging indeed suggests that the next 14-inch MacBook Pro would start with 16GB of RAM, unless it is somehow a built-to-order configuration that will be offered on Apple's online store.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Three Thunderbolt 4 ports:</strong> The box suggests the base 14-inch MacBook Pro will have three Thunderbolt 4 ports, up from two Thunderbolt 3 ports on the current model.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Space Black:</strong> The box suggests that Space Black would become a color option for the base 14-inch MacBook Pro, whereas it is currently exclusive to models configured with the M3 Pro or M3 Max chip.</li></ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is a screenshot of the box from the video:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Alleged-M4-MacBook-Pro-Leak-Box.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"897\" />\r<br />\nGurman today said he expects Apple to announce the first Macs with M4 chips in late October, and release at least some of them <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/apple-to-launch-new-m4-macs-nov-1/\">on Friday, November 1</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is the video, which could be removed from YouTube at any point:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 14 &amp; 16\" </a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/alleged-m4-macbook-pro-unboxing-video/\">Alleged M4 MacBook Pro Unboxing Video Reveals These Four Upgrades</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/alleged-m4-macbook-pro-unboxing-video-reveals-these-four-upgrades.2439383/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9e9918eae8cbd7e2ca33fcab7f432dd5edb5307c2c13c120753c5734f2f9843e","category":"Apple"}
