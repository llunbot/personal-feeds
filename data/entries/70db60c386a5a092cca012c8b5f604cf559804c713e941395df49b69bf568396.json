Executing code can introduce or changes features or functionality of the app and allows for downloading of content without licensing.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPlease note that while educational apps designed to teach, develop, or allow students to test executable code may, in limited circumstances, download code, such code may not be used for other purposes and such apps must make the source code completely viewable and editable by the user.</blockquote>Apple's ‌App Store‌ team has given Li 14 days to submit an update removing the offending functionality, or the app will be removed from the ‌App Store‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\niDOS 2 has been available in the ‌App Store‌ since 2014, and its predecessor, iDOS, was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2010/10/26/idos-emulator-supports-dos-and-windows-3-0-on-ios-devices/\">first released</a> in 2010. iDOS has had issues with Apple before, and in 2010, Apple pulled the original emulator app from the ‌App Store‌. Changes were made, and the app was allowed back in the ‌App Store‌ in 2011, but there have still been ongoing troubles with Apple.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\niDOS 2 went four years without an update because of Apple's restrictions on iTunes file sharing and bundling game files without ownership, but in 2020, Li implemented document storage and was able to once again update the app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSince 2020, iDOS has been able to run games and programs accessed through file sharing, which Apple now says is not allowed. Li says that he never aimed to trick or fool reviewers, and instead made it clear with each update how the app worked.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLi says that he is not going to cut the critical functions of the iDOS 2 app to comply with Apple's ‌App Store‌ rules, because it would be a betrayal of users who purchased the app for those features.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\niDOS 2 is still <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/idos-2/id918131840\">available for purchase</a> at the current time, but Apple may soon be pulling it from the ‌App Store‌.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/22/apple-to-pill-idos-2-emulator-from-app-store/\">Apple to Pull 'iDOS 2' DOS Emulator From App Store</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-pull-idos-2-dos-emulator-from-app-store.2305140/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Numq1ojHTaU:tDyA-Nkicdw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Numq1ojHTaU:tDyA-Nkicdw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Numq1ojHTaU\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"70db60c386a5a092cca012c8b5f604cf559804c713e941395df49b69bf568396","category":"Apple"}
