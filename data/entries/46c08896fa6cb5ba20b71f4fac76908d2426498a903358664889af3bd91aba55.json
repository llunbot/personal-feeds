Seems like just yesterday we were learning about smart trainers and this new video-game-like training program called Zwift. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In those 10 years, there have been a LOT of users logging a LOT of miles on Zwift – more than 8 <em>billion</em> kilometers ridden or run, with over 81 billion meters of climbing. Over that time 15 future pro cyclists have been discovered, with more to come. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Watopia Expansion!</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/550077-tsoz-fall_08-2024_garage-pr-slide-10-Watopia-Expansion-280f5e-original-1724419744-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/550077-tsoz-fall_08-2024_garage-pr-slide-10-Watopia-Expansion-280f5e-original-1724419744-1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Zwift Watopia Expansion\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/550077-tsoz-fall_08-2024_garage-pr-slide-10-Watopia-Expansion-280f5e-original-1724419744-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/550077-tsoz-fall_08-2024_garage-pr-slide-10-Watopia-Expansion-280f5e-original-1724419744-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/550077-tsoz-fall_08-2024_garage-pr-slide-10-Watopia-Expansion-280f5e-original-1724419744-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/550077-tsoz-fall_08-2024_garage-pr-slide-10-Watopia-Expansion-280f5e-original-1724419744-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/550077-tsoz-fall_08-2024_garage-pr-slide-10-Watopia-Expansion-280f5e-original-1724419744-1200x675.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/550077-tsoz-fall_08-2024_garage-pr-slide-10-Watopia-Expansion-280f5e-original-1724419744-jpg.webp 1920w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you love Zwift, you probably love Watopia. Zwift’s beloved world was its first, and the home of the most popular route of all time: Tempus Fugit. Now, it’s about to get even bigger. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From now until Stage 5 of the Tour of Watopia on November 24th, you might notice something rising from the ocean, just off the coast of Watopia. The teaser makes them look like some kind of ancient Stonehenge-like structure, but only time will tell!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Updated Heads Up Display</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/550084-tsoz-fall_08-2024_slide-12-hub-refresh-a3e507-original-1724419764-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/550084-tsoz-fall_08-2024_slide-12-hub-refresh-a3e507-original-1724419764-1536x864.webp\" alt=\"New Zwift HUD\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/550084-tsoz-fall_08-2024_slide-12-hub-refresh-a3e507-original-1724419764-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/550084-tsoz-fall_08-2024_slide-12-hub-refresh-a3e507-original-1724419764-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/550084-tsoz-fall_08-2024_slide-12-hub-refresh-a3e507-original-1724419764-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/550084-tsoz-fall_08-2024_slide-12-hub-refresh-a3e507-original-1724419764-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/550084-tsoz-fall_08-2024_slide-12-hub-refresh-a3e507-original-1724419764-1200x675.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/550084-tsoz-fall_08-2024_slide-12-hub-refresh-a3e507-original-1724419764-jpg.webp 1920w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Following community feedback, the updated Heads Up Display (HUD) now will allow for customizable metrics including cadence, heart rate, average watts, and w/kg.

Wahoo KICKR Run owners will also see the new Dynamic Elevation display when utilizing Incline Control.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Challenges and Rewards</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting September 9th, riders will have some optional new challenges including the Cardio Crusher and Route Chaser. These can be accessed via the Challenges section on the Home Screen and can be completed alongside one additional ‘main’ challenge – Everest, Italy, or California.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cardio Crusher – Sept 9</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Catering to a wide range of fitness goals and for time-crunched athletes, the Cardio Crusher Challenge offers five new workouts, all under an hour. Zwifters who complete all five workouts will unlock 250 XP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Route Chaser: The Grade – Oct 3</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideal for users looking for a Challenge to earn new badges. Zwifters must complete five routes to complete the challenge, three of which are new – Mayan 8 (23.1km with 241m elevation gain), Radio Rendezvous (20.5km with 736m elevation gain), and Power to the Tower (44.7km with 1492m elevation gain).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Zwift Racing Score</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Zwift claims the new Zwift Racing Score (ZRS?) will revolutionize racing on Zwift making sure you’re in the right category from the start.
