The Dutch race will move from the 17th to the 10th of April while the cobbles await the riders in northern France on the Amstel Gold Race’s original April 17th date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paris-Roubaix was looking for a new date with the French presidential elections on April 10th. Thankfully, the Amstel Gold Race organisers stepped in to help by moving their event one week forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Christian Prudhomme called me that the race couldn’t be on the tenth of April due to the elections and if we could switch dates,” Amstel Gold Race director Leo van Vliet said. “We talked with all parties involved and decided to do so in these special circumstances. It’s great we can help each other in this way.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ASO director Christian Prudhomme echoed this sentiment. “This solution is possible thanks to the cooperation and positive attitude of Leo and the UCI. On behalf of thousands of cycling fans, we thank them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the women’s and men’s Amstel Gold Race are now the week after the Tour of Flanders. Brabantse Pijl for men and women is on Wednesday with both Paris-Roubaix races on Easter Sunday 17 April.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/paris-roubaix-and-amstel-gold-race-swap-dates-for-2022/\">Read More</a>","author":"José Been","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"2f71fb7319c7816e4245db54f6f90dc2e2e727799a3ec4ef40856d4f6a018856","category":"Cycling"}
