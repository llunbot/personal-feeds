No other information was provided on the issues Apple is having.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman has been reporting on Apple's plan to bring blood pressure monitoring since <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/10/no-body-temperature-in-apple-watch-series-8/\">January 2022</a>. In a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-01/apple-plans-hypertension-sleep-apnea-detection-for-next-watch\">November 2023 report</a>, he said that the initial version wouldn't show a user their exact systolic and diastolic measurements, but Apple was working on a follow-up version for later that could do so. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt the time, Gurman said the feature was on the cards for the Apple Watch Series 10, but that didn't happen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMore recently, Gurman has said the feature would track whether a user's blood pressure is trending upwards and send an alert if hypertension is detected. After receiving an alert, the Apple Watch user could provide the information to a medical professional for additional testing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHypertension is known as a silent killer because it can go undetected and undiagnosed, leading to heart damage and death. High blood pressure often has few symptoms until it is notably advanced, and early detection via the Apple Watch has the potential to save lives.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs recently as last December, Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/10/apple-watch-blood-pressure-monitoring-2025/\">claimed</a> that Apple was \"ramping up\" work on blood-pressure tracking and that the feature could arrive as soon as 2025. But going on his latest comments, even that now sounds unlikely.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch 10</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/apple-watch-blood-pressure-feature-snags/\">Apple Watch Blood Pressure Feature Hits More Snags in Apple's Testing</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-blood-pressure-feature-hits-more-snags-in-apples-testing.2453941/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"13699ea42786d115ac9b64dcc0a88208899b28bc018d937da88a991905fc0974","category":"Apple"}
