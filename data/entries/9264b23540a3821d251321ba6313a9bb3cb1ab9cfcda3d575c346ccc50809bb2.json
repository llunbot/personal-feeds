The added verification is meant to cut down on scams and reduce misinformation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/telegram-extra-verification.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1772\" height=\"997\" />\r<br />\nWhile Telegram already has a verification process for public figures and organizations, trusted third-party services will be able to provide additional verification options. A chat or account that has a third-party verification will be marked with a small logo before their name, and opening the associated profile will show a more detailed explanation of the account's status and what it means.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThird-party verification is separate from the verified checkmarks that Telegram provides to public figures and organizations. A service that wants to provide third-party verification to others must first be verified by Telegram and must complete an application.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to Telegram, third-party verification will make it easier for users to independently confirm the people they contact and services they interact with.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlong with the new verification option, Telegram added support for collectible gifts, reactions for service messages, extra message search filters, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTelegram says that its first major update of 2025 was actually supposed to come in on the last day of 2024, but it was \"sadly delayed by a lack of attention from Apple's review team.\"<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/telegram/\">Telegram</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/02/telegram-third-party-verification/\">Telegram Adds New Verification Option to Cut Down on Scams</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/telegram-adds-new-verification-option-to-cut-down-on-scams.2446598/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9264b23540a3821d251321ba6313a9bb3cb1ab9cfcda3d575c346ccc50809bb2","category":"Apple"}
