His outspoken love for the bicycle isn’t just lip service either; he is a longtime bike commuter and recreational rider. </span></p>\n<p><span>So it makes sense that he showed up to the Met Gala with a bicycle, right?

Most recently, in the trailer for A24’s re-release of the classic Talking Heads concert documentary </span><i><span>Stop Making Sense</span></i><span>, Byrne picks up his characteristic ‘big suit’ from the dry cleaner and rides a bicycle to the theater, suit in tow.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Love this.</p>\n<p>DAVID BYRNE <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/StopMakingSense2023?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#StopMakingSense2023</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://t.co/Vd0yOYn3l1\">pic.twitter.com/Vd0yOYn3l1</a></p>\n<p>— Michael Warburton (@MichaelWarbur17) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelWarbur17/status/1652297340055691267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 29, 2023</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/david-byrne-met-gala-2023-with-budnitz-titanium-bike-valet.jpeg?width=730\" alt width=\"980\" height=\"653\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/david-byrne-met-gala-2023-with-budnitz-titanium-bike-valet.jpeg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/david-byrne-met-gala-2023-with-budnitz-titanium-bike-valet.jpeg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption>A vehicle placard that fits neatly in his Wald basket.

The theme itself led to some controversy around the late Lagerfield’s comments about the #MeToo movement and other things. Byrne’s insistence on not only bringing his bike but adding a vehicle placard to the bike’s basket brought a bit of levity to the evening. </span></p>\n<p><span>Oh, and what was Byrne’s bike of choice? Sadly, nobody at </span><i><span>CyclingTips</span></i><span> was there to ask him for a bike check. But based on photos, it looks like a Budnitz titanium commuter bike. The bike features a Brooks saddle, a Gates belt drive, an adjustable Wald basket, and a set of well-used Schwalbe Little Big Ben tires.</span></p>\n<figure></figure>\n<figure>\n<figure>\n<p></p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/david-byrne-met-gala-2023-with-budnitz-titanium-bike.jpeg?width=730\" alt=\"david byrne met gala 2023 with budnitz titanium bike\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/david-byrne-met-gala-2023-with-budnitz-titanium-bike.jpeg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/david-byrne-met-gala-2023-with-budnitz-titanium-bike.jpeg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption>A closer look at the Budnitz David Byrne rode to the gala.
