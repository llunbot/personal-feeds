As reported by <em><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/instagrams-creator-subscriptions-nearing-launch-app-store-listing-reveals/\">TechCrunch</a></em>, Instagram's ‚ÄåApp Store‚Äå listing has recently gained new in-app subscriptions, as first spotted by Sensor Tower. The new in-app purchases are listed as \"Instagram Subscriptions\" for $0.99 and $4.99. Previously, Instagram had only listed Instagram Badge as an in-app purchase. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/instagram-subscriptions.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn practice, the new subscription would let users pay their favorite creators for exclusive content not seen by non-paying users. According to screenshots shared by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, a subscription will include a \"Member Badge,\" which gifts subscribers a \"special badge\" next to their username, and \"Exclusive content.\" \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Instagram?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Instagram</a> continues to work on the Fan Club feature üëÄ<br /><br />Here's the fan onboarding screen üëáüèª <a href=\"https://t.co/iaSWS5UyT0\">pic.twitter.com/iaSWS5UyT0</a></p>‚Äî Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1430837084189822976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 26, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nSubscriptions are just one of the multiple features Instagram has in the pipeline to expand monetization opportunities for creators on the platform.
