Stability is best known for its pioneering but highly controversial <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-stable-diffusion-you-may-never-believe-what-you-see-online-again/\">Stable Diffusion</a> series of AI image-synthesis models, first launched in 2022, which can generate images based on text descriptions.</p>\n\n<p>\"I’ve spent my career seeking out emerging technologies that push the very boundaries of what’s possible, all in the service of telling incredible stories,\" said Cameron in a statement. \"I was at the forefront of CGI over three decades ago, and I’ve stayed on the cutting edge since. Now, the intersection of generative AI and CGI image creation is the next wave.\"</p>\n<p>Cameron is perhaps best known as the director behind blockbusters like <em>Avatar</em>, <em>Titanic</em>, and <em>Aliens</em>, but in AI circles, he may be most relevant for the co-creation of the character <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)\">Skynet</a>, a fictional AI system that triggers nuclear Armageddon and dominates humanity in the <em>Terminator</em> media franchise. Similar fears of AI <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-checked-to-see-whether-gpt-4-could-take-over-the-world/\">taking over the world</a> have since jumped into reality and recently sparked attempts to regulate existential risk from AI systems through measures like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/08/as-contentious-california-ai-safety-bill-passes-critics-push-governor-for-veto/\">SB-1047</a> in California.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052114#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052114&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f08867bce0f38af539179bad8e3f62056a582b5e98dc9a744b6d044ffe228ca0","category":"Tech"}
