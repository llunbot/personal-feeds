By comparison, the report claims 295,000 counterfeits with a retail value of $61.7 million were seized at the U.S. border in the entire 2020 fiscal year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nU.S. Customs told <em>The Information</em> that 80% of all counterfeit products coming into the U.S. were from mainland China or Hong Kong.
