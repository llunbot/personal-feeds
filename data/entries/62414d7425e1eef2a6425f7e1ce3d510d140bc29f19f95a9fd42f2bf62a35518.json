But Fulcrum says they’re not just for gravel, instead designing the Sharqs in their Red Room R&amp;D Lab to make all road riding faster – from tarmac to dirt. Not the first to turn to biomimicry inspiration to optimize wheel aerodynamics, the Fulcrum Sharq takes a bite out of the wind with a unique 3-dimensional wavy sharktooth design.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fulcrum Sharq aero carbon road &amp; gravel race wheels</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wavvy wheels already stand out from the crowd, but these new Fulcrum Sharq take it to the next level with what they call their “2-Wave” design. Instead of just varying the depth of the centerline of the rim like we’ve seen from other wheelbuilders, these wheels feature a much more complex shape to cut through the wind.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fulcrum Sharq aero wheels – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fulcrum-Sharq-aero-carbon-road-bike-and-gravel-race-wheelset.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fulcrum-Sharq-aero-carbon-road-bike-and-gravel-race-wheelset.jpg\" alt=\"2025 Fulcrum Sharq aero carbon road bike and gravel race wheelset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fulcrum-Sharq-aero-carbon-road-bike-and-gravel-race-wheelset.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fulcrum-Sharq-aero-carbon-road-bike-and-gravel-race-wheelset-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fulcrum-Sharq-aero-carbon-road-bike-and-gravel-race-wheelset-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fulcrum-Sharq-aero-carbon-road-bike-and-gravel-race-wheelset-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fulcrum-Sharq-aero-carbon-road-bike-and-gravel-race-wheelset-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fulcrum’s all-new carbon Sharq aero wheels sell for $2807 / 2460€, and are available now.
