And for good reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB02561-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB02561-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB02561-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB02561-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB02561-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB02561-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB02561-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB02561-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB02561-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB02561-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB02561-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘As aerodynamic differences are narrow between the top aerodynamic wheels in the market, the performance focus for wheels has now turned toward reducing system weight in wheelsets,’ says Vision’s Ron Correa, who heads up the brand’s aero research and is also a senior designer in product development. ‘This has never been more apparent than the past few years where wheelsets on the market are being equipped with carbon spokes and minimised hubs, to drop a significant amount of weight from the overall wheel system.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is a 108g saving over steel spokes, and not only that but the carbon spokes offer increased torsional stiffness for improved acceleration and pedalling efficiency (and Vision has the data to back that up), are fitted in a 2:1 pattern for better balanced tension, and Vision’s testing found the new spokes with their aero design led to a decrease in drag when compared to the Metron SL’s steel spoke system. Its in-depth wind-tunnel testing at the most accurate tunnel in the USA showed that the Metron 45 RS are 9% faster than the SL equivalent, and the 60 RS are 6% faster than the SL equivalent.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Run-13-1-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Run-13-1-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Run-13-1-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Run-13-1-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Run-13-1-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Run-13-1-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Run-13-1-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Run-13-1-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Run-13-1-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Run-13-1-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Run-13-1-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just aero benefits either, he says, ‘considering all the aerodynamic forces that are in play, a rider could expect the same stability and handling characteristics from the Metron RS wheels as what is found on the Metron SL wheels’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those aerodynamic forces include those from the update rim design too. Vision has designed the rims around 28mm and wider tyres by boosting the internal rim width to 23mm. This results in aero gains thanks to a smooth transition from wheel to tyre, while also allowing for lower tyre pressures to be run, improving both rolling resistance and comfort. The rims are still hooked too, so no safety compromises have been made in Vision’s quest for performance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are more design updates beyond that too. Vision’s rim graphics are now applied during moulding and lamination, which saves a further 22g; the carbon spoke holes are made in the mould, so they aren’t drilled and don’t sacrifice the carbon’s strength and durability; and Vision has also improved its lamination process to make it even more reliable.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB09917-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB09917-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB09917-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB09917-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB09917-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB09917-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB09917-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB09917-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB09917-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB09917-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/JMB09917-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there’s the new V-100 hub, which Vision has redesigned for both performance and maintenance benefits. Firstly the weight has been reduced thanks to new freehub machining, it also offers smoother rotation and improved durability thanks to the ceramic bearings, and it uses a press-fit end cup and freehub system with a floating ratchet for tool-free maintenance. Vision’s updated hub also includes a boost to a 72-tooth ratchet for extra responsive engagement at just a 5° angle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\"

the SL, while also being more aerodynamic, offering increased lateral and torsional stiffness plus easier maintenance, and keeping handling characteristics at the highest level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, Vision does it all in-house: design, productions, assembling and testing, so everything is done with absolute precision and control, with no compromise.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\"
