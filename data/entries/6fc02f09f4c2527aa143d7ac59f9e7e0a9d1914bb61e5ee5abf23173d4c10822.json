Given my interests, I’d have been delighted by <em>The iOS App Icon Book</em> even if it had merely been pretty good. But it’s a splendid book — carefully curated, exquisitely well-designed, and very nicely printed and bound. It’s no small trick to reproduce icons meant for screens in a printed book. <em>The iOS App Icon Book</em> is also very well-written and considered, particularly regarding the seminal design shift introduced by iOS 7 in 2013.</p>\n\n<p>So a sibling volume dedicated to Mac app icons? Hell yes.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/macos-app-icon-book\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6fc02f09f4c2527aa143d7ac59f9e7e0a9d1914bb61e5ee5abf23173d4c10822","category":"Tech"}
