Looking at this thing, you might expect to see it propped up at an airport bar, in front of somebody talking into wireless headphones about Tim in Product. But there’s a lot of frame-rendering and multicore processing power inside this glass-fronted slab with a keyboard cover. It's an impressive showcase for AMD's leap forward in integrated power.</p>\n<p>The Z13 can rip through <i>Hitman</i> and <i>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</i> on their highest settings at its native 2560×1600 resolution. Turn the resolution down to a reasonable-for-this-size 1920×1080 and you can play <i>Cyberpunk 2077 </i>at its Ultra settings at 45–55 frames per second, depending on your power and upscaling preferences. On a device that is essentially a beefy Microsoft Surface, this is no small thing. The <a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/ai-300-series/amd-ryzen-ai-max-plus-395.html\">AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395</a> \"Strix Halo\" inside the Z13, with the latest Ryzen 8060S GPU built into it, is not just capable—it's a step up from most of the gaming laptops out there.</p>\n<p>As a Windows convertible, it has some interesting tech and notable upgrades from the 2022 product that was also called the ROG Flow Z13. Its webcam works with Windows Hello and logs you in 95 percent of the time. The keyboard has decent travel, the trackpad has a pleasant smoothness, and you can prop the thing up anywhere along the solid kickstand’s 170-degree range. It’s a Copilot+ PC if that matters to you, and when you’re not pushing ray-traced gaming frames, its battery life is no slouch.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/review-asus-rog-flow-z13-tablet-takes-the-asterisk-off-integrated-gpus/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/review-asus-rog-flow-z13-tablet-takes-the-asterisk-off-integrated-gpus/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6392a3e75111a110e9b0bcc824999e588202d5d9e6ca477c77cd30a16cab7b00","category":"Tech"}
