Included in the post were some of SentinelOne’s suspicions: the detection of shellcode, code injection to other process memory space, and other trademarks of software exploitation.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Is anyone else seeing this issue with other A/V vendors?</p>\n<p>Post Exploitation<br />\nPenetration framework or shellcode was detected<br />\nEvasion<br />\nIndirect command was executed<br />\nCode injection to other process memory space during the target process' initialization<br />\n\\Device\\HarddiskVolume4\\Users\\**USERNAME**\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\3CXDesktopApp\\3CXDesktopApp.exe<br />\nSHA1 e272715737b51c01dc2bed0f0aee2bf6feef25f1</p>\n<p>I'm also getting the same trigger when attempting to redownload the app from the web client ( 3CXDesktopApp-18.12.416.msi ).</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Defaulting to trust</h2>\n<p>Other users quickly jumped in to report receiving the same warnings from their SentinelOne software. They all reported receiving the warning while running 18.0 Update 7 (Build 312) of the 3CXDesktopApp for Windows. Users soon decided the detection was a false positive triggered by a glitch in the SentinelOne product. They created an exception to allow the suspicious app to run without interference. On Friday, a day later, and again on the following Monday and Tuesday, more users reported receiving the SentinelOne warning.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928121#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928121&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c834d2c5aa4957c3e4e95b5580e58640fbdbee85c1b6c6c20d5baa7252babe1d","category":"Tech"}
