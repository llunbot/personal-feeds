One moment, we were riding in jackets and tights, and the next minute it was suddenly all ‘sun’s out, guns out’.</p>\n<p>So, you’ll be wanting a nice loose jersey so you can keep yourself cool and retain some freedom of movement on those blisteringly hot summer rides, right? Nope. The Gore Chase cycling jersey is a fabulous object lesson in how a figure-hugging (and I mean figure-hugging) aero jersey can actually be the best choice for moisture and temperature regulation on the hottest days of a British summer.</p>\n<h3>The fit</h3>\n<p>The Gore Chase aero cycling jersey is unashamedly tight fitting – which follows, given that its stated inspiration is the racing world’s ‘singular focus on speed, watts and aerodynamics’. How this translates to the fit is as you’d expect.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wiggle.co.uk/gore-wear-chase-cycling-jersey\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Buy the Gore Chase cycling jersey now from Wiggle</em></strong></a></p>\n<p>You won’t get the male and female parts of the zipper to meet up unless you bend double, and you’ll pray that it doesn’t come unstitched when you pull the semi-lock puller up to your neck. That’s after you’ve pushed your arms through the longer than average sleeves of the jersey to the point where its minimal (yet sewn) hems lightly grip betwixt bicep and elbow.</p>\n<p>Many aero minimalism purists might prefer and expect raw-cut hems on the sleeves, but the raised stitching on the inside doesn’t interfere. A note on that neck: it’s very low-cut, almost to the depth down the chest you’d see on a time-trial skinsuit.</p>\n<h3>The comfort</h3>\n<p>To this point, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the Gore Chase jersey sounds rather restrictive in use, and that’s where you’d be mistaken.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/07/gore-wear-chase-cycling-jersey-jerseys-multi-ss21-100739mc0004-3.jpeg?itok=oRSEGB_z\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Once hunched over the bars, the form-fitting polyester/elastane construction has bags of stretch to move with your torso. It almost feels like a second skin, and this analogy extends to its abaility to spirit away moisture. Sweat formed on your back quickly evaporates through an almost open weave contruction. The frontal area allows cooling air to travel through its lightweight fabric to keep you comfortable at speed.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/913/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2021: Route, teams and all you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/2104/vuelta-a-espana-route-race-reports-tv-guide-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Vuelta a Espana 2021: Route, start list, live TV guide and all we know so far</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/reviews/667/the-best-turbo-trainers-a-buyers-guide\">Best smart turbo trainers: Top Zwift compatible indoor trainers</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nI didn’t experience one moment of clamminess whilst wearing the Gore Chase jersey, and once home from a ride mostly undertaken in 25°C heat, it only took half an hour to dry completely over the back of a garden chair. It might be lightweight but it’s deceptively useful, not to mention practical.</p>\n<h3>The practicalities</h3>\n<p>I do favour an aero jersey on days when feeling quick is as important as actually being quick. However, my considerable experience of wearing skin-tight sporting attire has generally led to being let down by the details.</p>\n<p>The Gore Chase jersey does at least go some way to alleviating my usual aero frustrations. Firstly, the rear hem is markedly dropped, allowing the jersey – by way of light-touch silicon gripper material – to hug the small of your back.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wiggle.co.uk/gore-wear-chase-cycling-jersey\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Buy the Gore Chase cycling jersey now from Wiggle</em></strong></a></p>\n<p>No riding up, easy access to the pockets. And those pockets, while typically restrained by the narrow width of the panel making up the rear of this aero jersey, do at least have some carrying capacity for essentials. This is bolstered considerably by a separate zipped compartment to the right-hand side.</p>\n<p>It might just about swallow an iPhone 5, but forget squeezing anything larger in there. It is, however, perfect for valuables like keys or a bank card.</p>\n<h3>The upshot</h3>\n<p>All in all, the Gore Chase jersey marries aero performance, more than respectable comfort and a hint of practicality to create an item of summer riding attire that not only allows you to ride on the front with confidence, but also to stash your legwarmers or a race cape for the changeable climes of a British summer.</p>\n<p>For a penny shy of £130 it might cost more than an increasing number of very good budget options, but its performance credentials aren’t in doubt. Added bonus: when did you last see a jersey design that looks like a cross between oil on water and 1980s colour TV static? It’s a ‘win, win’ for me. </p>\n  </div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"260aa5839d717239b511763e47089972cd2e32efc33f182d3c8059d4b0a1f210","category":"Cycling"}
