At times, Lodge allegedly allowed buyers to enter the morgue and look through cadavers, essentially shopping for the body parts they wanted to purchase. Shoppers sometimes bought them directly, transporting them out of the state on their own. At other times, Lodge shipped them or brought them to his home in New Hampshire, where he had help selling them from his wife, Denise Lodge, 63, who is also charged.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948190#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948190&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4b3724f550aba9b3b00a940b9a639f239e4e862ecafab3399a13201293e92cda","category":"Tech"}
