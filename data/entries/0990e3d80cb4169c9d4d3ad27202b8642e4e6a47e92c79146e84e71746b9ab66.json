{"title":"More Support for Breaking Out Apple Passwords Into a Standalone App","link":"https://sixcolors.com/link/2023/03/ios-and-macoss-passwords-feature-needs-an-app/","date":1680302831000,"content":"\n<p>Dan Moren at Six Colors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Unlike Cabel, however, I would like Apple to implement some sort\nof family sharing feature for Passwords. I share a bunch of logins\nwith my wife, and while I can share them with 1Password, there’s\nan additional hurdle to getting someone on a third-party app that\nrequires their own account, etc. Especially as we shift more and\nmore to passkeys, where traditional methods of sharing will be\nimpractical, it’s more important that Apple make it easier to\nshare credentials.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When I linked to <a href=\"https://cabel.com/2023/03/27/apple-passwords-deserve-an-app/\">Cabel Sasser’s entreaty</a> for breaking Apple Passwords out of a Settings panel and into a proper standalone app, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/27/apple-passwords-deserve-an-app\">I didn’t mention sharing</a>, but I agree with Moren: sooner rather than later, Apple ought to support family sharing for passwords and other security credentials. Sasser’s line about sharing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The idea is not to <em>replace</em> third-party password apps, as I do\nnot wish a Sherlocking on anyone. Those apps should, and currently\ndo, offer more features than Apple ever will, like cross-platform\nsupport, team/family password sharing, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But sharing is too important to ignore, especially at the small scale of family sharing. Let’s face it, when we talk about Apple sherlocking<sup>*</sup> apps in this space, we’re really just talking about <a href=\"https://1password.com/\">1Password</a>. There are other credible password managers but 1Password is the one that Mac and iOS users care about. But I think it’s clear that 1Password themselves <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2022/05/03/1password-8-for-mac/\">have moved in an enterprise direction</a>. Apple Notes added robust small-scale sharing years ago and hasn’t sherlocked the market for third-party notes apps. I think the same would be true for passwords.</p>\n\n<p><small>* The DF Style Guide Desk is making a call: it’s time to lowercase the verb <em>sherlock</em>.</small></p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/31/more-support-for-breaking-out-apple-passwords-into-a-standalone-app\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0990e3d80cb4169c9d4d3ad27202b8642e4e6a47e92c79146e84e71746b9ab66","category":"Tech"}
