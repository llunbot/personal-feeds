I’ve since had some time to play with the tools and deliver some first impressions.</p>\n<h3>Feedback Chain Tool 3.0</h3>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Could Feedback's Chain Tool 3.0 be the last chain tool you ever need?\" title=\"BikeRadar_200423_kg0273\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Could Feedback’s Chain Tool 3.0 be the last chain tool you ever need?</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£39.99/$40/€45</li>\n</ul><p>Feedback’s third-generation Chain Tool 3.0 is claimed to be a “one-time purchase, guaranteed”.</p>\n<p>Weighing in at 165g, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-chain-tool/\">chain tool</a> features a larger rubber handle with a knurled texture to improve grip. There’s also a larger, more ergonomic rubberised plastic handle for the pin driver.</p>\n<p>An adjustable chain support is a nifty feature that makes sure the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bicycle-chains/\">chain</a> is supported properly in the recesses of the tool before driving the pin through.</p>\n<p>The bar-plug style base of the tool hides a spare pin (there’s room for a spare <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/chain-quick-links/\">quick link</a> too).</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/BikeRadar200423kg0290-8f6d2c7.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Feedback Chain Tool 3.0 on a slate background\" title=\"Feedback Chain Tool 3.0 on a slate background\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The handle is comfortable to grip. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/BikeRadar200423kg0292-befd1f0.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Feedback Chain Tool 3.0 on a slate background\" title=\"Feedback Chain Tool 3.0 on a slate background\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>I particularly appreciated the chain support feature. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/BikeRadar200423kg0295-4ff9be1.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Feedback Chain Tool 3.0 on a slate background\" title=\"Feedback Chain Tool 3.0 on a slate background\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>There’s in-built storage at the base of the tool. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>The Chain Tool 3.0 is compatible with Shimano and SRAM chains up to 12-speed and it will work with Campagnolo 13-speed too. However, the tool won’t peen a Campagnolo chain.</p>\n<p>I’ve been impressed by this chain breaker. The tool action is very smooth for its asking price and I particularly appreciate the adjustable chain support.</p>\n<p>You have to hold some other tools at an angle to make sure the driver pin is being driven straight through the chain pin, which can be quite frustrating.</p>\n<p>If you’re after a near-enough shop-quality chain tool to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-replace-a-bicycle-chain/\">replace your chain</a> at not too great a cost (and you’re not running Campagnolo chains that require peening), this one is hard to overlook.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Feedback Reflex Fixed Torque Ratchet Kit</h3>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Feedback Reflex Fixed Torque Ratchet Kit\" title=\"Feedback Reflex Fixed Torque Ratchet Kit\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Feedback is jumping on the portable bit-ratchet bandwagon.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£70/$70/€85</li>\n</ul><p>Designed to be taken on rides, the Feedback Reflex Fixed Torque Ratchet Kit is a bit-based ratcheting <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-multi-tool/\">multi-tool</a>.</p>\n<p>It features a modular handle and 10 S2 steel bits (2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5 and 6mm hex, T10, 25, 30 torx and a 3mm flat-blade screwdriver).</p>\n<p>There’s a 5Nm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-torque-wrench/\">torque</a> fitting, which snaps audibly once you reach the desired torque.

The kit weighs 367g without the case.</p>\n<p>The Reflex Ratchet Kit has proven a sound performer so far and there is a loud snap when you reach 5Nm.</p>\n<p>One thing to note is Feedback says the torque adaptor needs bedding in before it will read accurately at 5Nm, so make sure you use it on a bolt that requires significantly more torque to avoid breaking a component.</p>\n<p>This kit won’t replace my <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/high-mileage-heroes-oscars-favourite-workshop-tools/\">Silca Ti-Torque with T-Ratchet</a>. Silca’s offering feels more ergonomic in the hand, the ratchet is noticeably smoother and it can achieve a range of torques between 2 and 8Nm. Granted though, Feedback’s tool is half the price.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Feedback Rotor Truing Fork 2.0</h3>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Feedback Rotor Truing Fork 2.0\" title=\"Feedback Rotor Truing Fork 2.0\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The tool can be used on both 2.0 and 2.3mm width rotors.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£16/$15/€18</li>\n</ul><p>Feedback has updated its rotor truing tool, with the new version featuring slots for bending both 2.0 and 2.3mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/6-of-the-best-disc-brake-rotors/\">disc brake rotors</a>, as well as a second 2.0mm slot at the tapered end.</p>\n<p>The tool’s steel core is combined with a nylon-reinforced grip. This means the tool can also be used as a piston press – if it were metal, you’d risk damaging or scratching the pistons.</p>\n<p>The tool weighs 73g on my digital scales.</p>\n<p>The tool does what it says on the tin, although I prefer to bend a rotor back by hand with a lint-free rag sandwiched between my hand and the rotor. This is because I find dedicated tools can sometimes put too much force on the rotor.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Feedback Thru-Axle Chain Keeper</h3>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Feedback Thru-Axle Chain Keeper\" title=\"Feedback Thru-Axle Chain Keeper\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A chain keeper can be useful when cleaning your bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£14.99/$10/€12</li>\n</ul><p>The Feedback Thru-Axle Chain Keeper is designed to hold your chain when you’re working on or washing a bike with the rear wheel uninstalled.</p>\n<p>The tool will fit 12mm thru-axle dropouts and the roller is made of a bio-based PA56 plastic.

It’s readily available as the ‘43-2 Universal 2-jaw puller with self-centering jaw’ on Kukko’s online store.</p>\n<p>CeramicSpeed manufactures the two drifts included in the kit. The smaller one covers the axle when you’re removing the bearing so the puller has something to pull against.

You then use a hammer to drive them out while bracing the frame. Not only is it wince-inducing to hammer out a bearing, these tools often damage the bearing on the way out.</p>\n<p>This is especially annoying when the bottom bracket you’re removing isn’t worn.</p>\n<p>Enduro Bearings was one of the first brands to introduce a hammer-free solution to removing press-fit bearings with its BRT-002 and BRT-003 bearing kits.

There’s a rubber ring at the end of the ratchet and the handle also flares out for improved grip.</p>\n<p>Available in 1/4in, 3/8in or 1/2in flavours, the ratchet mechanism has 90 teeth, translating into a satisfyingly smooth feel.</p>\n<p>This tool has quickly become one of my favourite larger ratchets, in combination with Wera’s trusty Zyklop Mini for harder-to-access and lower-torque areas.</p>\n<h3>Nepros 3/8 Sq.
