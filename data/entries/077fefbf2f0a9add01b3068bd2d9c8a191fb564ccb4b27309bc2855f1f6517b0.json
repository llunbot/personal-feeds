Tom’s been a driving force in the bike biz since welding his first mountain bike frame almost fifty years ago. Now, under the name Moutain Bikes by Tom, he is bringing back his coveted Bullmoose Bars and Bi-Plane Forks. The intent is that existing owners of original Ritchey frames that don’t have the correct fork and bars will be able to buy the correct parts as made by the OG himself. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-bar-and-fork-mounted.jpeg\"><img width=\"953\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-bar-and-fork-mounted.jpeg\" alt=\"Ritchey 2024 Bullmoose and Biplane Fork bar and fork mounted\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-bar-and-fork-mounted.jpeg 953w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-bar-and-fork-mounted-223x300.jpeg 223w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-bar-and-fork-mounted-89x120.jpeg 89w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-bar-and-fork-mounted-768x1032.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Ritchey Logic)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom will be launching this limited run at this year’s MADE Show in Portland and “accepting orders from existing Ritchey Owners.” Does that mean you <em>have</em> to already own a Ritchey to buy a fork and bar?

That meant a bicycle that included forks that had a specific rake and flex to handle off-road riding with confidence. It was also about task-specific, assertive cock pits that didn’t slip or give while riding new terrain. While he was producing the first mountain bike frames he had already thought of a comprehensive solution. He knew what was needed for these new off-road machines. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-from-the-top.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-from-the-top.jpeg\" alt=\"Ritchey 2024 Bullmoose and Biplane Fork from the top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-from-the-top.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-from-the-top-297x157.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-from-the-top-120x64.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-from-the-top-768x407.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Bullmoose bar </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-what-the-fork.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-what-the-fork.jpeg\" alt=\"Ritchey 2024 Bullmoose and Biplane Fork what the fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-what-the-fork.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-what-the-fork-297x167.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-what-the-fork-120x68.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-what-the-fork-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-what-the-fork-1200x675.jpeg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Bi-Plane fork</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter the Bullmoose Bar and Bi-plane forks. These signature bars and forks were sold as original equipment on the early Mountain Bikes by Ritchey. As it turned out, demand for these bikes rose faster than Tom could keep up with. So a different solution was reached. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Buried in the legend of the “Chicken Coop” bike and other frames of that era were a few hundred frames were sold without their intended forks and thus began their lives somewhat incomplete.”</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-holding-bar.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-holding-bar.jpeg\" alt=\"Ritchey 2024 Bullmoose and Biplane Fork holding bar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-holding-bar.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-holding-bar-297x167.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-holding-bar-120x68.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-holding-bar-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-holding-bar-1200x675.jpeg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-from-the-side.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-from-the-side.jpeg\" alt=\"Ritchey 2024 Bullmoose and Biplane Fork from the side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-from-the-side.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-from-the-side-297x167.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-from-the-side-120x68.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-from-the-side-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ritchey-2024-Bullmoose-and-Biplane-Fork-from-the-side-1200x675.jpeg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Came to MADE and Meet Tom</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Visit Ritchey at MADE, booth #358, August 23-25, during the following hours:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Friday, August 23, 12:00-6:00 p.m.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saturday, August 24, 10:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunday, August 25, 10:00 a.m. – 4:00 p.m.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://ritcheylogic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RitcheyLogic.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://made.bike/\" target=\"_blank\">MADE.Bike</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/tom-ritchey-mountain-bikes-by-tom-ltd-bullmoose-bars-bi-plane-forks-made/\">Tom Ritchey to Launch Mountain Bikes by Tom w/ LTD Bullmoose Bars &amp; Bi-Plane Forks at MADE</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"077fefbf2f0a9add01b3068bd2d9c8a191fb564ccb4b27309bc2855f1f6517b0","category":"Cycling"}
