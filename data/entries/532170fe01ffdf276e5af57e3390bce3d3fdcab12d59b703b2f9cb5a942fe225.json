Clipless pedal systems include a mechanism that attaches a cleat bolted to the base of your shoe to the pedal. This will give you improved support, security and power transfer for greater pedalling efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working a bit like ski bindings, you simply step onto the pedal and it’ll automatically lock you into place, while a quick twist of the foot releases your shoe. There’s a knack to learning how to use them but once you’ve learned, you’re unlikely to look back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With single-sided road systems focussing on achieving maximum stiffness and minimum weight, the downside to this is greater difficulty when walking. By comparison, mountain bike or touring systems are usually double-sided, meaning you can clip into either side of the pedal. Not only does this make them easier to clip into, but the smaller cleats they use are recessed in the sole of your shoe, so walking is significantly easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bearing this in mind, we’ve rounded up examples of our favourite road systems, plus some mountain bike-style alternatives worth considering if you’re riding a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-gravel-bike\" target=\"_blank\">gravel bike</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/commuting\" target=\"_blank\">commuting </a>or want an easier entry point to riding clipless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep reading for our favourite pedals for all occasions. Or if you want to know more, scroll a bit further for our guide covering everything you always wanted to know about clipping-in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve quoted system weight for each pedal set. That includes the pedals, cleats and mounting hardware (bolts and any adapters needed). The weight is for a pair.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best road bike pedals</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Look Keo 2 Max Carbon</strong>: <strong>RRP £99 – Buy now from </strong><a

for road riding and two-bolt pedals for off-road and commuting use. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website editor <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/author/matthew-loveridge\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Loveridge</a>, pictured above, is a long-time Wahoo Speedplay and Shimano SPD user, but our highly experienced reviewers regularly swap between pedals and cover the whole gamut of systems, including Shimano, Look and Time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although we all have our preferences, no-one uses one pedal system to the exclusion of all others. We know our pedals and what makes a great pedal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best road bike pedals 2023 in-depth</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Look Keo 2 Max Carbon</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02122406/look_keo_2_max_carbon_pedla.jpeg\" alt=\"look_keo_2_max_carbon_pedla\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£79 (RRP £99) | <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6411&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tweekscycles.com%2Flook-keo-2-max-carbon-pedals-with-keo-grip-cleat-campek2m16090%2F\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>System weight: 321g</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Carbon body, Large surface area</strong> </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite sitting in the middle of Look’s hierarchy, its Keo 2 Max Carbon pedals might be its most attractive proposition. You get the low weight you’d hope for, given their carbon construction. However, unlike the top of the line Keo Blades, they still come with adjustable tension.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In practice, this means you can choose how tightly they grip your cleats. This trait is great for beginners, who probably want the release tension low, as well as pros, who’ll like to dial it right up, plus everyone in-between.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They come with a pair of grey Look Keo Grip cleats, which offer a moderate 4.5° float. Again this is likely to suit pretty much everyone, and it’s doubtful you’ll end up locked in the wrong position or that your feet will swing about too much. In fact, our tester referred to them as ‘the baby bear’s porridge of cleats’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As is the nature of all pedal marketing materials, the latest version of the Keo 2 Max Carbon pedal promises an enlarged usable contact surface to its stainless steel plate. Ensuring a relatively broad platform on which to connect, Look claims its 60mm width offers 25% more surface than before. To be honest, we found it satisfactory before, and can only assume this new version is an improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/look-keo-2-max-carbon-road-pedals-review\" target=\"_blank\">Look Keo 2 Max Carbon pedal review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shimano Ultegra R8000 pedals</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02122404/shimano_ultegra_r8000_pedals-970x776.jpg\" alt=\"shimano_ultegra_r8000_pedals\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£86.99 (RRP £160) | <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=2698&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chainreactioncycles.com%2Fp%2Fshimano-ultegra-r8000-carbon-spd-sl-road-pedals%3Fcolor%3Dgrey\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>System weight: 302g</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Highly durable, 4mm longer axles available</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of not being the lightest, nor sporting the lowest stack height, the Shimano Ultegra pedals do an excellent job, being in our experience the most durable road pedals on the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The amount of force required to release your feet is easily controlled via an adjustable spring, while the extra height conceals bearings that will last years between services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three different cleats allow you to tune the range of float between 0 and 6°. Once engaged, the available movement feels less slippery than some, which will suit certain riders but not all. The cleats provide ample lateral adjustment.

It’s a quality that makes them ideal for those whose foot moves laterally through the pedal stroke or who find the lower adjustability of other systems uncomfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speedplay’s design also brings the two components really close together for a low stack height, which improves pedalling dynamics, all thanks to the four-bolt cleat (through a three-bolt converter is available to make them compatible with a wider choice of shoes). They also look splendidly minimalist on the bike – which never hurts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wahoo Speedplay Zero pedals, although not the other Speedplay pedals, also offer four axle lengths, which adds even more fine-tuning of your stance width. Still a little trickier to learn how to use than other brands, Wahoo Speedplay’s benefits nevertheless continue to win its pedals legions of devotees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This hardwearing stainless version is one of the more cost-efficient, with Wahoo Speedplay’s prices going up to the £380 titanium Nano with plenty of stops in between.

The connection is spring-loaded and releases with a twist of the foot. Rather than fixing your feet rigidly most clipless pedals allow some movement or ‘float’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of road cycling shoes come with a three-bolt design, as pioneered by Look. Speedplay uses a four-bolt connection between the cleat and the shoe’s sole, whereas two bolts are used on the smaller MTB cleats, which are less cumbersome and the best option if you’ll be doing any significant walking in your cycling shoes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll find that above a certain price, bikes no longer come with pedals, or come with basic plastic ones. In part, this saves money but since pedals are a such a personal thing, it means you can choose a pair that suit your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going with the first thing the shop assistant suggests or picking the ones that are half price online might not be the best approach. We’ve rounded up clipless road bike pedals (so-called because they do away with traditional toe-clips) from the leading makers and tried them for ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve also enlisted the help of pedal expert Spencer Wilson to explain what we should be looking for, along with the pros and cons of each system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘No single feature, be it weight, rotational movement, float, or whatever else makes a pedal the “best”,’ says Wilson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘At Personal Bikefit, the most important factor for us to understand is how the pedal interacts with the shoe, and therefore the wearer while riding. Does it provide a degree of guidance for your foot so that the union between shoe and pedal is secure? Or, is there a lack of guidance allowing the foot to move too freely?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘At the same time, you don’t want your foot excessively fixed – a frequent problem that was found with early clipless pedals – as in some cases, this can result in knee injuries.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wilson continues: ‘Rider biomechanics are also a crucial factor when it comes to picking a pedal. So, for example, weak glutes can force riders to drive forces across the top of the pedal instead of pushing downward and evenly onto the pedal platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s no good having a large pedal/shoe interface if the forces are not being applied to it evenly. If the loading forces aren’t in line with the pedal spindle, for example, or your knees aren’t able to track in a vertically straight line, then no kind of pedal – no matter how well-made it is – will be able to correct this,’ Wilson adds.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/09/02115301/how_to_remove_bicycle_pedals_06-reattach-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"how_to_remove_bicycle_pedals_06-reattach\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What to look out for</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Platform size</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The bigger the pedal surface area, or platform, the more robust the relationship between the cleat and the pedal will be. This helps keep the pedal as comfortable during the fifth hour of a ride as it is during the first, while also providing the most efficient power transfer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Q Factor adjustment</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Q Factor is the distance between the centreline of the pedals, laterally. Not all pelvic widths are the same! To produce maximum power, the knee needs to track in a vertical line as this is both most efficient and reduces the risk of knee pain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look for cleats with good lateral adjustment or, even better, use pedals that are available with different axle lengths – higher spec Shimano pedals offer this, but the Wahoo Speedplay Zero pedals are the Q Factor kings with four different axle lengths available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Float</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A cleat and pedal system with a zero-degree or ‘fixed’ float will lock your feet rigidly in place. However, most riders will prefer to have a little wiggle room. Measured in degrees, float is the amount that your heel can move side-to-side before disengaging from the pedal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most manufacturers sell different cleats with different amounts of float, while Speedplay cleats can be carefully adjusted to tailor the degree of rotational freedom available for your foot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Release tension</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A special consideration for riders new to using clipless pedals and who need easy engagement and disengagement. More experienced riders, especially those who like to mash the pedals when sprinting, frequently prefer the security offered by a stiffer release tension.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many high-end pedals now use a carbon leaf spring instead of the traditional coiled steel spring to provide tension. This saves weight but means that the effort needed to clip out can only be adjusted in fixed increments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pedals that possess a good range of spring tension can be adjusted for novice and elite riders alike, while some pedals have easier release for new clipped-in riders or those who prefer a very low release tension.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>A good range and adjustment of rotation</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Riders with biomechanical imbalances and lower-limb issues may need a more precise setup and require more rotation. Speedplay pedals are the perfect choice for this, allowing 15° of rotation right down to zero. Time pedals also allow a large degree of float.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This not only protects your knees against potential damage but means there’s less chance of you accidentally unclipping. It can feel as if your pedal stroke is a little unguided though.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Reliability</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a sometimes forgotten factor in pedal choice. In order to slim down their pedals, manufacturers use smaller and smaller bearings and bushes. While these can be replaced fairly cheaply, doing so can be tricky and time-consuming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For our money, you can’t beat Shimano for durability, although Look has upgraded its bearings too recently.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Stack height</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The height from the pedal axle to the sole of the foot. If you choose pedals with a high stack height, you may also need to raise your saddle height in order to compensate. In theory, a lower stack height increases pedalling efficiency, although in practice the effects are slight and you’re unlikely to notice them.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-the-best-clipless-road-bike-pedals\">Best road bike pedals 2023</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"jgibbons","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"532170fe01ffdf276e5af57e3390bce3d3fdcab12d59b703b2f9cb5a942fe225","category":"Cycling"}
