As I write this, <a href=\"https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/\">the center's website</a> remains offline. That's because Asheville, a city in North Carolina's Blue Ridge Mountains, is the epicenter of catastrophic flooding from Hurricane Helene that has played out over the last week. The climate data facility is inoperable because water and electricity services in the region have entirely broken down due to flooding.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053311#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053311&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0b6b59ff6e78c76c872c3ef538bb4568d38a1d18428049d85ea8d059845ea389","category":"Tech"}
