While Masimo's fight focuses on the Apple Watch's blood oxygen sensing capabilities, AliveCor contends that Apple is in breach of patent with its ECG technology.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAliveCor demonstrated a prototype Apple Watch band with a built-in ECG sensor to Apple in 2015. Apple then unveiled its own built-in ECG technology in 2018 with the Apple Watch Series 4, leading AliveCor to argue that Apple had stolen its technology and request that the ITC bans Apple Watch sales in the United States. AliveCor also initiated an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/26/alivecor-apple-watch-antitrust-lawsuit/\">antitrust lawsuit</a> against Apple, alleging that it was making it needlessly difficult for third-party apps to access the Apple Watch's heart rate data.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a statement to <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/12/26/alivecor-apple-watch-ban-patents/\"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>, AliveCor expressed its support for Masimo and praised the move to ban Apple Watch sales:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<blockquote>This is the second time in less than 12 months President Biden has allowed an International Trade Commission Limited Exclusion Order (LEO) to stand against imports of Apple Watches that violate the patents of small U.S. innovators. Earlier this year, AliveCor's patent for its FDA-cleared personal electrocardiogram (ECG) technology was similarly affirmed and we share our support today for Masimo's tenacity in its face off with Apple. Innovator companies and health consumers alike should be encouraged that industry giants are increasingly being held accountable for anticompetitive practices that would ultimately limit access to potentially life-saving technology.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ITC <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/22/biden-admin-upholds-apple-watch-patent-ruling/\">ruled in favor of AliveCor</a>'s patent infringement claims, but the case did not result in a ban on Apple Watch sales as AliveCor hoped. Unlike AliveCor, Masimo argues that Apple actively hired its engineers and key executives to steal technology. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/alivecor/\">AliveCor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/masimo/\">Masimo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/alivecor-praises-apple-watch-ban/\">AliveCor Praises Apple Watch Ban Amid Its Own Health Tech Patent Dispute With Apple</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/alivecor-praises-apple-watch-ban-amid-its-own-health-tech-patent-dispute-with-apple.2414774/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"354d63c7d9ac321534ea8f4b21e0a7fafac506eae8b0f358cabf770f5287c4b6","category":"Apple"}
