But before I start quoting, man, his report reads as though he’s gotten the notes from someone who’s already watched Monday’s keynote. I sort of think that’s what happened, given how much of this no one had reported before today. Bloomberg’s headline even boldly asserts “Here’s Everything Apple Plans to Show at Its AI-Focused WWDC Event”. I’m only aware of one feature for one platform that isn’t in his report, but it’s not a jaw-dropper so I wouldn’t be surprised if it was simply beneath his threshold for newsworthiness. Don’t follow the link to Bloomberg and don’t continue reading this post if you don’t want to see a bunch of spoilers, several of which weren’t even rumors until Gurman dropped this. It’s astonishing how much of what we supposedly know about Apple’s WWDC keynote announcements is entirely from Gurman. If he switched to a different beat we’d be almost entirely in the dark; as it stands, he’s seemingly spoiled most of it.</p>\n\n<p>First, he says yes, Apple’s going to do a chatbot, powered by OpenAI:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The company’s new AI system will be called Apple Intelligence, and\nit will come to new versions of the iPhone, iPad and Mac operating\nsystems, according to people familiar with the plans. There also\nwill be a partnership with OpenAI that powers a ChatGPT-like\nchatbot. And the tech giant is preparing to show new software for\nthe Vision Pro headset, Apple Watch and TV platforms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A question Gurman’s report doesn’t answer is <em>where</em> this chatbot will be. Is it going to be a new app — a dedicated AI chatbot app? What would that app be called? “Siri”? Or will it live within Spotlight, a system-level UI you dip in and out of temporarily, not an app? Spotlight works today because you more or less can only ask one thing at a time; a chat app is something with persistence, that you can Command-Tab to and from.</p>\n\n<p>Or would Apple make Siri a persona you can chat with in Messages? I don’t think Apple would put it in Messages, but if they do, will we be able to include it in group chats? That seems like fun on the surface (<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/04/wavelength-bot-designer\">and it is, in Wavelength</a>) but a privacy problem on deeper thought. When I’m talking to Siri one-on-one I expect Siri to know about me. If Siri/Apple AI/whatever-it’s-going-to-be-called were in a group Messages chat it would have to be private, which would make it a different Siri/Apple AI/whatever than you get in a one-on-one context.</p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of questions even if the answer is that it’s a new standalone app. Will the conversations sync between devices? If so, how does that jibe with on-device processing? If I start a chatbot conversation on my Mac can I continue it on my iPhone? How does that work if the conversation pertains to, say, files or data that’s only on my Mac? Or vice-versa, if it pertains to content in an app that’s only on my iPhone? On-device processing raises questions that don’t exist with cloud-only processing.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One feature that will likely get a lot of attention among Gen\nZ — and perhaps the rest of the population — will be\nAI-created emoji. This will use AI to create custom emoji\ncharacters on the fly that represent phrases or words as\nthey’re being typed. That means there will be many more\noptions than the ones in the standardized emoji library that\nhas long been built into the iPhone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/111115\">sounds like Memoji</a>, but for anything? Will it be exclusive to Messages or something system-wide, in the emoji picker?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Messages app is getting some non-AI tweaks, including a change\nto the effects feature — the thing that lets you send fireworks\nand other visual elements to the people you’re texting. Users will\nnow be able to trigger an effect with individual words, rather\nthan the entire message. There will be new colorful icons for\nTapbacks, which let you quickly respond to a message with a heart,\nexclamation point or other character (they’re currently gray). And\nusers will have the ability to Tapback a message with any emoji.\nThere’s another frequently requested feature coming as well: the\nability to schedule a message to be sent later.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not sure what the difference is between “colorful Tapbacks” and “Tapback a message with any emoji”, but this one gets a legit <em>finally</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Safari in macOS 15, codenamed Glow, is getting some changes, but\nit seems unlikely that Apple is going to unveil its own ad blocker — something that’s been reported as a possibility. Advertisers\nalready pushed back heavily against Apple’s App Tracking\nTransparency, or ATT, in iOS 14 a few years ago, and the company\ndoesn’t need another privacy-related headache.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Built-in ad blocking in Safari wouldn’t be a privacy headache; blocking ads can only increase privacy. It would be an antitrust/regulatory headache. The argument from ATT opponents is that it steers advertisers toward purchasing ads in the App Store, where the ATT rules don’t apply. Apple doesn’t track what users do <em>within</em> apps, of course — which is the legitimate privacy issue ATT attempts to address — but as the operator of the App Store, it does know which apps a user owns and uses. So Apple can, say, recommend game C because you play games A and B, even if A, B, and C all come from different developers.</p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"98ac12cc04b9e7f2bb068bb479b24392a0b147265e4215b676de6564ef6d4830","category":"Tech"}
