The term refers to finding people more attractive after drinking alcohol, and there is a wealth of scientific evidence both for and against its existence.</p>\n<p>The effect has become a trope in popular culture, with countless shows and movies referencing it. Bart sees Aunt Selma as a beautiful young woman through a pair of Duff beer goggles in <em>The Simpsons</em>, while <em>Mythbusters</em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B33qfBK07I8\">even tested</a> whether the effect was real (they concluded it was plausible).</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.jsad.com/doi/10.15288/jsad.22-00355\">latest study</a> to throw its hat into the ring was published in the <em>Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs</em> by scientists from the University of Pittsburgh and Stanford University. It has added to the pool of evidence that rejects the existence of beer goggles. But what the work found is that alcohol seems to give people “liquid courage,” increasing their willingness to interact with people they find attractive.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970085#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970085&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d90b6bddf6b7aba99ee8f07b781d5bccebaa45c1101b7c714bbdabfcdb0c10da","category":"Tech"}
