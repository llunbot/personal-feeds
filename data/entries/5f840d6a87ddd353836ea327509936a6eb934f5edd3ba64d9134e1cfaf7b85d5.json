This one includes 18 \"dungeons\" to teach you flexbox. This course is unique because you’re not writing pure CSS, but instead, you’re using Tailwind CSS classes, which means you’ll learn flexbox along with the syntax for Tailwind utility classes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/eb9f9378-ed07-43e8-982e-d4e0f38fac53/knightsflexbox.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Flexbox Froggy</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://flexboxfroggy.com/\">Flexbox Froggy</a> has been around for quite some time and continues to be a popular choice for learning flexbox syntax. Use the different parts of the flexbox spec to arrange the frogs as required to pass the different levels.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/80ac47d5-a549-41d3-a945-a5ffea57188e/flexbox-froggy.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Flexbox Zombies</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://geddski.teachable.com/p/flexbox-zombies\">Flexbox Zombies</a> is another educational game to learn flexbox syntax. Each section advances a zombie-related plot while giving you expertise in a new flexbox concept, along with survival challenges that help you use your new flexbox skills.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d87840e2-b3f6-4caa-a56e-5538043ac862/flexbox-zombies.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Flexbox Defense</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flexboxdefense.com/\">Flexbox Defense</a> is a play on the 'tower defense' strategy game genre that teaches you flexbox through 12 challenges where you have to use flexbox syntax to stop incoming enemies from getting past your defenses.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f0967bd2-5497-4043-9450-7830bd356581/flexbox-defense.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Flexy Boxes</h3>\n<p>If you find some of the other flexbox tools a little harder to work with, <a href=\"https://the-echoplex.net/flexyboxes/\">Flexy Boxes</a> might be a good choice. This is a straightforward flexbox playground that also generates the code for you. Being an older tool, this also provides legacy flexbox code and vendor prefixes but you can select \"Vanilla CSS\" for the code you’ll use in most cases.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/57c4707d-13c8-4954-84d3-244f6bb1f9a6/flexy-boxes.png\" /></p>\nTools To Learn CSS Grid Layout\n<h3>Grid Garden</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://cssgridgarden.com/\">Grid Garden</a>, from Codepip, the same makers as Flexbox Froggy, includes 28 different levels to teach you about the different parts of the CSS Grid Layout specification. And if you’re interested in more from these folks, their Pro plan includes a number of <a href=\"https://codepip.com/games/\">other CSS and JS interactive games</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9d7fcca4-1de4-4499-ac57-039dd96dfdae/grid-garden.png\" /></p>\n<h3>CSS Grid Cheat Sheet</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://alialaa.github.io/css-grid-cheat-sheet/\">CSS Grid Cheat Sheet</a> is a visual and interactive guide to understanding CSS Grid. Select a box in the grid, then use the options and settings in the left sidebar to fiddle with the different parts of the Grid Layout spec.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c9490069-a166-4841-8005-7ab85d05ad4b/cssgridcheatsheet.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Grid Attack</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://codingfantasy.com/games/css-grid-attack\">Grid Attack</a> is from the same creators as Flexbox Adventure, mentioned earlier. This one isn’t free but includes 80 interactive challenges that are similar to real-world grid layout problems.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5406285e-c8c5-4fd2-85fd-55929e8c824e/grid-attack.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Grid Critters</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://gridcritters.com/\">Grid Critters</a> is another interactive challenge-based platform to learn the different parts of the Grid Layout spec in a video-game-like environment. The course includes 10 chapters, each broken down into various levels, some as many as 20-26 levels.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9d8c813b-d86b-432f-9076-a977d31142cc/grid-critters.png\" /></p>\nTools to Learn More CSS Skills\n<h3>CSS Selectors Cheatsheet</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://frontend30.com/css-selectors-cheatsheet/\">CSS Selectors Cheatsheet</a> is an interactive exercise to test your understanding of CSS selectors. The first few are fairly easy but the exercises increase in difficulty as you get into more advanced selectors like lesser-used pseudo-classes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0ce9d843-3e10-40e2-a41a-92961d410fc2/cssselectorscheatsheet.png\" /></p>\n<h3>CSS Animations</h3>\n<p>If you want to advance your skills in doing animation on the web, <a href=\"https://css-animations.io/\">CSS Animations</a> is a solid, full-featured platform for learning and experimenting with the different parts of the CSS animations specification. This 32-part course has lots of pre-built graphics that are used in the course as a basis for the animations. This is a fun way to learn keyframe animations with CSS.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f1d68b98-6793-4da9-84d8-60595e1f14eb/cssanimations.png\" /></p>\n<h3>CSS Ruler</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://katydecorah.com/css-ruler/\">CSS Ruler</a> gives you a visual representation of three categories of CSS units you can experiment with: font relative (e.g. rem, ch), viewport percentage (e.g. vh, vw), and absolute (e.g. px, in).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/554ad12e-3634-45aa-97fb-0612f7ae8d00/css-ruler.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Filter Blend</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://ilyashubin.github.io/FilterBlend/\">Filter Blend</a> is a compact little site that lets you mess around with the different values used for CSS’s <code>mix-blend-mode</code>, <code>background-blend-mode</code>, and <code>filter</code> properties. You can add one or more of your own images in layers, along with a background color, then fiddle with the settings to see how the different values behave.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/43cf3c36-32c7-44c0-8503-aedb58ab38e8/fliter-blend.png\" /></p>\n<h3>CSSBattle</h3>\n<p>Admittedly, <a href=\"https://cssbattle.dev/\">CSSBattle</a> might be the only interactive learning tool in this list that has the potential to make you a <em>worse</em> developer! This one lets you do interactive challenges where the goal is to use pure CSS to replicate a given image with the least amount of code (i.e. \"code golf\"). You’ll definitely learn a lot about HTML and CSS with these exercises, but the techniques often won’t be useful in a real-world scenario.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6d609ba7-666a-4429-970d-ebd39753630b/cssbattle.png\" /></p>\n<h3>CSS Diner</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://flukeout.github.io/\">CSS Diner</a> is great for CSS beginners or those not familiar with advanced CSS selectors. This game allows you to use real CSS selectors on food items with a helpful HTML viewer so you can see the relationship between the graphics and the code.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/97f0a8ea-0d8b-4453-8c42-953ebcf1c591/css-diner.png\" /></p>\nTools To Learn JavaScript\n<h3>TypeScript Exercises</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://typescript-exercises.github.io/\">TypeScript Exercises</a> is an interactive playground for fiddling with different features of TypeScript, the popular JavaScript superset that has grown in popularity over the past few years. If you have a rudimentary understanding of TypeScript and want to expand on that, this app might work well for you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/107d8a85-0f96-4b27-9878-cd2d9faeb19a/typescript-exercises.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Design Patterns Game</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://designpatternsgame.com/\">Design Patterns Game</a> is unique and is not for JavaScript beginners. If you have a considerable amount of programming experience or are pretty adept with JavaScript in general, but have never really studied JavaScript design patterns, this might be a good place to start.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/186374e0-9a4d-4609-98d3-ae5a3b1e9038/designpatternsgame.png\" /></p>\n<h3>React Tutorial</h3>\n<p>There are lots of places to learn React nowadays and <a href=\"https://react-tutorial.app/\">React Tutorial</a> is another good option. What I like about this one is how it starts out with some JavaScript concepts that are important to understand in order to be more effective with React. Also, the in-page editor gives you autocomplete hints as well as hints to solve the challenges. Not all the lessons are free but there’s enough here to get you pretty deep into React’s fundamentals before paying.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c4be8e0a-79a2-4b7b-ab85-468e59087593/reacttutorial.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Elevator Saga</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.elevatorsaga.com/\">Elevator Saga</a> is quite different from many of the interactive tools in this list. This one allows you to use JavaScript to program the movement of elevators by means of a built-in API designed for the game itself. So you’ll not only brush up on your JavaScript but also on using a foreign API.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9b2af392-312a-4365-a30d-02b8a144ddf8/elevator-saga.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Screeps</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://screeps.com/\">Screeps</a> is an open-source massive multiplayer online real-time strategy game that lets you use real JavaScript code to build a colony, mine resources, conquer territory, and more. This one is quite advanced in its gameplay and comes highly recommended by a number of developers and teams.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e239fdc8-dfc9-40ea-9eb6-e9428ba2ff05/screeps.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Untrusted</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted/\">Untrusted</a> is a JavaScript adventure game where you have to guide a character called Dr. Eval through different mazes. You do so by changing and re-executing the code used for the current challenge to allow Dr. Eval to escape to the next one.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2f88c9ce-d10e-4211-8670-06622df47147/untrusted.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Promisees</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://bevacqua.github.io/promisees/\">Promisees</a> helps you learn a specific part of the ECMAScript spec – JavaScript Promises, a feature that was added to the language in ES6. You can use this little app to visualize how promises work and how they might be used in a real codebase.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7171b15e-a8a1-43bd-8144-8da718270bba/promisees.png\" /></p>\n<h3>JSchallenger</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jschallenger.com/\">JSchallenger</a> is a simple platform that lets you learn JavaScript by solving different coding challenges.

This video game-like environment goes through the service worker lifecycle, intercepting requests, working with caches, and more.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/82621f9f-3bf5-49b1-aaa8-3dfbb35c5d1b/service-workies.png\" /></p>\nTools To Learn Miscellaneous Web Dev Skills\n<h3>Learn Git Branching</h3>\n<p>Visuals are often lacking when learning command-line tools like Git. <a href=\"https://learngitbranching.js.org/\">Learn Git Branching</a> aims to solve that problem with a visual and interactive walk-through of the different features of Git using a Git repository visualizer, sandbox, and a series of educational tutorials and challenges.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8908bf97-70c9-4e9c-a6e0-c18814313247/gitbranching.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Select Star SQL</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://selectstarsql.com/\">Select Star SQL</a> allows you to learn SQL concepts.
