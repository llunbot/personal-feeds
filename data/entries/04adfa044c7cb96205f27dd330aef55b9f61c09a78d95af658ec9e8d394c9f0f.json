{"title":"Winspace T1600 – First Look and Mechanical Teardown","link":"https://www.hambini.com/winspace-t1600-first-look-and-mechanical-teardown/","date":1752833847000,"content":"The Winspace T1600 is a carbon aero frameset that offers serious engineering quality at a price that makes most Western brands look absurd. This review takes a detailed look at the frame from an actual engineering standpoint, not the usual vague “ride feel” commentary from influencers and shop mechanics. With clean internal routing, tight manufacturing tolerances, and consistent carbon layup, the T1600 delivers performance without the marketing fluff. I have been riding the frame extensively with no issues to report so far. Everything fits, everything works, and nothing creaks. It is designed by people who understand structural mechanics, not branding. Wind tunnel test results will be covered in the next video. If you are tired of being sold £4,000 frames based on Tour de France photos and buzzwords, the T1600 might be the reality check you need. Especially if you’re still taking advice from someone trying to crowdfund a bike shop refit.","author":"admin","siteTitle":"Hambini Engineering","siteHash":"1914e5a1ff85f6709ba64c29f2993b45bb8ae4b7452977e0a1f13e2e79329648","entryHash":"04adfa044c7cb96205f27dd330aef55b9f61c09a78d95af658ec9e8d394c9f0f","category":"Cycling"}
