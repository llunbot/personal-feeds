Instead, its new Body Geometry last includes a wider toe box, which it says allows the toes to splay, improving comfort and performance. Specialized isn’t the only brand to offer a wider forefoot last, with this being a feature of shoes from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/bont-vaypor-2023-road-cycling-shoe-review\">Bont </a>and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/lake-cx239-road-cycling-shoes-review\">Lake </a>among others.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Product_6-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Product_6-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Product_6-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Product_6-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Product_6-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Product_6-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Product_6-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Product_6-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Product_6-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Product_6-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Product_6.webp 2000w\" /><figcaption>Specialized </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized has a patented closure system for the Ares and has reworked how the forefoot is locked down, with the new design said to increase the foot-to-shoe contact area by 20%. It works with the new larger heel cup to reduce movement of the foot in the shoe and heel lift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s claimed that the redesign results in 44% less pressure on the forefoot and all the Body Geometry improvements add up to a seven watt boost to a rider’s lactate threshold.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+2\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-2-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-2-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-2-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-2-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-2-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-2-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-2-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-2-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is Body Geometry?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"489\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Infographic_1-970x489.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Infographic_1-970x489.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Infographic_1-300x151.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Infographic_1-768x387.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Infographic_1-1536x774.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Infographic_1-360x180.webp 360w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Infographic_1-750x378.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Infographic_1-1140x575.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Infographic_1.webp 2000w\" /><figcaption>Specialized </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Body Geometry is Specialized’s name for a diverse range of features that it applies to its equipment and clothing at the contact points. It’s designed to increase rider comfort and reduce the risk of injury. You’ll find the Body Geometry label applied to everything from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-road-bike-saddles\" target=\"_blank\">saddles </a>and seat pads to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-mitts-fingerless-gloves\" target=\"_blank\">gloves </a>and shoes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as its new last for the Ares 2 shoes, there are three other Body Geometry features that Specialized applies to its shoes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The varus wedge cants the footbed, so that the outer side of the foot is 1.5mm lower than the inner side. Specialized claims that this helps improve leg alignment through the knee and hip, which in turn increases power output and time to exhaustion by 10 seconds when going flat-out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The metatarsal button is a bump in the insole under the forefoot which helps to lift and splay out the bones, which Specialized says prevents nerve and arterial compression and helps avoid pain, numbness and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-problems-you-encounter-on-long-distance-cycling-events-and-the-best-ways-to-solve\">hot foot</a> while still promoting a secure fit for the shoe. It’s not unique to Specialized and is found in insoles from other brands including <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/quoc-escape-road-shoes-review\">Quoc</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/scott-road-comp-boa-review\">Scott </a>and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/lake-cx-177-road-cycling-shoes-review\">Lake</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third feature is longitudinal arch support. Specialized points out that when walking or running, the foot’s arch acts as a leaf spring, helping to absorb impact when the foot hits the ground and return it at the end of a stride. Since neither of these apply to cycling, Body Geometry soles and customisable insoles ensure rigid support for the foot’s arch, which Specialized claims prevents arch collapse and increases power delivery to the pedal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized claims that in sum, these Body Geometry features eliminate foot problems often experienced when riding, including forefoot numbness, hot foot, arch collapse, knee pain and foot instability. It says that these issues can compromise power, efficiency and stability as well as increasing the risk of injury.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike-shoes\">Best gravel bike shoes 2025 reviewed</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-budget-road-cycling-shoes\">Best budget cycling shoes reviewed 2025: Cheap clip-in shoes</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-shoes\">Best road cycling shoes 2025 reviewed and rated</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-fit-and-adjust-cleats-for-cycling-shoes\">Watch: How to fit and adjust cleats for cycling shoes</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-the-best-clipless-road-bike-pedals\">Best road bike pedals 2025 reviewed</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Sizes, colours and pricing</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Product_7-970x628.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Product_7-970x628.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Product_7-300x194.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Product_7-768x497.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Product_7-1536x994.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Product_7-750x485.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Product_7-1140x738.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_2_Product_7.webp 2000w\" /><figcaption>Specialized </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new S-Works Ares 2 shoes are available in full sizes from 36 to 49, with half sizes from 38.5 to 46.5.
