But in reality, that sounds more like a statement that they are Swiss Side’s most aero gravel wheels yet. And their real selling point is a balance of speed with relative affordability compared to some of the extravagant big name wheel launches..</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Swiss Side Gravon Carbon 500 aero gravel wheels get faster</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels-in-teh-GST-wind-tunnel-front-view-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1350\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels-in-teh-GST-wind-tunnel-front-view-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Swiss Side Gravon Carbon 500 aero gravel wheels in the GST wind tunnel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels-in-teh-GST-wind-tunnel-front-view-jpg.webp 1350w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels-in-teh-GST-wind-tunnel-front-view-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels-in-teh-GST-wind-tunnel-front-view-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels-in-teh-GST-wind-tunnel-front-view-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels-in-teh-GST-wind-tunnel-front-view-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels-in-teh-GST-wind-tunnel-front-view-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos &amp; Graphics/Swiss Side)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It was only two years ago that Swiss Side first introduced us to their Gravon <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/swiss-side-gravon-aero-gravel-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">aero gravel wheels</a>, co-developed with DT Swiss. And they combined their move into gravel bike aerodynamics with a wealth of data showing the Schwalbe G-One Speed to be the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/most-aero-gravel-tire/\" target=\"_blank\">most aero gravel tire</a> in their wind tunnel testing. In the meantime, DT Swiss completely revamped their aero gravel GRC lineup with a faster, lighter, and more expensive 50mm deep wheelset – developed in CFD and proven in the wind tunnel with Swiss Side expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And once again, it looks like Swiss Side has leveraged that DT collaboration to adapt the same new rim shape with a more affordable carbon layup and more conventional hubs &amp; spokes to save money while still going fast. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is the new Swiss Side Gravon Carbon 500, described as “<em>the most aerodynamic gravel wheelset designed for fast and efficient gravel rides</em>“. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Faster in the wind tunnel, but really not by much</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels_different-tire-size-comparison-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels_different-tire-size-comparison-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Swiss Side Gravon Carbon 500 aero gravel wheels, various tire size differnces\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels_different-tire-size-comparison-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels_different-tire-size-comparison-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels_different-tire-size-comparison-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels_different-tire-size-comparison-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels_different-tire-size-comparison-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels_different-tire-size-comparison-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how fast are the new Swiss Side Gravon Carbon 500 wheels really? Luckily, Swiss Side’s specialty is geeking out in the wind tunnel, so we’ve got <a href=\"https://www.swissside.com/blogs/news-blog/swiss-side-s-gravel-wheels-wind-tunnel-test-2024\" target=\"_blank\">plenty of graphs and comparisons</a> to see how they claim to have shaved off watts to make you faster. And with interesting results that oddly suggest that the aero gravel gains might not be all they are cracked up to be!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels_40mm-tire-comparison-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels_40mm-tire-comparison-jpg.webp\" alt=\"40mm tire comparison\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels_40mm-tire-comparison-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels_40mm-tire-comparison-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels_40mm-tire-comparison-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels_40mm-tire-comparison-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels_40mm-tire-comparison-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swiss-Side-Gravon-Carbon-500-aero-gravel-wheels_40mm-tire-comparison-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiss Side put the new 50mm deep aero gravel wheels head to head with the 42mm deep wheels that these replace, and their low-cost 25mm deep alloy wheels that carry over. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Swiss-Side-GRAVON-Carbon-500-aerodynamic-drag-comparison-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Swiss-Side-GRAVON-Carbon-500-aerodynamic-drag-comparison-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Swiss Side Gravon Carbon 500 aero gravel wheels, aerodynamic drag compaison\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Swiss-Side-GRAVON-Carbon-500-aerodynamic-drag-comparison-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Swiss-Side-GRAVON-Carbon-500-aerodynamic-drag-comparison-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Swiss-Side-GRAVON-Carbon-500-aerodynamic-drag-comparison-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Swiss-Side-GRAVON-Carbon-500-aerodynamic-drag-comparison-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Swiss-Side-GRAVON-Carbon-500-aerodynamic-drag-comparison-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Swiss-Side-GRAVON-Carbon-500-aerodynamic-drag-comparison-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All fitted with 40mm benchmark Schwalbe G-One tires in a Cervelo Aspero at a reasonable 30kph, the new Gravon Carbon 500 save a claimed 8% vs. the prior 420, getting most benefit when the wind comes in at an angle due to good ‘sailing effect’.
