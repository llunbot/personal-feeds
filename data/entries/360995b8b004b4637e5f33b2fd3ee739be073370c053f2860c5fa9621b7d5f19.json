The service is priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, and with that subscription price, all members of the family can access games. Apple also offers a one-month free trial for anyone, a three-month free trial for those who purchase an Apple device, and there are also often promotions for longer trial periods.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has been working with both indie developers and big name gaming companies on ‌Apple Arcade‌ titles since it launched, and in April of this year, Apple began <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/02/apple-arcade-adds-30-classic-games/\">re-releasing classic titles</a> like Fruit Ninja, Monument Valley, Mini Metro, Threes, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌Apple Arcade‌ titles can be played on iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple TVs, and many games are designed to support controllers, with support available for PlayStation and Xbox controllers. The service is available in more than 150 countries.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNew titles are added to ‌Apple Arcade‌ on a regular basis, and in the near future, the service <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/03/apple-arcade-masterchef-game-coming-soon/\">will be gaining</a> \"MasterChef: Let's Cook,\" \"Layton's Mystery Journey+,\" \"Asphalt Airborne 8+,\" \"Baldo The Guardian Owls,\" \"Tetris Beat,\" and \"Wurdweb.\"<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/\">Apple Arcade</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/06/apple-arcade-surpasses-200-games/\">Apple Arcade Surpasses 200 Games</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-arcade-surpasses-200-games.2306756/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lHHCZ1fGamY:IteJKU5ZVFc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lHHCZ1fGamY:IteJKU5ZVFc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/lHHCZ1fGamY\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"360995b8b004b4637e5f33b2fd3ee739be073370c053f2860c5fa9621b7d5f19","category":"Apple"}
