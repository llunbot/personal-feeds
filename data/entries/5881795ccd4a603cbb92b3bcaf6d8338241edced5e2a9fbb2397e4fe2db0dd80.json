This will give you the circumference of your head, which will dictate the size of helmet you need.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Once you have chosen the correct size helmet, you can fine-tune fit with the adjusters.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>You’ll be able to fine-tune the fit later, but getting the right size to start is key.</p>\n<h2>Choosing the right type of helmet</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some helmets, including urban helmets, have a peak.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>For some disciplines, getting the right type of helmet will offer more protection.</p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-helmets-for-trail-riding/\">mountain biking helmets</a> not only have a peak to protect you from low branches and some weather, but also typically come down lower around the back of the head for extra protection.</p>\n<p>Some urban helmets may also feature visors, to help keep glare and rain out of your eyes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-helmets/\">Road cycling helmets</a> don’t have visors because they could potentially limit your field of vision when riding in a more aggressive position on the drops.</p>\n<h2>How to wear a bike helmet correctly</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Make sure you loosen off any securing systems before putting the helmet on your head.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Katherine Moore / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Before putting the bike helmet on your head, loosen off any straps or ratchets so it sits onto your head easily.</p>\n<p>Once on, and set up level on your head, you can secure and adjust the features to fit – the front of the helmet should be one to two finger-widths above your brow.</p>\n<h3>Adjusting the fit of a helmet</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Use the ratchet to fine-tune the fit around the circumference of the head.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Katherine Moore / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>To fit and secure the helmet, tighten the ratchet system so the helmet fits snugly around the circumference of your head, with minimal movement when you shake your head, but not so tight that it feels uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>Remember, you’ll be able to adjust this on the go, too.</p>\n<h3>Setting up the straps on a helmet</h3>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/06/how-to-wear-a-helmet-safely-and-correctly-21-6ff73e2.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Ensure there’s enough slack in the chin strap to keep it comfortable, but not too much.

Many helmets have an elastic fitting where you can secure any loose end of strap webbing under the chin, too.</p>\n<p>Once you’re happy with the fit of the straps, it’s unlikely that you’ll need to adjust these regularly, unless you’re wearing different headgear or hairstyles that significantly affect the fit.</p>\n<h2>How not to wear a helmet</h2>\n<p>There are a few common pitfalls when it comes to wearing a cycling helmet…</p>\n<h3>Don’t wear the helmet too far back on your head</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A helmet fitted too far back will not only be uncomfortable but could seriously compromise its function when you need it most.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Katherine Moore / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The first is wearing the helmet too far back on the head, tilted back with a lot of your forehead exposed, rather than sat level on the top of the head.</p>\n<h3>Make sure the helmet actually fits you</h3>\n<p>A helmet that’s sized too small can be really uncomfortable, or even not sit on the head properly at all, and a helmet that’s sized too big can roll about and most importantly not protect you as it should in the event of an accident.</p>\n<h3>Don’t wear a thick hat underneath your helmet</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Wearing a thick hat may mean that the helmet sits too high on your head, making it unsafe to wear.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Katherine Moore / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>It may be tempting on a really cold day to wear a thick hat under your helmet, but if this means that the helmet doesn’t fit onto your head properly, it’s not a safe move.</p>\n<p>Thinner hats or ear coverings are a much better idea.</p>\n<h3>Safely stow hair</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some helmets have ports in the mechanisms that allow you to fit a ponytail or plait through.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Katherine Moore / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>For riders with a lot of hair, you may need to reconsider your hairstyle to make sure your helmet fits well.</p>\n<p>Some helmets allow a ponytail or plait to fit through the mechanism at the back.</p>\n<h3>Make sure the straps are correctly adjusted</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Adjust the chin strap so it sits snugly against your jaw without being restrictive.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If your helmet straps are too loose, then the helmet is less likely to stay in the optimal position to protect you when you need it most and the same goes for not doing up the chin strap at all.</p>\n<h3>Don’t wear your helmet back to front</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Make sure you get the orientation of your helmet correct, with the mechanism at the back. You may laugh but this is a surprisingly common mistake!</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kathering Moore / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Lastly, make sure that you have the orientation of the helmet correct front to back.</p>\n<p>The back is often a little lower than the front to protect the skull and may feature an adjustment system that the front will not.</p>","author":"Katherine Moore","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"5881795ccd4a603cbb92b3bcaf6d8338241edced5e2a9fbb2397e4fe2db0dd80","category":"Cycling"}
