I was able to get a hold of one of their clever tail lights recently, the <a href=\"https://ridepdw.com/collections/tail-lights/products/gravity-plus-usb-tail-light\" target=\"_blank\">Gravity Plus USB Tail Light</a>. This is a cool, unique tail light that has an accelerometer built right into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-close-up-e1739213780585.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-close-up-e1739213780585.webp\" alt=\"PDW Gravity Plus Tail Light close up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-close-up-e1739213780585.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-close-up-e1739213780585-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-close-up-e1739213780585-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-close-up-e1739213780585-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Having an accelerometer built into the light simply means the accelerometer will detect deceleration and automatically activate a second, super bright, solid beam light to warn following traffic that you’re slowing down. This same brighter light will also come on if you make any abrupt motion, like swerving to escape a road hazard, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clips-e1739213822756.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"772\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clips-e1739213822756.webp\" alt=\"PDW Gravity Plus Tail Light clips\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clips-e1739213822756.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clips-e1739213822756-297x179.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clips-e1739213822756-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clips-e1739213822756-768x463.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gravity Plus is a great idea executed in a small, handsome package. It’s bigger than my old “go-to” battery-powered rear light, but not so big that it looks cumbersome or unsightly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the other cool things about this tail light is that the Gravity Plus has a pretty long battery life of up to 30 hours of use in flash mode (80 lumens), or 12 hours in solid mode (20 lumens). When the brighter “brake light” comes on it blazes at a very bright 100 lumens.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>In Use</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-slide-clip-in.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-slide-clip-in.webp\" alt=\"PDW Gravity Plus Tail Light slide clip in\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-slide-clip-in.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-slide-clip-in-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-slide-clip-in-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-slide-clip-in-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clipped-in.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clipped-in.webp\" alt=\"PDW Gravity Plus Tail Light clipped in\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clipped-in.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clipped-in-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clipped-in-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clipped-in-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clip-in-mount.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clip-in-mount.webp\" alt=\"PDW Gravity Plus Tail Light clip in mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clip-in-mount.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clip-in-mount-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clip-in-mount-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clip-in-mount-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clipped-and-ready-to-mount.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clipped-and-ready-to-mount.webp\" alt=\"PDW Gravity Plus Tail Light clipped and ready to mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clipped-and-ready-to-mount.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clipped-and-ready-to-mount-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clipped-and-ready-to-mount-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clipped-and-ready-to-mount-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I chose to mount the Gravity Plus on my seatpost. Mounting is easy. Just snap the clip to the back of the light and clip the light to the mount. Then fasten the mount to your desired location.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clipped-into-seatpost-mount.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clipped-into-seatpost-mount.webp\" alt=\"PDW Gravity Plus Tail Light clipped into seatpost mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clipped-into-seatpost-mount.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clipped-into-seatpost-mount-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clipped-into-seatpost-mount-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-clipped-into-seatpost-mount-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To allow the Gravity Plus accelerometer to calibrate properly, you have to install the light on your bike <em>before</em> turning the light on. Once it’s mounted to the bike, simply press and hold the power button for 1 second. After that, keep the bike still for another second. This will complete the calibration.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-usb-c-charging-port.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-usb-c-charging-port.webp\" alt=\"PDW Gravity Plus Tail Light usb c charging port\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-usb-c-charging-port.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-usb-c-charging-port-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-usb-c-charging-port-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-usb-c-charging-port-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The light uses a rechargeable li-polymer battery. It uses USB-C to recharge and comes with a charging cord. The exterior of the Gravity Plus is ready for all-season riding. The charging port is also fully encased and weatherproof to keep the nasty elements out of that area.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-mounted-on-fanny-pack.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-mounted-on-fanny-pack.webp\" alt=\"PDW Gravity Plus Tail Light mounted on fanny pack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-mounted-on-fanny-pack.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-mounted-on-fanny-pack-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-mounted-on-fanny-pack-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-mounted-on-fanny-pack-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Mounted to my hip pack for MTB night rides!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gravity Plus comes with ways to mount the light to a seatpost or a backpack. It can be mounted vertically or horizontally. I use it mounted to the seatpost in a vertical orientation. The tool-less mounting makes it easy to use on multiple bikes, or take it with you to prevent the light from being stolen after locking your bike up.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-mounted-from-side.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-mounted-from-side.webp\" alt=\"PDW Gravity Plus Tail Light mounted from side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-mounted-from-side.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-mounted-from-side-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-mounted-from-side-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-mounted-from-side-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s an awesome product, by a company that focuses on the everyday needs of the average cyclist. Not to mention PDW is a member of <a href=\"https://ridepdw.com/pages/for-the-planet\" target=\"_blank\">1% For the Planet</a>. This means that each year, PDW donates 1% of its top-of-the-line revenue to nonprofit organizations working to protect our planet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-from-the-back.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-from-the-back.webp\" alt=\"PDW Gravity Plus Tail Light from the back\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-from-the-back.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-from-the-back-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-from-the-back-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PDW-Gravity-Plus-Tail-Light-from-the-back-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, for the price (see below), the Gravity Plus is an attainable solution that will help keep you safer while riding.
