Saint-Exupéry is taking on his fourth TCR, and is hoping to improve on his fifth place last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saint-Exupéry, who by day is a bike messenger, has been vocal in encouraging riders to be more conscious of their environmental footprint, and to take trains and boats instead of planes, and in some cases, ride, to races.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has used trains and boats to get to and from every TCR he has done so far, and for this year’s TCR Saint-Exupéry caught a train from his home in Lausanne to Brussels and rode 50km to the start line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, TCR organisers, Lost Dot, introduced a Green Leaderboard and a Low Carbon Travel Fund for TCRno9. 78 riders committed to travelling to and from the race without flying, and Lost Dot offered a £250 grant for 10 riders to make travelling overland more accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saint-Exupéry is currently head down racing the TCR, but we caught up with him just before he set off.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>This is your fourth TCR, why do you keep coming back?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/TCRNo9-_-Transcontinental-Race-Start-029-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/TCRNo9-_-Transcontinental-Race-Start-029-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/TCRNo9-_-Transcontinental-Race-Start-029-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/TCRNo9-_-Transcontinental-Race-Start-029-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/TCRNo9-_-Transcontinental-Race-Start-029-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/TCRNo9-_-Transcontinental-Race-Start-029-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/TCRNo9-_-Transcontinental-Race-Start-029-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/TCRNo9-_-Transcontinental-Race-Start-029-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/TCRNo9-_-Transcontinental-Race-Start-029-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/TCRNo9-_-Transcontinental-Race-Start-029-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/TCRNo9-_-Transcontinental-Race-Start-029.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption>Transcontinental / Liz Seabrook, Tomas Montes </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Saint-Exupéry:</strong> ‘I’ve progressed every year and I can feel myself getting stronger.

The TCR is the race which made me fall in love with ultra racing and to see it create these initiatives which are super important makes me really happy. I hope it will encourage more people to cycle to races, to get trains and boats, rather than take an airplane.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Even if a few people start doing it, it can change mentalities slowly and encourage other people to ask themselves why they need to fly to a race. Obviously you want to travel the world and discover new things, but it’s important to make people conscious of the carbon footprint of flying and also show that riding to a race is a nice beginning.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is your strategy for TCRno9?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/marin-de-st-exupery-credit-rupert-hartley-3-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/marin-de-st-exupery-credit-rupert-hartley-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/marin-de-st-exupery-credit-rupert-hartley-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/marin-de-st-exupery-credit-rupert-hartley-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/marin-de-st-exupery-credit-rupert-hartley-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/marin-de-st-exupery-credit-rupert-hartley-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/marin-de-st-exupery-credit-rupert-hartley-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/marin-de-st-exupery-credit-rupert-hartley-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/marin-de-st-exupery-credit-rupert-hartley-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/marin-de-st-exupery-credit-rupert-hartley-3-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/marin-de-st-exupery-credit-rupert-hartley-3.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Rupert Hartley</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Saint-Exupéry:</strong> <strong>‘</strong>I don’t have a strategy.

It’s not inspiring everyday mobility and I think that’s a shame, as cycling can do so much for this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I was recently at the Wish One Gravel Race in Milau, France. The main sponsor of the event was Total so I had prepared to wear a cycling jersey which said ‘the bike does not need fuel’. I was given the mic and chose to speak about greenwashing in the industry. I think everyone was surprised but it’s super important, cycling deserves so much better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It made me think what a real pro could do if they took the mic and spoke about it.
