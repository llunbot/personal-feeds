Well, I’m based in Singapore, and it’s mostly summer here. But, June is a special month here as it marks the start of durian season.</p> \n<p>Starting next week, I’ll be travelling to Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines. But before I go, I want to share some interesting updates from last week for you.</p> \n<p>Let’s get started.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Last Week’s Launches</strong></span><br /> Here are some launches that caught my attention:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/generative-ai-with-large-language-models-new-hands-on-course-by-deeplearning-ai-and-aws/\"><strong>New Hands-on Course: Generative AI with Large Language Models</strong></a> – Generative AI has been a technology highlight for the past few months. If you are on your journey to learn large language models (LLM), then you can try the new hands-on course <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-with-llms/\">Generative AI with LLMs</a> at Coursera. Antje wrote a post to announce this collaboration course between DeepLearning.AI and AWS. This course is designed to prepare data scientists and engineers to become experts in selecting, training, fine-tuning, and deploying LLMs for real-world applications.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/06/26/generative-ai-with-llms-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/06/26/generative-ai-with-llms-1-1024x512.png\" alt=\"Generative AI with large language models\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/accelerate-time-to-business-insights-with-the-amazon-sagemaker-data-wrangler-direct-connection-to-snowflake/\"><strong>Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler direct connection to Snowflake</strong></a> – With this announcement, you can now browse databases, tables, schemas, and query data from Snowflake in SageMaker Data Wrangler. This unlocks the possibility for you to join your data with other popular data sources, such as S3, Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift, Amazon EMR and over 50 SaaS applications to create the right data set for machine learning.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2023/06/23/sf_dw_1.png\" width=\"879\" height=\"512\" /></p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/role-manager-tutorial-cdk.html\">Amazon SageMaker Role Manager now provides CDK library to create fine-grained permissions</a></strong> — The CDK support for Amazon SageMaker Role Manager lets you define permissions with fine-grained access for SageMaker users, jobs, and SageMaker pipelines programmatically. This will reduce manual efforts and consistent permissions management. For example, the following code grants permissions with a set of related machine learning activities specific to a persona.</p> \n<pre><code>\nexport class myCDKStack extends cdk.Stack {\n  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {\n    super(scope, id, props);\n\n    const persona = new Persona(this, 'example-persona-id', {\n        activities: [\n            Activity.runStudioAppsV2(this, 'example-id1', {}), \n            Activity.accessS3Buckets(this, 'example-id2', {s3buckets: [s3.S3Bucket.fromBucketName('DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET')]}) \n            Activity.accessAwsServices(this, 'example-id3', {})\n        ]\n    });\n\n    const role = persona.createRole(this, 'example-IAM-role-id', 'example-IAM-role-name');\n    \n    }\n}                                   \n                </code></pre> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/awsforsap/getting-started-with-aws-sdk-for-sap-abap/\">AWS SDK for SAP ABAP</a></strong> – Great news for SAP ABAP developers! We just recently announced the general availability of the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-sap-abap/\">AWS SDK for SAP ABAP</a>. With this, ABAP developers can use simple, secure and configurable connections between ABAP environments and 200+ supported AWS services in all AWS Regions, including AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. This AWS SDK helps ABAP developers to modernize their business processes with AWS services.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/17ba0791499db908433b80f37c5fbc89b870084b/2023/06/29/AWS-SDK-for-SAP-ABAP-Architecture.png\" width=\"1170\" height=\"547\" /></p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/configure-client.html#configure-client-security-lake\">Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion now supports ingesting events from Amazon Security Lake</a></strong> – Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion now lets you bring data in the Apache Parquet format.
