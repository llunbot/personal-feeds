They can be in a Family Sharing group or anyone at all. You can even invite people <em>without</em> an iCloud account, who will then be invited to create one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, readers have reported (and I’ve seen) that invitations sometimes aren’t delivered or don’t work, no matter what you try. Here’s typically how you would share and send an invitation within the Calendar app in macOS 15 Sequoia:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new iCloud calendar (<em>File &gt; New Calendar &gt; iCloud</em>) or select an existing one in the sidebar.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hover over the right side of the calendar listing, and an icon of a silhouetted head and shoulders within a circle appears. Click it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the <em>Share With</em> field, start typing a name or email address and then click it to autocomplete. You can also paste in email addresses.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click <em>Done</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-share-calendar-1-bordered.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-share-calendar-1-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1198w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-share-calendar-1-bordered.png?resize=300%2C190&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-share-calendar-1-bordered.png?resize=768%2C487&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"650\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>You can share any iCloud calendar.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-share-calendar-invite-sbs.png?w=1200\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-share-calendar-invite-sbs.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1287w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-share-calendar-invite-sbs.png?resize=300%2C143&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-share-calendar-invite-sbs.png?resize=768%2C367&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-share-calendar-invite-sbs.png?resize=1200%2C573&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"573\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Invite someone (left); once they have accepted the invitation, they appear with a green checkmark.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>iCloud now sends invitations to all the parties listed and provides push notifications to their devices if they have notifications enabled for Calendar. They should receive an email message with a <em>Join Calendar</em> link they can click or tap, which will take them to iCloud.com to log in and accept the invitation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that email doesn’t arrive or using the link doesn’t work, here is the workaround, which is a perfectly acceptable pathway to accept an invitation:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Have the invited party log in to iCloud.com with the account you used for their invitation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click the Calendar icon.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click the inbox icon, which should have the numeral 1 or a larger numeral overlaid on it as a badge.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Under the invitation notification, click <em>Join</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-share-calendar-email-invite-com-sbs.png?w=1200\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-share-calendar-email-invite-com-sbs.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-share-calendar-email-invite-com-sbs.png?resize=300%2C122&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-share-calendar-email-invite-com-sbs.png?resize=768%2C313&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-share-calendar-email-invite-com-sbs.png?resize=1200%2C490&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"490\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>An email invitation should appear in the recipient’s inbox (left).
