{"title":"New – Amazon EC2 M6i Instances Powered by the Latest-Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-m6i-instances-powered-by-the-latest-generation-intel-xeon-scalable-processors/","date":1629149230000,"content":"<p>Last year, we introduced the sixth generation of EC2 instances powered by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/\">AWS-designed Graviton2</a> processors. We’re now expanding our sixth-generation offerings to include <strong>x86-based instances</strong>, delivering price/performance benefits for workloads that rely on x86 instructions.</p> \n<p>Today, I am happy to announce the availability of the new general purpose <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m6i/\"><strong>Amazon EC2 M6i instances</strong></a>, which offer up to <strong>15%</strong> improvement in price/performance versus comparable fifth-generation instances. The new instances are powered by the latest generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors (code-named Ice Lake) with an all-core turbo frequency of <strong>3.5 GHz</strong>.</p> \n<p>You might have noticed that we’re now using the “<strong>i</strong>” suffix in the instance type to specify that the instances are using an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/intel/\">Intel processor</a>. We already use the suffix “<strong>a</strong>” for <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/amd/\">AMD processors</a> (for example, M5a instances) and “<strong>g</strong>” for <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/\">Graviton processors</a> (for example, M6g instances).</p> \n<p>Compared to M5 instances using an Intel processor, this new instance type provides:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>A larger instance size (<strong>m6i.32xlarge</strong>) with 128 vCPUs and 512 GiB of memory that makes it easier and more cost-efficient to consolidate workloads and scale up applications.</li> \n <li>Up to <strong>15%</strong> improvement in compute price/performance.</li> \n <li>Up to <strong>20%</strong> higher memory bandwidth.</li> \n <li>Up to <strong>40 Gbps</strong> for <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/\">Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)</a> and <strong>50 Gbps</strong> for networking.</li> \n <li>Always-on <strong>memory encryption</strong>.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>M6i instances are a good fit for running general-purpose workloads such as web and application servers, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/containers/\">containerized</a> applications, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/microservices/\">microservices</a>, and small data stores. The higher memory bandwidth is especially useful for enterprise applications, such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sap/solutions/saphana/\">SAP HANA</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/\">high performance computing (HPC) workloads</a>, such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/cfd/\">computational fluid dynamics (CFD)</a>.</p> \n<p>M6i instances are also <strong>SAP-certified</strong>. For over eight years SAP customers have been relying on the Amazon EC2 M-family of instances for their mission critical SAP workloads. With M6i instances, customers can achieve up to <strong>15%</strong> better price/performance for SAP applications than M5 instances.</p> \n<p>M6i instances are available in <strong>nine sizes</strong> (the <strong>m6i.metal</strong> size is coming soon):</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Name</td> \n   <td>vCPUs</td> \n   <td>Memory<br /> (GiB)</td> \n   <td>Network Bandwidth<br /> (Gbps)</td> \n   <td>EBS Throughput<br /> (Gbps)</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m6i.large</strong></td> \n   <td>2</td> \n   <td>8</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m6i.xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>4</td> \n   <td>16</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m6i.2xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>8</td> \n   <td>32</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m6i.4xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>16</td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m6i.8xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>32</td> \n   <td>128</td> \n   <td>12.5</td> \n   <td>10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m6i.12xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>48</td> \n   <td>192</td> \n   <td>18.75</td> \n   <td>15</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m6i.16xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>256</td> \n   <td>25</td> \n   <td>20</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m6i.24xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>96</td> \n   <td>384</td> \n   <td>37.5</td> \n   <td>30</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m6i.32xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>128</td> \n   <td>512</td> \n   <td>50</td> \n   <td>40</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>The new instances are built on the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/\">AWS Nitro System</a>, which is a collection of building blocks that offloads many of the traditional <strong>virtualization</strong> functions to dedicated <strong>hardware</strong>, delivering high performance, high availability, and highly secure cloud instances.</p> \n<p>For optimal networking performance on these new instances, upgrade your Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) drivers to version 3.
