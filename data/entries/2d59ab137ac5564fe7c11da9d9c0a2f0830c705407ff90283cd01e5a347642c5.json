Despite this 20-year-old hardware, my brother was able to achieve inference with Meta's LLM model Llama 2 on the laptop.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe experiment involved porting the open-source llama2.c project, and then accelerating performance with a PowerPC vector extension called AltiVec.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHis <a href=\"http://www.theresistornetwork.com/2025/03/thinking-different-thinking-slowly-llms.html\">full blog post</a> offers more technical details about the project.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSimilar examples of generative AI models running <a href=\"https://x.com/AndreiDavid/status/1874079931958956364\">on the PlayStation 3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/user-runs-an-ai-model-on-an-xbox-360-3-core-powerpc-with-512-mb-memory-handles-an-ai-model-based-on-llama2-c\">Xbox 360</a>, and other old devices have surfaced in the news from time to time.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/powerbook-g4-generative-ai/\">Software Engineer Runs Generative AI on 20-Year-Old PowerBook G4</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/software-engineer-runs-generative-ai-on-20-year-old-powerbook-g4.2453980/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2d59ab137ac5564fe7c11da9d9c0a2f0830c705407ff90283cd01e5a347642c5","category":"Apple"}
