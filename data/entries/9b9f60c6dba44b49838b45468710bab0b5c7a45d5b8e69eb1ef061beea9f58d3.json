I am not being paid to promote this product. But it transformed my experience of using AirPods Pro so much that I want you to know about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comply foam tips, which <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088KPNKN2/\">generally sell for around $20 on Amazon</a>, make my AirPods Pro 2 more comfortable, more secure, and better sounding. I literally use them more often because of these tips, and when I eventually get AirPods Pro 3, the first thing I’ll do is slap a new set of Comply foam tips on them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple knows that people have different ears, which is why it offers several AirPods Pro ear tips for different ear shapes. But they’re just hollow silicone flanges, which isn’t ideal for all ears. <a href=\"https://www.complyfoam.com/collections/all-products/products/premium-ear-tips-for-apple-airpods-pro\">Comply</a> (and a few other companies) make really excellent replacement tips that are made of memory foam. They attach just like Apple tips—just pop off the ones on your AirPods Pro and snap on the foam tips in their place. They fit as securely as the AirPods Pro’s ear tips and don’t interfere with their fit in the charging case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The memory foam shapes to the contours of your ear and are denser than that little silicone flap, so it forms a better seal. This slightly improves sound quality (especially on the low end) and is better at blocking out more outside noise, which in turn makes active noise canceling more effective.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/airpods-pro-comply.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"AirPods Pro 2 Comply foam tips\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/airpods-pro-comply.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3317w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/airpods-pro-comply.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/airpods-pro-comply.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/airpods-pro-comply.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/airpods-pro-comply.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/airpods-pro-comply.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/airpods-pro-comply.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/airpods-pro-comply.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>These little foam replacement tips are a huge improvement to my AirPods Pro 2.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But they’re also more comfortable to wear for long periods and help the earbuds stay in place, which is a frequent problem for me—with Apple’s eartips, no matter which size I choose, one or both earbuds eventually work themselves loose if I’m doing something active like yardwork or working out at the gym. With the Comply foam tips, they never come loose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tips come in sets of three pairs. At first, you buy a set where you get one small, medium, and large pair. Once you’ve found your size, you can buy three of the same size when you need a new set. Which brings us to the downside of these tips: You need to replace them after a few months of daily wear as the memory foam eventually starts to break down and wear out. So it’s good that you get three pairs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One set of $20 ear tips will last for a year or so of daily use. It’s a small price to pay for AirPods Pro which are more secure, comfortable, and sound better. If your AirPods Pro aren’t entirely comfortable, give them a chance—you’ll never want to use your AirPods Pro without them again.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>AirPods Pro 2 USB-C</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1218\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/61sRKTAfrhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AirPods Pro 2 USB-C\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/61sRKTAfrhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1218w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/61sRKTAfrhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=244%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 244w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/61sRKTAfrhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=768%2C946&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/61sRKTAfrhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=974%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 974w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1207444/airpods-pro-2-review-2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$249\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHWRXH8B?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">$239 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTJV3AM/A/airpods-pro\" target=\"_blank\">$249 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9b9f60c6dba44b49838b45468710bab0b5c7a45d5b8e69eb1ef061beea9f58d3","category":"Apple"}
