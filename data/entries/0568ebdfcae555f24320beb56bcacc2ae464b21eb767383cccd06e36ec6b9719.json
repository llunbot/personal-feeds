The Dogma XC Hardtail follows the release of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-pinarello-dogma-xc/\">full-suspension Dogma</a> in May.</p>\n<p>The bike is said to have been designed with input from Ineos Grenadiers riders Tom Pidcock and Pauline Ferrand-Prévot, is designed around a 100mm fork, and features a very unusual bottom bracket shell.</p>\n<h2>What’s going on with that bottom bracket?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pinarello-Dogma-XC-bottom-bracket\" title=\"Pinarello-Dogma-XC-bottom-bracket\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Just like the full-suspension Dogma XC, the hardtail features an eye-catching BB.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>Just like its full-suspension stablemate, the new Dogma XC hardtail is designed around an unusual bottom bracket junction.</p>\n<p>A small strut connects the down tube to the seat tube, creating a third triangle at the base of the seat tube. Pinarello says this design improves pedalling stiffness.</p>\n<h2>Asymmetric frame</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pinarello-Dogma-XC-rear-triangle\" title=\"Pinarello-Dogma-XC-rear-triangle\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Dogma XC hardtail takes Pinarello’s signature asymmetric frame design to another level</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>The Dogma XC hardtail also inherits Pinarello’s signature asymmetric rear triangle.</p>\n<p>The left-hand side (non-drive side) of the rear triangle is reinforced, which, according to Pinarello’s claims, enables the bike to counter-balance the forces put into the drivetrain for a more balanced energy transfer.</p>\n<p>The Dogma XC hardtail has taken this design even further, employing visible asymmetries in the seat stays and chain stays.</p>\n<h2>Integrated cockpit</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pinarello-Dogma-XC-cockpit\" title=\"Pinarello-Dogma-XC-cockpit\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A one-piece carbon cockpit promises to keep things light and stiff</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>The Dogma’s cockpit is made of carbon and features a one-piece integrated design and internal cable routing.</p>\n<p>To prevent the cockpit from damaging the frame in the event of a crash, the Dogma hardtail’s headset features an internal steering lock.</p>\n<h2>Dropper post compatible</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pinarello-Dogma-XC\" title=\"Pinarello-Dogma-XC\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Dogma XC Hardtail is dropper post-compatible.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>With modern cross-country race courses getting ever more technical and demanding, it’s perhaps no surprise to see the new Dogma XC hardtail boasting dropper post compatibility.</p>\n<p>The frame uses a 30.9mm seat tube and has internal cable routing, should you want to fit a dropper.</p>\n<h2>Pricing, specs and availability</h2>\n<p>Pinarello is yet to release any information regarding the pricing, specifications and availability of the new Dogma XC hardtail.</p>\n<p>Currently, the new bike is being exclusively ridden by Tom Pidcock and Pauline Ferrand-Prévot.
