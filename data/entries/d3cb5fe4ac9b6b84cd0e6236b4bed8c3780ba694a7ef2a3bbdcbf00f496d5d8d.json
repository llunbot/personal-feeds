It says that foam-only pads tend to lose support over longer rides, particularly if they get wet, while its gel pad won’t collapse if it does get wet.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Poc-Novus-seat-pad-pressure-mapping-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Poc-Novus-seat-pad-pressure-mapping-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Poc-Novus-seat-pad-pressure-mapping-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Poc-Novus-seat-pad-pressure-mapping-768x513.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Poc-Novus-seat-pad-pressure-mapping-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Poc-Novus-seat-pad-pressure-mapping-750x501.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Poc-Novus-seat-pad-pressure-mapping-1140x761.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Poc-Novus-seat-pad-pressure-mapping-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Poc-Novus-seat-pad-pressure-mapping-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Poc-Novus-seat-pad-pressure-mapping-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Poc-Novus-seat-pad-pressure-mapping.webp 1909w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Poc’s research included pressure mapping on a range of rider tyres, ride position, saddles, conditions and ride times. The brand says that it also collaborated with experts in physiotherapy, gynaecology and bike fit to work on the new pad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conclusion from its current and prior research was that the new pad needed to be wider, as the pressure areas consistently exceeded the width of most pads. It also should be more ventilated than is typical, as well as being different for men and women, as women’s sit bones are typically 10mm to 20mm wider than men’s. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poc has also found that saddle cut-outs increase pressure at the front of the saddle and that men in general put less pressure on the front of the saddle than women riders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amateur riders showed significant changes in pressure distribution dependent on the pad used and when riding on the hoods versus in the drops, while for pro riders pressure distribution was similar regardless of the pad. Poc interprets this finding as showing that technique and training are important in optimising saddle comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+4\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-4-1-970x300.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-4-1-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-4-1-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-4-1-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-4-1-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-4-1-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-4-1-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-4-1-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>New shorts, jerseys and socks</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Novus_Chamois_1-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Novus_Chamois_1-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Novus_Chamois_1-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Novus_Chamois_1-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Novus_Chamois_1-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Novus_Chamois_1-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Novus_Chamois_1-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Novus_Chamois_1-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Novus_Chamois_1-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Novus_Chamois_1-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Novus_Chamois_1-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Novus seat pad is incorporated in Poc’s new bib shorts, along with new four-way stretch fabrics, wider bibs and flatlocked sewn seams.
