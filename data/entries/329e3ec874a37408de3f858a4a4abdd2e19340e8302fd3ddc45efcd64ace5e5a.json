{"title":"The Wall Street Journal on Apple’s Plans for iOS Sideloading in the E.U.","link":"https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-plans-new-fees-and-restrictions-for-downloads-outside-app-store-f464f426?mod=hp_lista_pos1","date":1706136688000,"content":"\n<p>Aaron Tilley, Salvador Rodriguez, Sam Schechner, and Kim Mackrael, reporting for The Wall Street Journal (<a href=\"https://apple.news/AoSzTgHGXSpKQnmjAQTcSig\">News+ link</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Meta Platforms, Spotify and other companies are preparing new \ndownload options for customers in anticipation of the new rules. \nMeta is considering a system that would allow people to download \napps directly from Facebook ads. Spotify plans to offer users the \nability to download some of its iPhone apps directly from its \nwebsite, according to the company. Microsoft has weighed a launch \nof its own third-party app store for games in the past. [...] </p>\n\n<p>Apple’s approach to the EU law will help ensure the company \nmaintains close oversight of apps downloaded outside the App \nStore, a process known as sideloading. The company will give \nitself the ability to review each app downloaded outside of its \nApp Store. Apple also plans to collect fees from developers that \noffer downloads outside of the App Store, said people familiar \nwith the company’s plans. The company hasn’t yet announced its \nplans and they could change. </p>\n\n<p>The restrictions and fees could renew tensions with app \ndevelopers, some of whom had expected the new law to allow them to \ndeliver their apps to users free of Apple’s restrictions or what \nthey see as a high commission. The new European law “is a \nregulation with teeth, with the possibility to apply fines and \nwith a possibility for the commission to have powers of \ninvestigation,” said Olivia Regnier, a senior director of European \npolicy at Spotify. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Journal story is light on details, but it sounds like Apple is planning for a system largely like last week’s <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/coming_to_grips_with_apples_seemingly_unshakable_sense_of_app_store_entitlement\">External Purchase Link entitlement</a>, where developers will still be on the hook to pay Apple 27/12 percent commissions. How will this review process work for apps that aren’t distributed through the App Store?</p>\n\n<p>I’ve considered it very odd from the start that the DMA is not clear at all about this. And here we are on the cusp of it going into effect, and we still seemingly have no idea whether the European Commission and Apple see eye to eye on what the DMA demands for compliance.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, the most strident critics of Apple’s App Store policies believe that the DMA requires opening iOS to something akin to how the Mac works: where the App Store is one method of software distribution, but users are free to simply download apps directly from developers’ websites, so long as those apps are signed. According to the Journal, Apple is planning to announce something not like that at all.</p>\n\n<p>I have a feeling that fireworks are going to fly when Apple announces their compliance plans, but I don’t know. Maybe Apple has shared their plans in detail with the EC and the EC is fine with it. But if that’s the case, I don’t see how the DMA “has teeth” when it comes to sideloading.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/24/wsj-apple-sideloading\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"329e3ec874a37408de3f858a4a4abdd2e19340e8302fd3ddc45efcd64ace5e5a","category":"Tech"}
