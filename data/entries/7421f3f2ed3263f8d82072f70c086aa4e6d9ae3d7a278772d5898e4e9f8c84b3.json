Built for long hauls, dry miles, and dusty grinds, it’s a 5-liter gear hauler that wears light, breathes easily, and feels like a nice hug. With two zippered chest pockets perfectly sized for snacks or that oversized phone you definitely won’t be checking mid-ride, and two drop pockets for fast-grab items, The Saguaro keeps your essentials tight to your body without the dreaded bounce.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/SanUtilVestStudioShoot-31.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/SanUtilVestStudioShoot-31.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/SanUtilVestStudioShoot-31.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/SanUtilVestStudioShoot-31.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/SanUtilVestStudioShoot-27.webp?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/SanUtilVestStudioShoot-27.webp?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/SanUtilVestStudioShoot-27.webp?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/SanUtilVestStudioShoot-27.webp?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Around back, there’s a dedicated sleeve for a 2L Hydrapak bladder — and a separate main cargo zone with side access, so your zipper isn’t caked in rear-tire mud halfway through the day. Two side-access organizer pockets make gear sorting easy, and a key clip keeps your truck key out of the canyon. The 2 daisy chains down the outside of the pack make for a great haul all option. Jacket, knee pads, chin bar, really whatever you can fit.</p>\n<p>Breathable mesh shoulder straps and back panel help you keep your cool, even when your legs are losing theirs. Whether you’re taking on the White Rim Trail or just committing to “one more ridge,” The Saguaro is here to carry your stuff and keep you going further and higher.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/SanUtilVestTrailShoot-13.webp?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/SanUtilVestTrailShoot-13.webp?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/SanUtilVestTrailShoot-13.webp?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/SanUtilVestTrailShoot-13.webp?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/SanUtilVestTrailShoot-49.webp?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/SanUtilVestTrailShoot-49.webp?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/SanUtilVestTrailShoot-49.webp?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/SanUtilVestTrailShoot-49.webp?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>$220</li>\n<li>Available in four colors at launch, full custom soon!</li>\n<li>No bounce design</li>\n<li>2 zipper front pockets</li>\n<li>Rear panel side zipper access</li>\n<li>Rear access key clip</li>\n<li>Stretch cord daisy chain</li>\n<li><strong>Capactiy</strong>: 5L including 2L Bladder Space</li>\n<li><strong>Weight</strong>: 1lb 2oz/ 510g</li>\n<li>Sewn in Winter Park, Colorado, USA</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Get your today at <a href=\"https://sanutildesign.com/products/the-saguaro-vest\" target=\"_blank\">San Util Design.</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cms.theradavist.com/san-util-desing-introduces-saguaro-hydration-vest-made-in-winter-park-colorado/\">San Util Desing Introduces Saguaro Hydration Vest Made in Winter Park, Colorado</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cms.theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"7421f3f2ed3263f8d82072f70c086aa4e6d9ae3d7a278772d5898e4e9f8c84b3","category":"Cycling"}
