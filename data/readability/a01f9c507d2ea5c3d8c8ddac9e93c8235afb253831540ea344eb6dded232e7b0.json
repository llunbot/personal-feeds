At 48 pounds, it’s portable enough to pack on camping trips or to live in the back of your trusty van or truck. There, it can provide power for outdoor staples like stoves, lanterns, and headlamps for days.</p><p>When working on projects outside the house or on a remote job site, the station can act as your power hub. It can run multiple tools at once and recharge with solar panels at the same time.</p><h3>Fast Charge Times</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164634/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-6.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164634/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-6.jpg\" alt=\"ecoflow delta max battery powered backup generator\" width=\"1400\" height=\"787\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164634/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-6.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164634/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-6-297x167.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164634/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-6-800x450.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164634/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-6-120x67.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164634/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-6-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p>Our friends at GearJunkie covered the<a href=\"https://gearjunkie.com/technology/ecoflow-delta-mini-portable-power-station?utm_source=PRAllGear&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=delta_max_launch\"><strong> DELTA mini</strong></a>, which touts fast charging times and the ability to power nearly all appliances. Those same qualities can be found in the DELTA Max.</p><p>In fact, the station reportedly charges up from zero to 80% in 65 minutes. The brand claims its full recharge time of 1.8 hours is twice as fast as similar power supplies on the market.</p><p>Additionally, the station can power multiple devices at the same time, which is important in emergency power scenarios, while working on projects, or just charging a few items at camp after a long day on the trail. Most appliances, phones, and outdoor gear can be powered by one of DELTA Max’s six AC outlets, two USB-C ports, or two USB-A ports.</p><p>Then there are appliances that draw substantial power. EcoFlow says the <a href=\"https://ecoflow.com/products/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-power-station?ctc=brsptechgeneralecoflowdeltamax\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DELTA Max</a> can power heavy-duty appliances like refrigerators or a dryer (up to 3,400 W). That’s something to consider if you’re in an area prone to blackouts.</p><p>Outside of emergency scenarios, the power station can be recharged using a standard AC outlet or a car charger.</p><h3>Boost its charging with solar panels</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164631/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164631/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-5.jpg\" alt=\"ecoflow delta max battery powered backup generator\" width=\"1400\" height=\"933\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164631/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-5.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164631/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-5-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164631/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-5-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164631/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-5-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164631/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-5-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p>In remote locations or during blackouts, the <a href=\"https://ecoflow.com/products/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-power-station?ctc=brsptechgeneralecoflowdeltamax\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DELTA Max</a> can use solar power to recharge. The brand reports adding two 400W EcoFlow solar panels can deliver 800W max solar charging speeds. The station has a voltage range from 11 to 100 V, and the MC4 connector lets you connect to other solar panels as well.</p><p>Currently, you can bundle a 110W or a 160W solar panel ($299 or $399, respectively) with the initial purchase of a DELTA Max station.</p><p>EcoFlow says its maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm will automatically optimize the solar input based on its readings of voltage and current in real time.</p><p>Also of note, you can monitor and control your power usage with the EcoFlow app if you’re connected to a Wi-Fi signal.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164624/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-0.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164624/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-0.jpg\" alt=\"ecoflow delta max battery powered backup generator\" width=\"1862\" height=\"788\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164624/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-0.jpg 1862w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164624/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-0-297x126.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164624/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-0-800x339.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164624/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-0-120x51.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164624/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-0-768x325.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12164624/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-generator-battery-backup-pack-0-1536x650.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1862px) 100vw, 1862px\"></a></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://ecoflow.com/products/ecoflow-delta-max-portable-power-station?ctc=brsptechgeneralecoflowdeltamax\"><strong>EcoFlow DELTA Max </strong></a>Specs</h3><ul><li><strong>Capacity: </strong>2,016 Wh</li><li><strong>Power output: </strong>2,400 W</li><li><strong>Charge time: </strong>100% in 1.8 hours (1,800W input)</li><li><strong>Fast charge time:</strong> 80% in 65 minutes</li><li><strong>Solar charge time: </strong>3.2-6.3 hours in full sunlight</li><li><strong>Solar inputs: </strong>800 W max, 11-100 V, 10 A</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 48 lbs.</li><li><strong>Price</strong>: $2,099</li></ul></div><h3>Add power capacity w/ extra batteries</h3><p>As is, the EcoFlow DELTA Max’s 2,016Wh capacity is enough to power several appliances and lights during a blackout.
