We reported on the Tap to Click bug earlier this month after receiving dozens of complaints from <em>MacRumors</em> readers who were seeing Tap to Click fail on a regular basis.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOn 2021 MacBook Pro models, there has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/05/m1-pro-max-youtube-hdr-crashes/\">an ongoing YouTube problem</a> that can result in HDR content from YouTube causing the machines to panic and crash, an issue that is addressed in ‌macOS Monterey‌ 12.1.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro users have also been dealing with an issue that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/30/16-inch-macbook-pro-charging-magsafe-3/\">could cause charging to stop</a> when the lid of the machine is closed, which Apple has fixed in the update.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere are several other notable bug fixes in ‌macOS Monterey‌ 12.1 as well. It addresses an issue that could cause the Desktop and Screen Saver to appear blank after selecting photos from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> library, and it fixes an issue that could cause external displays to not charge some MacBook Pro and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> computers when connected to Thunderbolt or USB-C. There's also a fix for an issue that could cause menu bar extras to be obscured by the camera housing on 2021 MacBook Pro models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌macOS Monterey‌ 12.1 is available to developers and public beta testers at this time and we're expecting to see an official release next week ahead of the Christmas holidays.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234\">macOS Monterey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/07/macos-monterey-12-1-bug-fixes/\">macOS Monterey 12.1 Fixes Major Tap to Click, YouTube HDR, and Charging Bugs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-monterey-12-1-fixes-major-tap-to-click-youtube-hdr-and-charging-bugs.2326587/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oh9CM9IbQpo:UUUb5UcaSCM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oh9CM9IbQpo:UUUb5UcaSCM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"41207a45613fa38d3b413cc2499f8a37dda49950eafd34fa18b29c859a092155","category":"Apple"}
