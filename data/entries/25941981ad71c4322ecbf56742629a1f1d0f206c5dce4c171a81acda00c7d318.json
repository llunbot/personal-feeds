John Fitzgerald has been building elegant custom steel bicycles under the name <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fitzcyclez1/\" target=\"_blank\">Fitz Cyclez</a> for just under two decades, yet he tends to fly under the radar. He doesn’t attend the big bike shows, and he’s not really interested in marketing his brand. But as anyone who’s seen a Fitz in the wild can attest, his work speaks for itself – and his work is seen often throughout Sonoma County and the greater Bay Area, thanks to Fitz’s popularity within the randonneuring community.</em></p>\n<p><i>To tell the tale of Fitz Cyclez from the eyes of a local, John Watson tapped Santa Rosa’s own <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nicholasmha/\" target=\"_blank\">Nicholas Haig-Arack</a> to interview John Fitzgerald.

It’s not the grapes; it’s the environment in which the grapes are grown. Custom bikes have <i>terroir</i>. Just like wine, the bikes made here are expressions of the climatic, topographic, and geologic diversity of the coastal mountains and rolling oak woodlands in which we ride.</p>\n<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-20.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-20.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-20.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-20.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-20.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-18.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-18.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-18.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-18.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-18.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-21.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-21.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-21.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-21.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-21.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Fitz showcasing a Tom Ritchey-inspired fork crown he uses on some builds</em></p>\n<p>One of the joys of custom framebuilding is that it’s a collaborative process resulting in a machine that’s purpose-built for the environments in which it operates.

He said, “Part of my service was to do a community service project. So we contacted Yellow Bike Project in Austin and said, ‘Hey, we want to do a project for kids, and we want you guys to be a part of it.’ I was the bike mechanic for this project. I was just kind of jazzed on going further, taking it to the next step. I wanted to figure out how I can make it happen with the framebuilding stuff. So I moved to Santa Cruz and took a welding class.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/04/Inside-Rock-Lobster-Cycles-16.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/04/Inside-Rock-Lobster-Cycles-16.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/04/Inside-Rock-Lobster-Cycles-16.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/04/Inside-Rock-Lobster-Cycles-16.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/04/Inside-Rock-Lobster-Cycles-16.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/04/Inside-Rock-Lobster-Cycles-31.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/04/Inside-Rock-Lobster-Cycles-31.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/04/Inside-Rock-Lobster-Cycles-31.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/04/Inside-Rock-Lobster-Cycles-31.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/04/Inside-Rock-Lobster-Cycles-31.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/04/Inside-Rock-Lobster-Cycles-31.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/04/Inside-Rock-Lobster-Cycles-31.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/04/Inside-Rock-Lobster-Cycles-31.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/04/Inside-Rock-Lobster-Cycles-32.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/04/Inside-Rock-Lobster-Cycles-32.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/04/Inside-Rock-Lobster-Cycles-32.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/04/Inside-Rock-Lobster-Cycles-32.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/04/Inside-Rock-Lobster-Cycles-32.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/rock-lobster-shop-visit/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Sadoff in his shop in Santa Cruz</a>, California, 2022</em></p>\n<p>“I contacted Paul Sadoff to put an order in with <a href=\"https://rocklobstercycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rock Lobster</a>, but I said, ‘You know, I’m really interested in what you’re doing.

This detail piqued my interest – the Pelican is a cult-classic randonneuring bike originally designed by Gabe Ehlert at the beloved <a href=\"https://www.boxdogbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Box Dog Bikes</a> in San Francisco’s Mission District. This bike was a gateway drug from the hyphy world of fixed gear riding in mid-2000s San Francisco to a more elegant and classical mode of cycling.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Weigle_Randonneur.jpeg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Weigle_Randonneur.jpeg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Weigle_Randonneur.jpeg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Weigle_Randonneur.jpeg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Weigle_Randonneur.jpeg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Peter Weigle from our <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2018-nahbs-j-p-weigle-concours-de-machines-randonneur/\" target=\"_blank\">2018 NAHBS Reportage</a></em></p>\n<p>The Pelican opened my eyes to all the possibilities of a life on two wheels. I was excited to learn that Fitz had built many of the first-gen Pelicans, but it came as no surprise – after all, Fitz Cyclez is known for rando bikes more than anything. He’s established a reputation for building lugged or semi-lugged frames in the classic French style, which in my opinion seems to be more prevalent among the East Coast builders due to the influence of J.P Weigle. There aren’t many <i>constructeurs</i> on the West Coast, even though the randonneuring scene on the West Coast is massive.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-12.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-12.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-12.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-12.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>After Wisconsin, Fitz moved to San Francisco. During this time, he built a number of frames from a shop in SF. He said, “I met up with the whole <a href=\"https://sfrandonneurs.org\">San Francisco Randonneurs</a> crowd. I knew the Pelican was popular here, because [Banjo] could never make them fast enough.” Eventually, rental prices drove him and Sandra further north to Santa Rosa, where they were able to buy a nice house with a garage that would become the present-day headquarters for Fitz Cyclez.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1334\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-14.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-14.jpg?w=1334&amp;quality=75 1334w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-14.jpg?resize=1200,1799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-14.jpg?resize=768,1151&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-14.jpg?resize=1025,1536&amp;quality=75 1025w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-11.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-11.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-11.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-11.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>On a quiet side street in Santa Rosa, Fitz’s small but tidy shop is set up with a vertical mill that he acquired from Ross Schafer, of Salsa-fame, a small horizontal mill that he uses for cutting chainstays, a bigger horizontal mill for cutting all the main tubes, a small lathe, a sandblasting cabinet, and a bunch of files. It’s not cramped or crowded, but it is precisely enough room for one person to build one bike at a time.

A steady diet of dirt has had a major influence on his design. Five years ago, Fitz Cyclez started producing a mountain cruiser. This fully rigid bike is purpose built for the trails in Annadel. It’s not quite underbiking, it’s <i>just enough</i> biking.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-101.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-101.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-101.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-101.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-101.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-100.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-100.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-100.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-100.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-100.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-99.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-99.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-99.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-99.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-99.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>It’s a joy to watch John Fitzgerald dance over the baby heads on North Burma aboard this neo-retro creation. He said, “I think there is definitely some value in the experience of being able to ride with the person who made the bike and understanding how their riding style influences the design decisions that they’re making. Like, are you going to trust my opinion about how a bike should perform when I can’t even ride up a hill? Where you ride helps inform how you build.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-103.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-103.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-103.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-103.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Fitz-Cyclez-Shop-Visit-103.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>So what’s next for Fitz Cyclez? He has a few projects in the works, including another mountain bike that envisions an alternative timeline for off-road riding. If his mountain cruiser was an updated version of the Cook/Koski SoCal lineage, then the new MTB will be a parallel-universe modern take on a Ross Schafer NorCal mountain bike. I can’t wait to see that! In the meantime, you can probably find him out on the trails or backroads of Sonoma County, sampling the <i>terroir</i>…</p>\n<p><em>Let’s check out some of the bikes that John photographed while visiting Fitz.
