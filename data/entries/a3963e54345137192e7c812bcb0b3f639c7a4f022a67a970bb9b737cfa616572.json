The company is expected to secure approximately 70% of Apple's UTG orders, with US-based Corning likely to provide the raw materials.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLens Technology has reportedly demonstrated significant advantages in mass production capabilities and financial resources for UTG manufacturing. The company is said to be particularly good at glass strengthening and minimizing side cracks after cutting, and also possesses glass etching technology.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe supplier plans to expand its UTG production line in 2025, ahead of Apple's anticipated launch of its first foldable device in the second half of 2026, according to the report. Apple's design approach apparently focuses on thinning only the central part of the UTG, which allows for greater overall thickness and improved durability.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSouth Korean firms Dowoo Insys and UTI are said to be potential secondary suppliers. Notably, Dowoo Insys secured two patents in October 2024 specifically related to the thinning of UTG's central part, with one patent showing similarities to Apple's own patent from the same period.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSamsung Display could be the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-foldable-panels-samsung-display/\">exclusive supplier</a> of foldable panels for Apple's first foldable device, which could be a foldable iPhone. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Jeff Pu, <em>The Information</em>, and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> have all targeted late 2026 or early 2027 for a potential launch.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-elec/\">The Elec</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/12/apple-taps-ultra-thin-glass-suppliersfoldable/\">Apple Taps Ultra-Thin Glass Suppliers for First Foldable Device</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-taps-ultra-thin-glass-suppliers-for-first-foldable-device.2449239/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a3963e54345137192e7c812bcb0b3f639c7a4f022a67a970bb9b737cfa616572","category":"Apple"}
