You have to scroll farther than ever to get to the links in Google search results, and now this trend is being taken to its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/zero-click-searches-googles-ai-tools-are-the-culmination-of-its-hubris/\">ultimate conclusion</a>. At I/O, the company has announced a major expansion of AI Mode search, which heralds a new era for its signature product.
