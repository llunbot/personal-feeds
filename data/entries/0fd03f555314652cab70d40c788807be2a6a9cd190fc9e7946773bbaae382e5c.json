It’s usually called “<a href=\"https://faq.whatsapp.com/673193694148537\">disappearing messages</a>”,\nbut sometimes goes by other names.</p>\n\n<p>I’m almost embarrassed to explain what this feature does, since\nit’s like explaining how a steering wheel works. <em>Nevertheless</em>.\nWhen you start a chat, you can decide how long the messages should\nstick around for. If your answer is <em>forever</em>, you don’t need to\ndo anything. However, if it’s a sensitive conversation and you\nwant it to be ephemeral in the same way that a phone call is, you\ncan pick a time, typically ranging from 5 minutes to 90 days. When\nthat time expires, your messages just get erased — on both your\nphone and the phones of the people you’re talking to.</p>\n\n<p>A separate feature of disappearing messages is that some platforms\nwill omit these conversations from device backups, or at least\nthey’ll make sure expired messages can’t be restored. This makes\nsense because <em>those conversations are supposed to be ephemeral</em>:\npeople are clearly not expecting those text messages to be around\nin the future, so they’re not as angry if they lose them a few\ndays early. [...]</p>\n\n<p>To recap, nearly <em>every single other messaging product</em> that\npeople use in large numbers (at least here in the US) has some\nkind of disappearing messages feature. Apple’s omission is\nstarting to be very unique.</p>\n\n<p>I do have some friends who work for Apple Security and I’ve tried\nto talk to them about this. [...] When I ask about disappearing\nmessages, I get embarrassed sighs and crickets. Nobody can explain\nwhy Apple is so far behind on this basic feature even <em>as an\noption</em>, long after it became standard in every other messenger.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can only speculate why iMessage doesn’t offer this feature. Perhaps Apple doesn’t want to imply that “disappearing messages” are in any way <em>guaranteed</em> to be ephemeral, which would be impossible. Who’s to say the recipient hasn’t screenshotted them? And if Messages were to impose a software block against capturing a screenshot of a “disappearing message” (like the way <a href=\"https://www.screenslate.com/articles/elegy-screenshot\">you can’t capture screenshots of DRM-protected video</a>), who’s to say the recipient hasn’t used another device to take a photograph of the display showing the ostensibly-ephemeral message? E2EE is a mathematical guarantee. There’s no way to offer such a guarantee regarding ephemerality, and perhaps that gives Apple pause.</p>\n\n<p>But I think that would be letting a desire for perfection get in the way of offering a feature that’s useful and good enough. People who use disappearing messages on other platforms — and as Green points out, all of iMessage’s rivals offer the feature — understand the risks. Vanishingly few people understand the difference between “encrypted in transit” and “end-to-end encrypted”. But just about everyone intuitively understands that even a “disappearing message” might be screenshotted, photographed, or otherwise recorded. There’s an implicit trust between sender and recipient.</p>\n\n<p>The other angle I can think of is complexity. Messages is one of Apple’s most-used apps, and in many ways it exemplifies Apple’s approach to software design and computing in general. Where critics see an app that is popular <em>despite</em> offering fewer features than its rivals, Apple (and I) see an app that is popular and beloved to some degree <em>because</em> it offers fewer features. All new features necessarily add some complexity, and disappearing messages would add quite a bit. Can you have two chats with the same person/group, one standard and one ephemeral? If so, now you’ve raised the specter of accidentally sending what’s intended to be a disappearing message to the non-ephemeral chat with that person or group. If not, how do you send a brief disappearing-message exchange with someone with whom you have a long archive of messages you want to keep forever? (Perhaps the idea of <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/105030\">private browsing in Safari</a> could serve as an inspiration for disappearing messages in Messages — an entirely separate mode with a distinct visual state.)</p>\n\n<p>The basic idea of disappearing messages is pretty trivial and easily understood. A good design for implementing them in Messages is not trivial. Solving these hard design problems is what makes Apple <em>Apple</em>, though. They’ve added some rather superficial features to Messages (<a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/create-genmoji-with-apple-intelligence-iph4e76f5667/ios\">Genmoji</a> and <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/104970\">message effects</a> for example), so I agree with Green that they <em>ought</em> to tackle disappearing messages and that surely they can find a way to do it where the added complexity doesn’t create confusion. It’s a hard challenge, to be sure, but a worthy one. Apple’s designers could really have some fun with this too, with novel ways to present “disappearingness” visually.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/01/green-imessage-disappearing-messages\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0fd03f555314652cab70d40c788807be2a6a9cd190fc9e7946773bbaae382e5c","category":"Tech"}
