{"title":"Barbara Broccoli on Amazon, in Private: ‘These People Are Fucking Idiots’","link":"https://www.wsj.com/business/media/james-bond-movies-amazon-barbara-broccoli-0b04f0db?st=P86jBM&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink","date":1740080552000,"content":"\n<p>Erich Schwartzel and Jessica Toonkel, reporting for The Wall Street Journal back on December 19, under the headline “Where Is James Bond? Trapped in an Ugly Stalemate With Amazon” (<a href=\"https://apple.news/A4AvCvPCIScSH_SJzKGD7gQ\">News+ link</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nearly three years after Amazon acquired the right to release Bond\nmovies through its $6.5 billion purchase of the\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studio, the relationship between the family\nthat oversees the franchise and the e-commerce giant has all but\ncollapsed. The decaying partnership has scuttled any near-term\nhope of a new Bond film — a black eye for Amazon’s ambitions in\nHollywood, since at the time of the MGM sale, the Bond franchise\nrepresented a significant share of the $6.5 billion the company\npaid for the studio.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to Bond’s future, the power lies in the hands of\nBarbara Broccoli, who inherited the control from her father,\nAlbert “Cubby” Broccoli, and who for 30 years has decided when a\nnew Bond movie can go into production. She has told friends she\ndoesn’t trust algorithm-centric Amazon with a character she helped\nto mythologize through big-screen storytelling and gut instinct.\nThis fall, she characterized the status of a new movie in dire\nterms — no script, no story and no new Bond.</p>\n\n<p>To friends, Broccoli has characterized her thoughts on Amazon this\nway: “These people are fucking idiots.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One way out of a stalemate, apparently, is to sell. Here’s Broccoli’s public statement today, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/james-bond-amazon-mgm-gain-creative-control-1236313930/\">accompanying the news</a> that Eon Productions has reached a deal <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/20/the-name-is-prime-james-bond-prime\">that shifts creative control over the franchise to Amazon</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the\nextraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our\nfather, producer Cubby Broccoli. I have had the honor of working\nclosely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have\nplayed 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry.\nWith the conclusion of ‘No Time to Die’ and Michael retiring from\nthe films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Broccoli’s brother Michael Wilson was ever so slightly more magnanimous in his statement, saying “Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future,” but it’s rather striking that Broccoli said not a word about Amazon in her statement, and Wilson’s praise only went so far as the lone adjective <em>trusted</em>. But the lie to Wilson’s attempt at even slight magnanimity is that Eon Productions and Amazon were <em>never</em> partners. It was the old MGM Studios, before Amazon’s acquisition, that was Eon’s partner from the very beginning (<a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/646-dr-no\">1963’s <em>Dr. No</em></a>).</p>\n\n<p>I meant to post a link to this WSJ story when it broke, and mistakenly thought I had, but it slipped through the cracks around the holidays. But I’ve had a bad feeling about the franchise’s future ever since.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/20/broccoli-amazon-idiots\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ef83d20314897f0388857c43978a0a0873a7b14caa4ef407986a2c6ec9463e7f","category":"Tech"}
