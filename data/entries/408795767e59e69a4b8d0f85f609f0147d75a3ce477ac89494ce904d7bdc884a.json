Like it or loathe it, pro cycling style in the 80s and 90s was an anything-goes wonderland of garish graphics, vibrant colors, and unlikely sponsorships. So, as part of their <em>Rapha20: Past Forward</em> celebrations, Rapha have partnered, once again, with skateboarding pioneers Palace for a limited edition collection that honors some of the era’s most memorable looks. Various heritage Rapha silhouettes have been injected with Palace’s signature irreverence, with playful inversions of cycling’s distinctive language, colors, and sponsors. The collection reimagines classic cycling style with post-modern panache.</p>\n<p>Preview it at <a href=\"https://content.rapha.cc/us/en/story/rapha-palace\" target=\"_blank\">Rapha</a>.</p>\n<p><em>The collection will be available from Tuesday, 8 October, at </em><a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>rapha.cc</em></a><em> for Rapha Cycling Club members and from Wednesday, 9 October, to general release via ballot on rapha.cc.</em><em> Customers must sign up for the ballot by 23.59 BST on Tuesday, 8 October, to be in with a chance of receiving an access email on Wednesday, 9 October. Limited quantities of the collection will also be available at the Rapha London Clubhouse, available on a first-come, first served basis from 8 am on Wednesday, 9 October.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/rapha-and-palace-have-teamed-up-again/\">Rapha and Palace Have Teamed Up Again</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"408795767e59e69a4b8d0f85f609f0147d75a3ce477ac89494ce904d7bdc884a","category":"Cycling"}
