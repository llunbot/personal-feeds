The seven new Vault partner integrations highlighted here extend the HashiCorp ecosystem into even more security use cases.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1718314845-screenshot-2024-06-13-at-5-15-43-pm.png\" alt=\"Vault\" /><h2><strong>HCP Vault Secrets integrations</strong></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/vault-secrets\">HCP Vault Secrets</a> is HashiCorp’s secrets management service focused on centralization and synchronization with multiple secret stores. The newest HCP Vault Secrets  integration is with Coder: </p>\n\n<h3><strong>Coder</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Coder, a self-hosted remote-development platform that helps shift software development from local machines to the cloud, launched a new <a href=\"https://registry.coder.com/modules/hcp-vault-secrets\">HCP Vault Secrets integration</a>. This integration allows developers to use HCP Vault Secrets within Coder to retrieve secrets  for pipelines and workflows.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Vault Enterprise integrations</strong></h2>\n\n<p>We’re pleased to announce four new Vault Enterprise integrations: </p>\n\n<h3><strong>Cohesity</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Cohesity provides AI-powered data security, replication, and management. It has released a new <a href=\"https://www.cohesity.com/blogs/cohesity-data-cloud-7-1-release-details/\">Vault Enterprise Cohesity KMIP integration</a> that allows Cohesity and Vault customers to offload cryptographic operations from the Cohesity platform to Vault and store critical KEK and DEK cryptographic keys inside Vault Enterprise.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Collibra</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Collibra’s  Data Intelligence Platform allows flexible governance, continuous quality, and built-in privacy. The company has completed a new <a href=\"https://productresources.collibra.com/docs/collibra/latest/Content/Edge/EdgeSecurity/co_vaults.htm\">Vault Enterprise integration</a> with its on-premises Edge solution that allows Edge to keep vital secrets outside of its platform while capitalizing on Vault’s security features. Secrets are fetched from Vault and used only during job execution. The secrets are then removed from the Edge site once the integration has completed execution. With this integration, customers can implement credential rotation and management seamlessly with Edge.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Qualys</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Qualys, which specializes in cloud security and compliance through its vulnerability-identification and scanning tools, recently completed a new <a href=\"https://docs.qualys.com/en/vm/latest/authentication/vaults/win_hashicorp_vault.htm\">Vault Enterprise integration</a>. Customers taking advantage of Qualys’ Vulnerability Management, Detection, and Response platform can now leverage Vault for secret storage and retrieval at time of scan for increased security throughout their environments.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Veritas</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Veritas, a secure multi-cloud data management and protection company, <a href=\"https://www.veritas.com/blogs/veritas-cyber-strategy-expanding-ecosystem\">announced a new Vault Enterprise integration</a> with its Veritas 360 Defense platform. This integration ties Vault KMIP with Veritas 360 Defense so users can centrally manage and protect their encryption keys to meet governance standards, rotate and distribute keys in a scheduled or on-demand fashion, and make data unreadable to unauthorized parties. Encryption of data at rest, on tape, on disk, or in the cloud helps prevent theft of data.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Vault Community Edition integrations</strong></h2>\n\n<p>We’re pleased to announce a pair of new HashiCorp Vault Community Edition integrations: </p>\n\n<h3><strong>Confluent</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Confluent, which provides a commercial platform for managing real-time data streams for event-driven architectures, launched a new plugin for Vault Community. The<a href=\"https://confluentinc.github.io/confluent-cloud-secrets-engine/\"> Confluent Cloud plugin for HashiCorp Vault</a> allows applications to automatically generate and store Confluent Cloud (CC) keys and secrets inside Vault.  Applications connecting to Confluent Cloud no longer need to be configured with CC keys and secrets and instead need access only to Vault. Additionally, Vault seamlessly manages rotation and revocation of CC secrets, easing the operational burden on security and developer teams.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Postman</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Postman, an API platform that streamlines collaboration and helps teams develop, document, test, and demo high-quality APIs at scale, released a new <a href=\"https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/hashicorp-vault/\">Vault Community integration</a>. This integration allows Postman API development workflows to securely access secrets stored in Vault.</p>\n\n<h2>Join the Vault Integration Program</h2>\n\n<p>To learn more about the Vault Integration Program and apply to become a validated partner, please visit our <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/partners/become-a-partner#technology\">Become a Partner page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you haven’t already, try the free tier of <a href=\"https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-up?product_intent=vault&amp;_gl=1*ut8xbv*_gcl_au*MTQ0ODQzODgxNC4xNzE3NTE4NzIz&amp;ajs_aid=df7d8476-37b6-4a6b-be4b-52ff4ae3789f\">HCP Vault</a> to help simplify your Vault workflows and management.</p>\n","author":"Tom O’Connell","siteTitle":"HashiCorp Blog","siteHash":"219aa6310b3388f2335eba49871f4df9581f2c58eaeb5e498363b54e835b7001","entryHash":"6ebf86948f2910c48d45b166f294d43bd07fe05cf0cdc97dbbdb44ca492ca473","category":"Tech"}
