Motherly figures vary too much for there to be any one ideal gift for the day we’ve set aside to thank mothers for their contributions.</p>\n<p>But we have some ideas, 33 to be specific, ranging from the coldly practical to the borderline ornamental. It’s up to you to decide between them. Be warned, while the motherly figures in your life might be someone who wants a robotic vacuum, your mother may be the type of person who's not into that.</p>\n<p>Knowing who your mother is—and not just clicking the buy button—is your most important contribution. We’ve provided some ideas below, all approved by mothers in our lives and ready for delivery by Sunday, May 14. Good luck!</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930308#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930308&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Chuong Nguyen","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"875b1684ac35203f45bdc5d52e5a4cd9a7f571e5a992c1a7505074c94799f823","category":"Tech"}
