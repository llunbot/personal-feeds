With NASA and other federal space agencies planning more manned missions and commercial companies bringing people to space, opportunities for human space travel are rapidly expanding.</p>\n<p>However, traveling to space poses risks to the human body. Since NASA wants to send a manned <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/topics/moon-to-mars\">mission to Mars</a> in the 2030s, scientists need to find solutions for these hazards sooner rather than later.</p>\n<p>As a kinesiologist who works with astronauts, I’ve spent years <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KaVh79oAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">studying the effects</a> space can have on the body and brain.
