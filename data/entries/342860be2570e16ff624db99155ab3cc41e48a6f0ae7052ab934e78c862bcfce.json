This requires precise and advanced manufacturing techniques, given the complexity of tighter circuit placement and the need for bending some wiring downwards beneath the bezel.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDisplay Driver ICs (DDIs), the components at the center of this manufacturing challenge, control the activation and illumination of pixels on the OLED panel. To meet Apple's requirements, LG Display is apparently diversifying its DDI supply chain, bringing on board Novatech from Taiwan alongside its existing supplier, LX Semicon. This move is designed to increase quality control while reducing costs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is not clear whether the slimmer bezel technology is destined for the standard ‌iPhone 16‌ models, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max, or both. It may be more likely to appear singularly in the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ models since these devices are expected to see display size increases from 6.1- to 6.3-inches and 6.7- to 6.9-inches, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/iphone-16-design-showcased-by-dummy-models/\">without a substantial increase</a> in overall size. It is also worth noting that Apple reduced the bezels of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max last year significantly more than the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus. Last month, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/iphone-16-ultra-thin-bezels-rumor/\">report coming out of Korea</a> suggested that BIS technology will come to the entire ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theelec-kr/\">The Elec KR</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/iphone-16-even-thinner-bezels/\">iPhone 16 Rumored to Feature Even Thinner Bezels</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-rumored-to-feature-even-thinner-bezels.2423511/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"342860be2570e16ff624db99155ab3cc41e48a6f0ae7052ab934e78c862bcfce","category":"Apple"}
