An extensive new report from <em>The Information</em> this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/chaos-behind-siri-revealed/\">reveals details of the turmoil that has gone on behind the scenes at Apple</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iOS-18-Siri-Personal-Context.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nAccording to the report, indecision and repeated changes in direction from Apple leadership about how to deploy Apple Intelligence frustrated engineers working on the project, with Siri in particular being a \"hot potato\" that bounced between teams without significant progress being made.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSources indicate that some of the most impressive Siri features demoed in Apple's Intelligence's unveiling at WWDC 2024 were effectively fictitious, with the functionality not even working on test devices at that point. The demo even apparently came as a surprise to members of the Siri team.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Waiting for the Perfect MacBook Pro? 2026 Might Be the Year</h2>\r<br />\nWe're expecting an update to the MacBook Pro later this year with a new M5 chip and some other upgrades, but for a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/2026-perfect-macbook-pro-rumors/\">much more substantial revamp, you might want to wait until 2026</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/M6-MacBook-Pro-Feature-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1265\" />\r<br />\nRumors indicate the 2026 MacBook Pro could see a design overhaul with OLED displays, a smaller pinhole camera cutout replacing the current notch, and perhaps even a thinner and lighter design and 5G connectivity.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to the MacBook Pro overhaul, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/apple-larger-foldable-mass-production-2026/\">2026 may also see the launch of Apple's rumored large foldable device</a>, which reportedly features an 18.8-inch display when unfolded.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iOS 18.4.1 Update Coming Soon for iPhones</h2>\r<br />\niOS 18.5 remains in early beta testing, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/09/ios-18-4-1-coming-soon/\">Apple appears to have an interim iOS 18.4.1 update on the way</a>, and it should be arriving within the next week or two.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iOS-18.4.1-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIt's unclear what fixes will be included in the update, but these updates typically focus on security issues. It's possible it could also address a few problems that popped up in the iOS 18.4 update such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/04/ios-18-4-carplay-bugs-multiple-vehicle-brands/\">CarPlay connectivity issues some users have been experiencing</a>, though that's merely speculation at this point.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/apr-10-2025\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/12/top-stories-ios-19-iphone-17-pro-rumors/\">Top Stories: iOS 19 and iPhone 17 Pro Rumors, Siri Revamp Turmoil, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-ios-19-and-iphone-17-pro-rumors-siri-revamp-turmoil-and-more.2455192/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"28aac6b332a665780775485021e048ebe34dea15c5325e4ee47f79c17b609c3c","category":"Apple"}
