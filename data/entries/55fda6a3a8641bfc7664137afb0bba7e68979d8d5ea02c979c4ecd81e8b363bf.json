The admission comes despite a WotC policy barring the use of AI in its art, and the controversy has already caused at least one MtG artist to publicly announce that he is \"done\" with the company.</p>\n<p>The promo image in question was posted in a now-deleted (but <a href=\"https://archive.is/BA6Qq\">still archived</a>) social media post last Thursday, showing five new \"retro frame\" versions of lands from the upcoming Ravnica Remastered set in a nondescript steampunk-style laboratory. While the image looks unobjectionable at first glance, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GreenSkyDragon/status/1743072023268802730\">careful viewers</a> soon <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RigoTheRiot/status/1743998240192937989\">zoomed in</a> on specific and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jonappgar/status/1743435044650397753\">incongruous background details</a> in the lab that showed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/ai-generated-art-hands-fingers-messed-up\">telltale errors</a> common to some AI image generators.

Last August, when a longtime D&amp;D artist was found to be using AI tools for commissioned pieces, WotC <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DnDBeyond/status/1687969469170094083\">said</a> that it was \"updating our artist guidelines to make clear that artists must refrain from using AI art generation as part of their art creation process for developing D&amp;D art.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994427#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994427&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"55fda6a3a8641bfc7664137afb0bba7e68979d8d5ea02c979c4ecd81e8b363bf","category":"Tech"}
