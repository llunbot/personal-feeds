The launch date is already official, set<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Moto/status/1658464893048356867\"> for June 1</a>. The new Razr line comprises all new-school flip phones that are about the size of a normal smartphone when open, but when you're done with them, the whole device, including the screen, can fold in half, giving you a smaller square to fit into your pocket.</p>\n<p>There are two models of the upcoming device, called either the \"Razr 40 Ultra\" or \"Razr+, and a cheaper model that might end up being called the Razr 40. Legendary leaker Evan Blass has been all over the release of this phone, sharing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1656741402246610946\">press images</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1659555002774351872\">other details</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/moto-razr-40-leaked-official-press-renders-design-colour-options-exclusive/\">MySmartPrice</a> has leaks of the cheaper model. We don't necessarily know every tiny difference between the two models, but the big difference will be the cover display.</p>\n<p>These foldable devices are closed a lot of the time, so an outer display is very useful for the 100-plus times a day you check your phone—it's nice to just quickly look at it without needing to open up the phone. The Ultra model is going for about as big of a front display as possible, including wrapping around the two primary cameras that live in the bottom-right corner of the front of the phone. Working around all that dead space is going to make for some interesting software design decisions. The cheaper model, meanwhile, has a much smaller display, similar to the first-generation Galaxy Flip. It's a tiny little thing to the left of the camera array and can only show smartwatch-style widgets. </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940893#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940893&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a3db26ec202a64233ed62860564d2318950f8e59b13e248e395ebb7c7d232fb6","category":"Tech"}
