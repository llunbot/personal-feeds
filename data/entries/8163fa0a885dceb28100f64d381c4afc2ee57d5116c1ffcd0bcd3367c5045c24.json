The company had faced days of backlash from the sex workers who helped OnlyFans become a success, only to see the site announce a change that would dramatically reduce their income.</p>\n<p>Less than a week ago, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/08/onlyfans-bans-sexually-explicit-content-to-appease-banks-and-payment-services/\">OnlyFans announced</a>Â that it would \"prohibit the posting of any content containing sexually explicit conduct\" starting October 1 but continue to allow nudity. OnlyFans said it was making the change \"to comply with the requests of our banking partners and payout providers,\" which have faced pressure from the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE), an <a href=\"https://endsexualexploitation.org/issues/pornography/\">anti-pornography group</a> that lobbied financial companies <a href=\"https://ncose.salsalabs.org/17032021corponlyfanscreditcards/index.html\">to stop processing payments for OnlyFans</a>. The UK-based OnlyFans was also pressured into action by a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-57255983\">BBC investigation</a> that found some children were able to bypass the online platform's age-verification system.</p>\n<p>Despite those developments, OnlyFans said on Wednesday that it will be able to continue processing payments from subscribers to creators who post sexually explicit photos and videos.
