While powerful tools like Photoshop or Final Cut Pro certainly have price tags commensurate with their robust feature sets, many of the greatest Mac apps won’t cost you anything more than the time they take to download them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick note before we begin. Apple has changed its security settings in macOS, so you’ll need to allow your system to open a couple of these apps. A dialogue box may pop up telling you a certain app “is an application downloaded from the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it?” Click Open to proceed with the installation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the best free Mac apps we use, in alphabetical order.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><div></div><div>\n<h2>Amphetamine – free anti-sleep app</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Amphetamine-Mac.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Amphetamine Mac\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><br /></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Amphetamine will keep your Mac awake.

A robust desktop client for recording and editing multi-track projects, Audacity will let you edit and add effects just like you would with Logic Pro X without needing to spend hundreds of dollars on a bunch of features you won’t need. Granted, the interface is quite a bit outdated, but you need only spend a few minutes with it to see just how powerful it is. A killer tool for podcasting, recording audio books, and creating video voiceovers, Audacity will turn your Mac into a multi-track recording studio, and it won’t cost you a dime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Download <a href=\"https://www.audacityteam.org/download/mac/\">Audacity</a>.</p>\n</div></div>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\n<div><div></div><div>\n<h2>Backup and Sync from Google</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/google-photos.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the most stalwart Mac fans have to admit that Google does photos better than Apple, despite Apple’s improvements over the years. While there ids no longer the unlimited free storage there once was, with instant syncing across virtually any device, and an amazing search engine, Google Photos is everything we wish Apple Photos would be. But you might not know that there’s a super easy way to get photos from your Mac into your Google Photos library. Google offers a small utility called <a href=\"https://photos.google.com/apps\">Backup and Sync</a> that will automatically upload images stored on your Mac. The simple menu bar app works with your Google Drive to continuously scan for images in folders of your choosing to keep your photo library in sync. And it’s so efficient, you won’t even know it’s working. But thats not all! Backup and Sync makes an extremely effective cloud storage solution for <em>all</em> file types. In fact, if you use more than just Apple gear, it’s probably the best cloud storage solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get <a href=\"https://photos.google.com/apps\">Backup and Sync</a>.</p>\n</div></div>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\n<div><div></div><div>\n<h2>BBEdit – free HTML and text editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bbedit-difference.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>BBEdit</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Professional software developers have been singing BBEdit’s praises for years, but you don’t need to spend a bundle to get on board. The free version of BBEdit is a full-featured editor in its own right, sporting powerful features such as multiple clipboards, automatic backups, live search and syntax-highlighting support for more than 20 programming languages.

Fast, smart, and endlessly customizable, Google’s browser is an excellent alternative to Apple’s, with speedy surfing, smart syncing, and Google Assistant-style voice searches.

Rather than let you choose from a complicated list of servers, ClearVPN’s straightforward interface will automatically route you to the best option based on what you want to do, whether it’s private browsing or watching Netflix outside the U.S. Everything else happens in the background—protocols, servers, and encryption are handled in real-time using MacPaw’s Dynamic Flow Technology that automatically selects the best server for your needs. Heavy users will want to subscribe for $13 a month, but the free plan—which offers few shortcuts including Netflix streaming and ad-free browsing—is a great addition to any Mac.

And some of them could be eating up precious space on your drive.

Simply drag a folder onto its window and within seconds you’ll have a full report of the duplicates on your machine, letting you see what they are and where they’re hiding, and letting you delete them in a snap. Unless you opt for the $5 pro version, you’ll have to deal with the occasional ad, but it’s an indispensable tool nonetheless.

Bringing everything you love about the web interface to your Dock, the Slack desktop app lets you quickly switch between groups, change your status, drag and drop files, and, of course, communicate with your team members. A lightning-fast search gives you instant access to buried messages, and granular notifications will keep you apprised of only the most important correspondences. It’s so good, you might not want to turn it off at the end of the work day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Download <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slack/id803453959?mt=12\">Slack</a>.</p>\n</div></div>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\n<div><div></div><div>\n<h2>Spark – free email app </h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/spark.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s default email client gets better with each macOS revision, but if you’re looking for something different, Spark will be a refreshing change of pace. Smart, stylish, and speedy, Spark will help you get control over your inbox with powerful filters that help you focus on the messages that need your attention. It works with Gmail, iCloud, Outlook, and just about any other email address, and its companion iOS apps will keep all of them perfectly synced. With a deceptively powerful interface and a slew of advanced features, Spark just might ignite your passion for email again. Or at least make you not hate it as much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Download Spark from the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spark-love-your-email-again/id1176895641?mt=12\">Mac App Store</a>.</p>\n</div></div>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\n<div><div></div><div>\n<h2>Spotify – free music streamer</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/spotify.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Music might come free with every new Mac, but unless you subscribe for $10 a month, it’s kinda useless for listening to anything other than your purchased music (although there are ways to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675739/how-to-get-apple-music-for-free-2.html\" target=\"_blank\">get Apple Music for free</a>). That’s not the case with the Spotify app. Whether you’re a premium subscriber or a free one, the Spotify app for the Mac is chock full of tunes to get you through your workday. It also makes an excellent podcast directory and player. Just like the iPhone app, you can listen to anything you want with two limitations: shuffle mode is always on and visual and audio ads occasionally pop up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Download <a href=\"https://www.spotify.com/us/download/mac/\"><strong>Spotify</strong></a>.</p>\n</div></div>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\n<div><div></div><div>\n<h2>VLC media player – free media player </h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vlc2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Video formats are constantly changing, and you no doubt have all sorts of movie files littering your Mac’s drive.

You will, however, need to have your phone within range and connected to Wi-Fi, and you won’t be able to make calls, but if you’re a chromic Whatsapper, it’s a must-have.
