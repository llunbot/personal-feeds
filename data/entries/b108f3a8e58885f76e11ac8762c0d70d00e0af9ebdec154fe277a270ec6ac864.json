Dubbed HYPR-X, the new compound is a hybrid of the road-specific HYPR compound, which delivers low rolling resistance, and the race-winning MaxxSpeed compound used in the Maxxis mountain bike tire range. HYPR-X will be incorporated into the full range of Maxxis’ new gravel tire models.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1708\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MaxisGravelTires-scaled.webp\" alt=\"The Reaver, Ramble, Ravager and Receptor gravel tires. \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MaxisGravelTires-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MaxisGravelTires-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MaxisGravelTires-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MaxisGravelTires-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MaxisGravelTires-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MaxisGravelTires-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MaxisGravelTires-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MaxisGravelTires-720x480.webp 720w\" /><figcaption>Maxxis has a HYPR-X tire for whatever your local gravel looks like. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout 2025, we will see new versions of the Receptor, Rambler, Ravager, and Reaver released with the new HYPR-X compound. Maxxis is touting a whopping 25% decrease in rolling resistance and an equally enticing 19% increase in cornering bite. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond performance boosts, these updated gravel tires will use a stronger nylon in the casing, which Maxxis promises will dramatically enhance casing durability. As has been the case, the sidewalls will be protected by Maxxis’ Exo Protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1956\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KeeganShredding-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Keegan Swenson breaks the rear tire loose on a gravel ride\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KeeganShredding-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KeeganShredding-297x227.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KeeganShredding-1536x1173.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KeeganShredding-120x92.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KeeganShredding-768x587.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KeeganShredding-2048x1565.webp 2048w\" /><figcaption>The HYPR-X compound might help you ride a bit more like this guy.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new line of Maxxis tires also look better than previous models, with updated graphics on the hot patches that are more in line with the minimal aesthetics of contemporary gravel bikes. Maxxis also remains committed to reducing plastic waste by shipping all its tires in recyclable paper packaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1489\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MaxxisPackaging-1-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Maxxis' gravel range in packaging\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MaxxisPackaging-1-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MaxxisPackaging-1-297x173.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MaxxisPackaging-1-1536x893.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MaxxisPackaging-1-120x70.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MaxxisPackaging-1-768x447.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MaxxisPackaging-1-2048x1191.webp 2048w\" /><figcaption>The graphics are new and improved, and the recyclable packaging continues.  </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Maxxis, the Reaver and the Rambler with HYPR-X and new casing will be available first in 700X45C, with other sizes debuting over the next three months. All sizes of the Ravager and the Receptor are scheduled to roll out in the third quarter of 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you may have noticed a bit of sea change in gravel tire sizing of late. If the bigger (and bigger and bigger) is better trend continues to gain momentum, and frame and rim manufacturers fully get on board, all the the sizes in the photo above might be obsolete in the not-so-distant future. So, we do expect that when Maxxis says “other sizes” of these gravel tires are debuting in 2025, they mean 50mm+, up to 2.2″, which used to just be an MTB Marathon race tire.
