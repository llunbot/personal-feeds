Tubular options are still available, too, but the big news is their move to a modern tubeless-ready design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both come in 32mm and 47mm deep rim profiles, all having a 21mm internal width that fits 25-32mm wide tires. And both get their latest ratchet rear hub, which uses 36-tooth ratchet rings for 10º engagement, approximately 17% faster than the prior hub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both wheels also use a 3K carbon laid over their rigid foam core, which acts as a structural element to improve compaction during molding and add lateral stiffness.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The MCC EVO is their top model, coming in at a bank-busting $4,200 (3690€ / 3590£) for the set, but Corima claims they have a 15% better stiffness to weight ratio than competitor’s wheels. They claim the improved torsional stiffness sends more of your power into forward motion, so you’re faster and waste less energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/corima-MCC-EVO-full-carbon-tubeless-road-bike-wheels.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"969\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/corima-MCC-EVO-full-carbon-tubeless-road-bike-wheels.jpg\" alt=\"Corima MCC EVO full carbon one piece road bike wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/corima-MCC-EVO-full-carbon-tubeless-road-bike-wheels.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/corima-MCC-EVO-full-carbon-tubeless-road-bike-wheels-297x144.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/corima-MCC-EVO-full-carbon-tubeless-road-bike-wheels-800x388.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/corima-MCC-EVO-full-carbon-tubeless-road-bike-wheels-120x58.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/corima-MCC-EVO-full-carbon-tubeless-road-bike-wheels-768x372.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/corima-MCC-EVO-full-carbon-tubeless-road-bike-wheels-1536x744.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They use full carbon spokes with a carbon hub shell and rim, all bonded and molded together to create a one-piece wheel.
