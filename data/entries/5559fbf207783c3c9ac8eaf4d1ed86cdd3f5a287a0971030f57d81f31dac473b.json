No gold, silver, or other precious metals resulted as he had hoped. But after the stone had cooled, Casciarolo discovered something interesting: if he exposed the material to sunlight and then took it into a dark room, the stone would glow.</p>\n<p>That \"Bologna Stone\" was the <a href=\"https://www.schweizerbart.de/papers/ejm/detail/24/78460/The_Bologna_Stone_history_s_first_persistent_lumin?af=crossref\">first artificially prepared, persistently luminescent substance</a>. Many more were to followâ€”and today, persistent luminescent materials are used for decorations, emergency lighting, pavement markings, and medical imaging.</p>\n<p>Someday they might give us glowing cities that stay cooler and use less electricity.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1815878#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1815878&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5559fbf207783c3c9ac8eaf4d1ed86cdd3f5a287a0971030f57d81f31dac473b","category":"Tech"}
