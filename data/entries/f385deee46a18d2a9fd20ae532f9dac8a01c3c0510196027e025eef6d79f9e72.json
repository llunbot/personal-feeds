Developing Mountain Biking Scotland (DMBinS), an organisation heavily involved in making the case for the Innovation Center says, <em>“The proposal is that the Innovation Centre will be accompanied by a Bike Park. Together these developments create an attractive package, which not only facilitates easy bike testing and development but attracts companies to live and work next to outstanding trails and support our rural communities to prosper in a sustainable way”.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tracy-moseley-e-ews-racing-tweedvalley-2022-technical-climbing.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tracy-moseley-e-ews-racing-tweedvalley-2022-technical-climbing-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"tracy moseley ews-e racing tweed valley 2021 technical climbing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tracy-moseley-e-ews-racing-tweedvalley-2022-technical-climbing-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tracy-moseley-e-ews-racing-tweedvalley-2022-technical-climbing-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tracy-moseley-e-ews-racing-tweedvalley-2022-technical-climbing-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tracy-moseley-e-ews-racing-tweedvalley-2022-technical-climbing-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tracy-moseley-e-ews-racing-tweedvalley-2022-technical-climbing-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tracy-moseley-e-ews-racing-tweedvalley-2022-technical-climbing-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tracy-moseley-e-ews-racing-tweedvalley-2022-technical-climbing.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Legend of the sport, Tracy Moseley, racing the E-EWS in the Tweed Valley</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tweed Valley is a highly attractive destination for mountain bikers around the world thanks to its vast quantity of accessible, volunteer-built and -maintained enduro trails. Its position in the minds of riders the world over was cemented after it hosted the Enduro World Series in 2021 and 2022. This year will see the Tweed Valley host the 2023 Cycling World Championships in August – more specifically, the XCO and Marathon Events. Rightly so, DMBinS, the Mountain Bike Centre of Scotland and the Scottish Government are looking to realize the potential of the region to sustain an industry for mountain biking with creation of a £19 Million Mountain Bike Innovation Centre.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/trailsontrial-manon-carpenter-neil-carnegie-riding-tweed-valley-scotland.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/trailsontrial-manon-carpenter-neil-carnegie-riding-tweed-valley-scotland-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"trails on trial manon carpenter dwaco film documentary wild trail building uk scotland neil carnegie tvta\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/trailsontrial-manon-carpenter-neil-carnegie-riding-tweed-valley-scotland-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/trailsontrial-manon-carpenter-neil-carnegie-riding-tweed-valley-scotland-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/trailsontrial-manon-carpenter-neil-carnegie-riding-tweed-valley-scotland-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/trailsontrial-manon-carpenter-neil-carnegie-riding-tweed-valley-scotland-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/trailsontrial-manon-carpenter-neil-carnegie-riding-tweed-valley-scotland-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/trailsontrial-manon-carpenter-neil-carnegie-riding-tweed-valley-scotland-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/trailsontrial-manon-carpenter-neil-carnegie-riding-tweed-valley-scotland.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>A local trail builder leads Manon Carpenter down a Tweed Valley Classic for her mega insightful <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/must-watch-trails-on-trial-a-story-on-the-legitimization-of-wild-mtb-trails-across-the-uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Trails on Trial Film</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Scottish Borders Mountain Bike Innovation Centre Build Underway</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4>Press Release from South of Scotland Enterprise and Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>South of Scotland Enterprise (SOSE) has confirmed that planning permission has been secured to renovate Caerlee Mill in Innerleithen to be the home of the new Mountain Bike Innovation Centre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together with the proposed Tweed Valley Bike Park and Trail Lab near Innerleithen, the Mountain Bike Innovation Centre is a key development for the South of Scotland and will be funded as part of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK Government is investing £19 million into the project.
