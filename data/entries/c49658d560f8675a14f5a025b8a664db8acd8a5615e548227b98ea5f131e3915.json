Analogue is releasing a glow-in-the-dark version of the Pocket, with all the same features as the original but a new green luminescent casing that recalls every cheap plastic glow-in-the-dark toy I ever had.</p>\n\n<p>This \"Pocket Glow\" costs $249.99, $30 more than the regular white and black Pocket consoles, and will be available in \"highly limited quantities.\" It <a href=\"https://store.analogue.co/\">will go on sale on September 1 at 8 am Pacific</a>, and when it's gone, it's gone. The console will ship on September 5, so at least glow-in-the-dark Pocket preorderers won't need to wait as long as the first few waves of people who ordered the console. Analogue says the Pocket Glow can glow for up to eight hours when the casing has been fully charged by a bulb, the Sun, or some other external source.</p>\n<p>The Pocket Glow is being released under an \"Analogue Editions\" umbrella, implying that other limited-edition console releases will follow at some point in the future. As the Pocket itself emulates Nintendo's handhelds, this emulates Nintendo's hardware release strategy, where special limited-edition consoles are released periodically to re-sell hardware to superfans who already have the standard editions (as the owner of a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075MZT541/?tag=arstech20-20\">Poké ball-themed Nintendo 2DS XL</a>, I will admit that I am not immune).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1963785#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1963785&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c49658d560f8675a14f5a025b8a664db8acd8a5615e548227b98ea5f131e3915","category":"Tech"}
