And that approach was built on a willingness to try new ideas and push the boundaries of what was possible - an approach that embodies the California spirit.</blockquote>California's nomination has been presented to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee (CCAC), which will take design recommendations to the Treasury Secretary for final approval. The CCAC decided to recommend a coin with Steve Jobs in his iconic turtleneck and glasses, but the design is not finalized and could be updated before the coin is made.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe coin is expected to be produced and made available in 2026.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/california/\">California</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/steve-jobs/\">Steve Jobs</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/california-steve-jobs-innovation-coin/\">California Nominates Steve Jobs for $1 American Innovation Coin</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/california-nominates-steve-jobs-for-1-american-innovation-coin.2449932/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"73b13600b96805e8312b4d43bf4a1782a08dae5969dd68f7b8b1ee0c9915d47d","category":"Apple"}
