In the end, Deignan finished the 157.7 km slog from Antwerp to Leuven in 14th, but is on the whole satisfied with how things played out.</p><p>“I was really happy with the way I rode,” Deignan told CyclingTips after the finish. “Tactically, I kept putting myself in good positions, and [I had] phenomenal teammates in Pfeiffer Georgi and Anna Henderson. I just missed the legs in the end and that’s the way it is, it’s a bike race.”</p><p>With Deignan their protected rider, the Brits were one of the teams to take responsibility for pace-setting early on, and once the attacks started, Pfeiffer Georgi and Anna Henderson were instrumental. But even with teammates to do the work, it was a constant effort to maintain position and keep in touch.</p><p>“It was like a criterium at the end of 160 km at the end of a tough season,” Deignan said. “Out of each corner there were motorbikes, so the top ten probably got a rush off the motorbike out of the corner. If you were further back than that, you were just chasing. I looked down and I was doing 60 km/h out of the corners. There was a lot of damage being caused, and it was hard to just surf the wheels. Even moving up positions was really difficult because the speed was so high.”</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1235487604-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>Lizzie Deignan (Great Britain) follows Marianne Vos (Netherlands) during the World Champs road race.</figcaption></figure><p>There was a flurry of repeated attacks towards the end of the event, and though the formidable Netherlands team were all over the action, Deignan is sure they had their minds set on a sprint. And yet, perhaps it was a mistake to allow so many Italians to ride with them to the line.</p><p>“As soon as the Dutch rode so defensively on Overijse [97 km into the race], I thought, ‘yeah, it’s going to come to a sprint’,” Deignan explained. “I expected them to use their strength a bit better over the climbs. I was surprised to see them not doing that because if you give the Italians a sniff of a sprint in a World Championships, they’re going to take it because they execute it so well.”</p><p>And execute it they did. Elisa Longo Borghini led out her 23-year-old teammate – a future teammate of Deignan’s too, Elisa Balsamo having signed with Trek-Segafredo for 2022 – who held off the Netherlands’s three-time world champion Marianne Vos. Deignan came home in the bunch a second later.</p></div></div>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"2bbc20cb87cd0e863aead0ea96ef61b32fc1b766805b66611592f18c09a4c35c","category":"Cycling"}
