Built up the Industry Nine’s Hydra Hubset, the new EN300 Wheelsets are around 20g heavier than the outgoing EN305 equivalent, but in-house impact testing demonstrates the rim’s superior strength.

It has an internal width of 30mm, a dimension that most of the industry appears to have settled on for tires in the 2.3″ to 2.6″ range. Meanwhile, the external width grows to 37.6mm in a bid to both reduce bead shelf and bead wall deformation during impacts, and to reduce the risk of pinch flats.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/industrynine-en300-rim-profile-30mm-int-width.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"580\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/industrynine-en300-rim-profile-30mm-int-width-800x580.jpg\" alt=\"industrynine en300 alloy rim profile internal external width\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/industrynine-en300-rim-profile-30mm-int-width-800x580.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/industrynine-en300-rim-profile-30mm-int-width-297x215.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/industrynine-en300-rim-profile-30mm-int-width-120x87.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/industrynine-en300-rim-profile-30mm-int-width-768x557.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/industrynine-en300-rim-profile-30mm-int-width-1536x1114.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/industrynine-en300-rim-profile-30mm-int-width.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>The bead wall slopes downwards towards its outer edge to further reduce the risk of pinch flats</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The real new-ness here cannot be seen with the naked eye. While the EN305 featured a solid bead wall, the new EN300 aluminum rim gets a hollow bead wall extrusion, said to help the rim shrug off impacts while maintaining a competitive system weight. The rim depth remains relatively shallow at 18.5mm, with an asymmetric bed profile that allows for more balanced spoke tensions between the DS and NDS. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Industry-Nine-Enduro-300-hydra-wheelset.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Industry-Nine-Enduro-300-hydra-wheelset-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"industrynine en300 alloy wheelset orange spokes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Industry-Nine-Enduro-300-hydra-wheelset-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Industry-Nine-Enduro-300-hydra-wheelset-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Industry-Nine-Enduro-300-hydra-wheelset-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Industry-Nine-Enduro-300-hydra-wheelset-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Industry-Nine-Enduro-300-hydra-wheelset-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Industry-Nine-Enduro-300-hydra-wheelset-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Industry-Nine-Enduro-300-hydra-wheelset.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Industry Nine’s in-house impact testing quantified just how much stronger the EN300 is as compared to the EN305. Numbers in the table below pertain to the percentage improvement in deformation of the EN300 over the EN305.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“We set a number of test wheels up in a vertical impact testing fixture and impacted with a sliding anvil and measured the rim damage from increasingly rising heights. We used a smooth 29” tire for tread uniformity that a regular MTB tire might not provide. After the test was conducted, we measured the deformation in a few different rim locations – the movement that the bead wall defected towards the rim center, and the deformation we measured on the bead shelf, where the base of the tire bead would sit against the rim. The results we shared are our results from testing the EN305v3 against the EN300. We saw improvement on both “minor impact events” and “severe impact events” in the bead wall and bead shelf deformations on the EN300 over the EN305″</em> – David Thomas, Industry Nine.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Moderate Impact</td><td>Severe Impact</td></tr><tr><td>Bead Shelf Deformation</td><td>41%</td><td>28%</td></tr><tr><td>Bead Wall Deformation</td><td>22%</td><td>35%</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Data from Industry Nine’s in-house test procedures</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The EN300 will be sold as a complete wheelset only, laced up with 32 spokes to the 6-Bolt Hydra Hubset. Claimed weight for the complete wheelset with XD freehub is 1,870g for the 29″, and 1,800g for the 27.5″. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/industrynine-en300-enduro-wheelset-turquoise-spoke-hydra-hubs.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/industrynine-en300-enduro-wheelset-turquoise-spoke-hydra-hubs-800x300.jpg\" alt=\"industrynine en300 enduro wheelsets custom color spokes hubs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/industrynine-en300-enduro-wheelset-turquoise-spoke-hydra-hubs-800x300.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/industrynine-en300-enduro-wheelset-turquoise-spoke-hydra-hubs-297x111.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/industrynine-en300-enduro-wheelset-turquoise-spoke-hydra-hubs-120x45.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/industrynine-en300-enduro-wheelset-turquoise-spoke-hydra-hubs-768x288.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/industrynine-en300-enduro-wheelset-turquoise-spoke-hydra-hubs-1536x576.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/industrynine-en300-enduro-wheelset-turquoise-spoke-hydra-hubs.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pricing &amp; Availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Pricing for the Industry Nine EN300 Wheelset starts at $1430 USD, with black spokes and hubs, and the choice of HG, XD or MicroSpline Freehubs.
