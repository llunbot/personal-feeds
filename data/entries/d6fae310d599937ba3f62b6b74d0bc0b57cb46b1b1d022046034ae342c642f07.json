They deliver the highest performance and fastest memory bandwidth among comparable Intel processors in the cloud.</p> \n<p>Today we’re announcing new Amazon EC2 C8id, M8id, and R8id instances backed by up to 22.8TB of NVMe-based SSD block-level instance storage physically connected to the host server. These instances offer 3 times more vCPUs, memory and local storage compared to previous sixth-generation instances.</p> \n<p>These instances deliver up to 43% higher compute performance and 3.3 times more memory bandwidth compared to previous sixth-generation instances. They also deliver up to 46% higher performance for I/O intensive database workloads, and up to 30% faster query results for I/O intensive real-time data analytics compared to previous sixth generation instances.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>C8id instances</strong> are ideal for compute-intensive workloads, including those that need access to high-speed, low-latency local storage like video encoding, image manipulation, and other forms of media processing.</li> \n <li><strong>M8id instances</strong> are best for workloads that require a balance of compute and memory resources along with high-speed, low-latency local block storage, including data logging, media processing, and medium-sized data stores.</li> \n <li><strong>R8id instances</strong> are designed for memory-intensive workloads such as large-scale SQL and NoSQL databases, in-memory databases, large-scale data analytics, and AI inference.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>C8id, M8id, and R8id instances now scale up to <strong>96xlarge</strong> (versus <strong>32xlarge</strong> sizes in the sixth generation) with up to 384 vCPUs, 3TiB of memory, and 22.8TB of local storage that make it easier to scale up applications and drive greater efficiencies. These instances also offer two bare metal sizes (<strong>metal-48xl</strong> and <strong>metal-96xl</strong>), allowing you to right size your instances and deploy your most performance sensitive workloads that benefit from direct access to physical resources.</p> \n<p>The instances are available in 11 sizes per family, as well as two bare metal configurations each:</p> \n<table> \n <thead> \n  <tr> \n   <th>Instance Name</th> \n   <th>vCPUs</th> \n   <th>Memory (GiB) (C/M/R)</th> \n   <th>Local NVMe storage (GB)</th> \n   <th>Network bandwidth (Gbps)</th> \n   <th>EBS bandwidth (Gbps)</th> \n  </tr> \n </thead> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>large</strong></td> \n   <td>2</td> \n   <td>4/8/16*</td> \n   <td>1 x 118</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>4</td> \n   <td>8/16/32*</td> \n   <td>1 x 237</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>2xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>8</td> \n   <td>16/32/64*</td> \n   <td>1 x 474</td> \n   <td>Up to 15</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>4xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>16</td> \n   <td>32/64/128*</td> \n   <td>1 x 950</td> \n   <td>Up to 15</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>8xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>32</td> \n   <td>64/128/256*</td> \n   <td>1 x 1,900</td> \n   <td>15</td> \n   <td>10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>12xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>48</td> \n   <td>96/192/384*</td> \n   <td>1 x 2,850</td> \n   <td>22.5</td> \n   <td>15</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>16xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>128/256/512*</td> \n   <td>1 x 3,800</td> \n   <td>30</td> \n   <td>20</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>24xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>96</td> \n   <td>192/384/768*</td> \n   <td>2 x 2,850</td> \n   <td>40</td> \n   <td>30</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>32xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>128</td> \n   <td>256/512/1024*</td> \n   <td>2 x 3,800</td> \n   <td>50</td> \n   <td>40</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>48xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>192</td> \n   <td>384/768/1536*</td> \n   <td>3 x 3,800</td> \n   <td>75</td> \n   <td>60</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>96xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>384</td> \n   <td>768/1536/3072*</td> \n   <td>6 x 3,800</td> \n   <td>100</td> \n   <td>80</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>metal-48xl</strong></td> \n   <td>192</td> \n   <td>384/768/1536*</td> \n   <td>3 x 3,800</td> \n   <td>75</td> \n   <td>60</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>metal-96xl</strong></td> \n   <td>384</td> \n   <td>768/1536/3072*</td> \n   <td>6 x 3,800</td> \n   <td>100</td> \n   <td>80</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p><em>*Memory values are for C8id/M8id/R8id respectively.</em></p> \n<p>These instances support the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/instance-bandwidth-configuration.html?trk=d8ec3b19-0f37-4f8c-8c12-189f913e205c&amp;sc_channel=el\">Instance Bandwidth Configuration (IBC)</a> feature like other eighth-generation instance types, offering flexibility to allocate resources between network and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/?trk=d8ec3b19-0f37-4f8c-8c12-189f913e205c&amp;sc_channel=el\">Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)</a> bandwidth.

Each key is destroyed when the instance is stopped or terminated.</li> \n <li>Local NVMe devices have the same lifetime as the instance they are attached to and do not persist after the instance has been stopped or terminated.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>To learn more, visit <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/nvme-ebs-volumes.html?trk=d8ec3b19-0f37-4f8c-8c12-189f913e205c&amp;sc_channel=el\">Amazon EBS volumes and NVMe</a> in the Amazon EBS User Guide.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Now available</u></strong><br /> Amazon EC2 C8id, M8id and R8id instances are available in US East (N.
