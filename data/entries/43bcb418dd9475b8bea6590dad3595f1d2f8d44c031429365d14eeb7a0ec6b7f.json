If you want to get into the weeds on how to get faster and stronger on the bike, you’ll love this episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My guest is Thomson Remo, lead educator for Watt Bike’s professional division. He’s also an elite-level competitive cyclist, indoor cycling world record holder, and current North American USPA Drug Tested Powerlifting Champion.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p>Thomson develops the protocols used to measure fitness and power, and in this episode he talks about what metrics matter, how to effectively combine resistance and cadence, and what training, lifting, and speed workouts specifically translate into riding faster and longer. If you’re ready to build power and speed, get ready to take notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Wattbike-Atom-smart-indoor-trainer-spin-bike-2020-3.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Wattbike-Atom-smart-indoor-trainer-spin-bike-2020-3.jpg\" alt=\"watt bike atom indoor training bike with smart coaching\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Wattbike-Atom-smart-indoor-trainer-spin-bike-2020-3.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Wattbike-Atom-smart-indoor-trainer-spin-bike-2020-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Wattbike-Atom-smart-indoor-trainer-spin-bike-2020-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Wattbike-Atom-smart-indoor-trainer-spin-bike-2020-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Wattbike-Atom-smart-indoor-trainer-spin-bike-2020-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Wattbike-Atom-smart-indoor-trainer-spin-bike-2020-3-696x464.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Wattbike-Atom-smart-indoor-trainer-spin-bike-2020-3-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Wattbike-Atom-smart-indoor-trainer-spin-bike-2020-3-630x420.jpg 630w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven’t seen it, the <a href=\"https://us.wattbike.com/products/wattbike-atom\" target=\"_blank\">Watt Bike Atom</a> is a very smart, precise indoor bike that’s used by USA Cycling and the UCI for talent identification, and their professional division supplies gyms and professional sporting teams around the world.
