The extent of the compromise, along with the ease of exploitation, has earned the CVE-2024-3400 vulnerability the maximum severity rating of 10.0. The ongoing attacks are the latest in a rash of attacks aimed at firewalls, VPNs, and file-transfer appliances, which are popular targets because of their wealth of vulnerabilities and direct pipeline into the most sensitive parts of a network.</p>\n<h2>“Highly capable” UTA0218 likely to be joined by others</h2>\n<p>The zero-day is present in PAN-OS 10.2, PAN-OS 11.0, and/or PAN-OS 11.1 firewalls when they are configured to use both the GlobalProtect gateway and device telemetry. Palo Alto Networks has yet to patch the vulnerability but is urging affected customers to follow the workaround and mitigation guidance provided <a href=\"https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-3400\">here</a>. The advice includes enabling Threat ID 95187 for those with subscriptions to the company’s Threat Prevention service and ensuring vulnerability protection has been applied to their GlobalProtect interface. When that’s not possible, customers should temporarily disable telemetry until a patch is available.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017043#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017043&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"02fd809408f851eaa96d07d8aa651675e05a2b81479e2b4883ffb5060c2f498d","category":"Tech"}
