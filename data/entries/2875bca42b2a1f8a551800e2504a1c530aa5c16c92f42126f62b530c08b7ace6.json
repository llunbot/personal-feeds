It’s limited to 1080p\n30fps but I was surprised to see how sharp it was AND that it\nretained Dolby Vision.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interesting to see Cinematic mode in the hands of a talented videographer. Easily the best “in the wild” Cinematic mode video I’ve seen. (Explicit lyrics in the song.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/22/cinematic-mode-morrison-video\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2875bca42b2a1f8a551800e2504a1c530aa5c16c92f42126f62b530c08b7ace6","category":"Tech"}
