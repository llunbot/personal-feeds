{"title":"Wayne Ma at The Information: ‘How Apple Fumbled Siri’s AI Makeover’","link":"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-fumbled-siris-ai-makeover?rc=jfy0lk","date":1744322308000,"content":"\n<p>Blockbuster report by Wayne Ma for The Information (paywalled and pricey, alas):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But an equally important factor was the conflicting personalities\nwithin Apple, according to multiple people who worked in the AI\nand software engineering groups. More than half a dozen former\nApple employees who worked in the AI and machine-learning group\nled by Giannandrea — known as AI/ML for short — told The\nInformation that poor leadership is to blame for its problems with\nexecution. They singled out Walker as lacking both ambition and an\nappetite for taking risks on designing future versions of the\nvoice assistant.</p>\n\n<p>Among engineers inside Apple, the AI group’s relaxed culture and\nstruggles with execution have even earned it an uncharitable\nnickname, a play on its initials: AIMLess.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ouch. Ma names names, and the report is full of scoops:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One Siri leader often criticized by colleagues was Walker, who\njoined Apple in 2013 and became responsible for its daily\noperations at the end of 2022. In the eyes of his critics, Walker\nwas unwilling to take big risks on Siri and focused on metrics\nthat didn’t move the needle much on its performance, rather than\nhaving a grand vision for overhauling the voice assistant.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, he often celebrated small wins such as reducing by\nminute percentages the delay between when someone asked Siri a\nquestion and when it responded, former Apple engineers said.\nAnother pet Walker project was removing the “hey” from the “hey\nSiri” voice command used to invoke the assistant, which took more\nthan two years to accomplish, they said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What Ma describes is a scenario where Walker missed the fact that the whole forest sucked and didn’t work, while focusing on one or two nice trees. Faster response times are a win, no question — but a <em>small</em> win, only at the margin. Faster wrong or useless (or even just mediocre) answers are, I guess, better than slower wrong/useless answers, but the overall result is a loss. Fast helpful answers are the goal, obviously, but slow helpful answers are infinitely better than fast useless ones. (I’m not even sure eliminating the requirement to use the verbal “hey” prefix was a win at all. It’s purely anecdotal and personal, but I think I get more unwanted invocations now than I did when “Hey Siri” was the required prompt. Like when I’m talking to someone and start a sentence with “Seriously …” Siri will kick in on one of my devices with a “Sorry, I didn’t catch that.”)</p>\n\n<p>One last nugget:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Other resentments also built up. Some in the software engineering\ngroup were annoyed by the higher pay and faster promotions their\ncolleagues in the AI group were receiving. And they were bitter\nthat some engineers in the AI group seemed to be able to take\nlonger vacations and leave early on Fridays, while they faced\nmore-punishing work schedules.</p>\n\n<p>Distrust between the two groups got so bad that earlier this year\none of Giannandrea’s deputies asked engineers to extensively\ndocument the development of a joint project so that if it failed,\nFederighi’s group couldn’t scapegoat the AI team.</p>\n\n<p>It didn’t help the relations between the groups when Federighi\nbegan amassing his own team of hundreds of machine-learning\nengineers that goes by the name Intelligent Systems and is run by\none of Federighi’s top deputies, Sebastien Marineau-Mes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hundreds of engineers for a machine learning team outside Apple’s AI/ML division sounds like the definition of dysfunction. I really doubt Federighi has also assembled a large team of silicon engineers outside Johny Srouji’s division, because Srouji’s team is not merely functional, but rightly regarded as one the highest-functioning engineering divisions in any field in the world.</p>\n\n<p>I wish I could share a gift link to Ma’s report, but The Information’s gift links for subscribers only work for up to three people.
