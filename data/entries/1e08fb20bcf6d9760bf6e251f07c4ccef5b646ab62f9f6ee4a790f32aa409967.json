This \"spatial computer\" marked Apple's first brand new product line in years, seeking to blend the physical and digital worlds. Powered by the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> and R1 chips, the Vision Pro uses over a dozen sensors and cameras to map environments in real-time, boasting two high-resolution displays for immersive experiences and advanced hand-tracking.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn March, Apple refreshed its popular <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> lineup, unveiling new 13- and 15-inch models powered by the M3 chip. May brought significant updates to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> lineup. Apple launched the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> 6, now available in 11-inch and 13-inch sizes and powered by the ‌M2‌ chip, and the redesigned <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, featuring OLED displays for the first time and the debut of the M4 chip. Accompanying these devices was the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> Pro, offering precision enhancements and haptic feedback for creative professionals, and the Magic Keyboard for ‌iPad Pro‌, which further bridges the gap between iPads and laptops.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple hosted its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, unveiling <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> with enhanced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a> customization, a redesigned Control Center, and more. The company also previewed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/\">watchOS 11</a>, tvOS 18, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/\">visionOS 2</a>, but the biggest announcement was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> – a new suite of AI tools for Apple devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs usual, September was packed with major announcements. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> lineup debuted, with the standard models embracing Pro-like features such as the Camera Control button, Action button, and spatial video capture. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max gained bigger displays, longer battery life, an improved ultra wide camera, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 launched in September, showcasing a thinner design, while the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> gained a black color option and a new titanium Milanese Loop. Apple also debuted the fourth-generation AirPods, now with optional ANC, and a USB-C version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a>. October saw a minor refresh of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> with the A17 Pro chip and ‌Apple Intelligence‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple closed the year with a focus on its Mac lineup, bringing the M4 family of chips to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>. Most notably, the ‌Mac mini‌ was completely redesigned with an even smaller enclosure measuring just 5 inches by 5 inches. The ‌iMac‌ and ‌MacBook Pro‌ also gained enhanced cameras and a nano-texture display option for the first time, along with a series of other small but significant improvements. Alongside this, Apple finally refreshed its Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard with USB-C connectivity.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhat do you think about Apple's releases this year?
