Scott calls it their “<em>most impact-resistant component ever</em>“. They designed it first to protect the motor. But thanks to rubber contact against the motor itself, it also damps motor noise for quieter eMTB riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, the new 800Wh PowerTube battery gets tucked inside the oversized downtube, behind a tool-free but secure protective easy-access door.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_transparent-frame-showing-shock-inside-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_transparent-frame-showing-shock-inside-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Scott Patron eRIDE eMTB all mountain ebike, translucent X-ray frame\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_transparent-frame-showing-shock-inside-jpg.webp 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_transparent-frame-showing-shock-inside-297x186.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_transparent-frame-showing-shock-inside-1536x960.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_transparent-frame-showing-shock-inside-120x75.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_transparent-frame-showing-shock-inside-768x480.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_transparent-frame-showing-shock-inside-2048x1280.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, the new Patron eRide eMTB gets the same upside-down shock hidden from mud inside the downtube like all the latest <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=scott+mountain+bike\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Bold-inspired mountain bikes</a>. Only this time, there’s a removable cover at the front of the seattube for easier shock access, taking cues from the previous Patron.

But that’s really just to give them more flexibility to play around. So then, the Super Trail ST versions can get a longer travel fork pushing it to a 64.9° head angle, and effectively bringing Reach back to what it was before. But that’s all in the standard -0.6° headset starting position.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_geometry-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2100\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_geometry-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Scott Patron eRIDE eMTB all mountain ebike, adjustable geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_geometry-jpg.webp 2100w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_geometry-297x283.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_geometry-1536x1463.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_geometry-120x114.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_geometry-768x731.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_geometry-2048x1950.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, thanks to a +/-0.6° adjustable headset, buyers can easily further tweak how the want the new ebike to handle riding the steepest terrain. (New Patrons all also come with the 0° no-offset headset cups if they’d prefer an in-between position.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Carbon or Aluminum, plus some Carbon/Alloy combinations</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MY25-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_carbon-or-alloy-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MY25-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_carbon-or-alloy-scaled.webp\" alt=\"2025 Scott Patron eRIDE eMTB all mountain ebike, in carbon or aluminum alloy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MY25-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_carbon-or-alloy-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MY25-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_carbon-or-alloy-297x124.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MY25-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_carbon-or-alloy-1536x640.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MY25-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_carbon-or-alloy-120x50.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MY25-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_carbon-or-alloy-768x320.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MY25-Scott-Patron-eRIDE-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_carbon-or-alloy-2048x853.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, integration is all the rage, and Scott is all about hiding everything inside. But it’s also pretty interesting that they managed to tuck shock, motor &amp; battery seamlessly inside the frame – both with carbon and alloy mainframes. Balancing weight savings and cost, Scott also has a carbon and aluminum version of the rear triangle as well. Although, only the more aggressive riding ST version gets the option of carbon seat &amp; chainstays.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a

with their all-new Patron eMTB. Two styles based on the same main frames, and 6 models in all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The standard “do-it-all” Scott Patron eRide eMTB sticks with matching 150mm travel front &amp; rear and versatile Maxxis trail tires. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or the super trail Patron eRide ST ratchets that up to 170mm of fork travel to the 150mm rear travel, and gives them extra grip of Schwalbe’s latest Radial mountain bike tire tech and extra sticky rubber. Built for “aggressive technical trails and handling bigger impacts.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a
