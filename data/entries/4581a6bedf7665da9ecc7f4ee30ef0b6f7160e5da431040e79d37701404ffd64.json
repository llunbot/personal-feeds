{"title":"Apple Working on visionOS Support for Godot Game Engine","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/23/apple-visionos-godot-game-engine/","date":1745444340000,"content":"Apple engineers have offered to <a href=\"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/105628\">contribute Vision Pro support</a> to the Godot engine, which is a free, open source game engine that's available to game creators as an alternative to Unity and Unreal. Godot is cross-platform and supports PCs, mobile devices, the web, and more at the current time, but with Apple's contributions, games made with Godot could run natively on the Vision Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-vision-pro-orange.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nOn GitHub, a member of the visionOS engineering team said that Apple wants to help bring Vision Pro integration to Godot, with the aim of developing a visionOS VR plugin. Apple engineers have already started contributing to the project, and have pledged to continue development based on community feedback.\r<br />\n<blockquote>First, I'd like to mention that we're really excited to be working with the Godot community on adding visionOS support. We've attempted to follow Godot's coding standards and a high-quality bar for our contributions. We hope that our contributions align with Godot's goals. Lastly, even though we have tried to split the changes into smaller self-contained PRs, we acknowledge that some of these PRs can be of considerable size.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe're very happy to iterate on our PRs after receiving feedback and suggestions from the community.</blockquote>\r<br />\nThe Vision Pro has so far seen lackluster sales and waning interest from Apple users, both due to the high cost and the lack of content. By providing free tools that would let Godot developers create immersive visionOS experiences, Apple could grow the number of games on the platform.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is working on future versions of the Vision Pro, so laying the groundwork for development early will benefit the headset's longer term prospects.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/23/apple-visionos-godot-game-engine/\">Apple Working on visionOS Support for Godot Game Engine</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-working-on-visionos-support-for-godot-game-engine.2455849/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4581a6bedf7665da9ecc7f4ee30ef0b6f7160e5da431040e79d37701404ffd64","category":"Apple"}
