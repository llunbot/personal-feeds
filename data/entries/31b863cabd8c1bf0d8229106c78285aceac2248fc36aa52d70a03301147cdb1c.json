{"title":"Why Are News Organizations Giving Any Credence to Elon Musk’s Claims About Tesla’s Previewed Self-Driving Taxi and Bus?","link":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-musk-unveil-robotaxis-amid-fanfare-skepticism-2024-10-10/","date":1728664985000,"content":"\n<p>Abhirup Roy and Akash Sriram, reporting for Reuters:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>CEO Elon Musk showcased on Thursday a long-awaited robotaxi with\ntwo gull-wing doors and no steering wheel or pedals and surprised\nwith robovan, betting on a shift in focus from low-priced\nmass-market cars to robotic vehicles. At a glitzy unveiling, Musk\nreached the stage in a “Cybercab” to be produced from 2026 -\neventually in high volume — and priced under $30,000. He then\nintroduced the robovan which can carry up to 20 people though\noffered few further details.</p>\n\n<p>But Musk, who has a record of missing projections — and himself\nsaid he tended to be optimistic with time frames — did not say how\nquickly Tesla could ramp up robotaxi production, clear inevitable\nregulatory hurdles or implement a business plan to leapfrog\nrobotaxi rivals such as Alphabet’s Waymo.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even with the disclaimer of Musk’s “record of missing projections”, this is far too much credence. The availability dates, the prices — they’re all just made up. It’s a complete distraction from the fact that Tesla is way behind. Waymo is actually operating in four cities today. Somewhere in San Francisco or Austin, there’s probably a Daring Fireball reader reading this post while riding in a self-driving Waymo.</p>\n\n<p>Wake me up when Tesla ships any of these vehicles. Until then, <a href=\"https://www.techmeme.com/241011/p15#a241011p15\">stop using the present tense</a> about any of it. It’s all vaporware for now. (And the stock market isn’t buying it — on a day when markets are flat, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-tesla-tsla-stock-falling-151918776.html\">Tesla is down 8 percent</a> as I type.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/11/musk-credence-cybertaxi\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"31b863cabd8c1bf0d8229106c78285aceac2248fc36aa52d70a03301147cdb1c","category":"Tech"}
