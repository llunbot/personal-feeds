A raised lip protects the front of the display, and all buttons are protected but usable. It offers 12-foot drop protection without adding a significant amount of bulk.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/caseborne-r-series-details.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nCaseBorne also makes the R Series cases <a href=\"https://getcaseborne.com/products/iphone-13-case-kevlar-aramid-fiber-aluminum-frame-12-feet-drop-protection\">with a Kevlar/Aramid Fiber frame</a> as an alternative to the clear polycarbonate, with this version available in black or red and priced at $40.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor those who need maximum protection, CaseBorne offers <a href=\"https://getcaseborne.com/products/iphone-13-rugged-case-military-grade-21-feet-drop-proof\">the Vanguard Series cases</a>, which are thicker and more rugged. Priced at $30, the V Series cases offer three layers of protection and can keep the iPhone safe from drops as high as 21 feet.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/caseborne-v-series-info.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThere's a shock absorbent TPU material that combines with a hard plastic shell for total device protection, and the honeycomb design and reinforced corners provide additional protection for the iPhone's weak spots. There's a protective screen and the sides protect the buttons, plus plug-ins keep ports safe from dust.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/caseborne-v-series-details.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe V Series cases come in black, orange, purple, and red, and there's a built-in kickstand at the back that can be pulled out when using the iPhone to watch videos.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/caseborne-v-series-kickstand-fixed.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nCaseBorne is planning to have a full range of cases available on Amazon when the iPhone launches, with 50 percent discounted pricing for those who purchase first. Details are <a href=\"https://getcaseborne.com/pages/iphone-13-cases-pre-launch\">available on the CaseBorne website</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/caseborne-v-series-design.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWe have one iPhone 13 to give away, and the winner will be able to pick the color of their choice.
