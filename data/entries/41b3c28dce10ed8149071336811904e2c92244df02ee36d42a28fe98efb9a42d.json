An IPX7 waterproof rating and Li-ion rechargeable battery make for a worry-free ride in any conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/win-it-weekly-rotor-2inpower-dual-sided-power-meter/\">Read More</a>","author":"CyclingTips","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"41b3c28dce10ed8149071336811904e2c92244df02ee36d42a28fe98efb9a42d","category":"Cycling"}
