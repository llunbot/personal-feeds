They say it can seal holes up to 7mm at 110psi.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/muc-off-road-gravel-tubeless-tire-sealant-2.jpg\"><img width=\"1400\" height=\"1038\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/muc-off-road-gravel-tubeless-tire-sealant-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/muc-off-road-gravel-tubeless-tire-sealant-2.jpg 1400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/muc-off-road-gravel-tubeless-tire-sealant-2-297x220.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/muc-off-road-gravel-tubeless-tire-sealant-2-120x89.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/muc-off-road-gravel-tubeless-tire-sealant-2-768x569.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also completely ammonia- and allergen-free (it uses synthetic, not natural, latex), non-toxic, lasts up to six months, and works in temps as low as -15ºC (5ºF).
