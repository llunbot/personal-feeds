Plus, on top of those new 7L waterproof packs that I strapped to my fork, there’s also a similarly-made 9L Atlas dry bag that straps securely to the top of a rear rack to get the weight of your gear lower than reckless bikepacking bags. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been testing out the new Flip cages and fork bags on our snowy winter trails. And they offer a great way to strap some extra warm clothes on the bike just in case, but don’t get in the way when you leave the bags at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Old Man Mountain FLiP Cages &amp; Hemlock fork bags</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_prototype-Chiru-Nanulak-expedition-fat-bike.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2200\" height=\"1320\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_prototype-Chiru-Nanulak-expedition-fat-bike.webp\" alt=\"Old Man Mountain FLiP Cages &amp; Hemlock fork bags, on prototype Chiru Nanulak fat bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_prototype-Chiru-Nanulak-expedition-fat-bike.webp 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_prototype-Chiru-Nanulak-expedition-fat-bike-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_prototype-Chiru-Nanulak-expedition-fat-bike-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_prototype-Chiru-Nanulak-expedition-fat-bike-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_prototype-Chiru-Nanulak-expedition-fat-bike-768x461.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_prototype-Chiru-Nanulak-expedition-fat-bike-2048x1229.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos/Cory Benson)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Old Man Mountain set out to create a new modular, lightweight quick-release system for attaching more gear to your bike. Lighter and lower-profile that their conventional rack setups, they came up with the FLiP system. A relatively simple cage that “<em>like all OMM products [is] secure, silent, and ready for any riding condition</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These new cages are Old Man Mountain’s first ever cargo cages, but they are a lot more than that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The FLiP in their name reveals their versatility. Short for <em>Fast Lock in Place</em>, the thick plastic cages do double-duty as both cargo cage <em>AND</em> a mounting bracket for the new OMM quick release Hemlock bags. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_on-Manitou-fat-bike-fork-in-the-snow.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2100\" height=\"1400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_on-Manitou-fat-bike-fork-in-the-snow.webp\" alt=\"Old Man Mountain FLiP Cages &amp; Hemlock fork bags, front view on Manitou Mastodon fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_on-Manitou-fat-bike-fork-in-the-snow.webp 2100w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_on-Manitou-fat-bike-fork-in-the-snow-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_on-Manitou-fat-bike-fork-in-the-snow-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_on-Manitou-fat-bike-fork-in-the-snow-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_on-Manitou-fat-bike-fork-in-the-snow-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_on-Manitou-fat-bike-fork-in-the-snow-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_on-Manitou-fat-bike-fork-in-the-snow-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_on-Manitou-fat-bike-fork-in-the-snow-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Old Man Mountain describe them as “<em>the first quick detach mounts that are also a cargo cage</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, clipped onto the cages, the bags are also an all-new construction for Old Man Mountain. OMM combine tough hypalon lower sections for durability and to hold their shape, then lighter but still waterproof upper fabric makes the bags easy to cinch down for smaller loads.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>First Riding Review</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_quick-release-hook-detail.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2100\" height=\"1400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_quick-release-hook-detail.webp\" alt=\"Old Man Mountain FLiP Cages &amp; Hemlock fork bags, quick release interfCE\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_quick-release-hook-detail.webp 2100w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_quick-release-hook-detail-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_quick-release-hook-detail-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_quick-release-hook-detail-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_quick-release-hook-detail-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_quick-release-hook-detail-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_quick-release-hook-detail-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_quick-release-hook-detail-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I bolted a couple of the new Flip cargo cages to the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-look-old-man-mountain-axle-pack-puts-bikepacking-anything-cages-on-any-fork/\" target=\"_blank\">OMM Fork Packs that I already reviewed</a> last year, for extra winter gear hauling. I mostly have been carrying around bulky but light extra clothing – extra insulated jacket, warmer gloves, insulated caps &amp; buffs – and ride snacks. And it has been great to have the gear pre-packed off the bike, then easily snapped into place to be extra prepared for longer, colder rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just slip the lower hook on the back of your bag into place in the slot of the FLiP cage, push the top lug into its keyed slot on the cage, and rotate it 90° to lock securely in place. The whole cage and mount interface is made of oversized injection-molded nylon, which makes it simple to use and tough enough to haul up to 4.5kg (9.9lb) per cage/bag combo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And since there’s a tiny bit of stretch in nylon, the twist lock mechanism feels very secure and doesn’t move or rattle as you ride over rough terrain. Plus, it’s stood up to some pretty cold riding for me too, without getting stiff or brittle at lower temperatures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>First Impressions</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages_on-a-fat-bike-Manitou-Mastodon-with-fork-packs.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2100\" height=\"1400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages_on-a-fat-bike-Manitou-Mastodon-with-fork-packs.webp\" alt=\"Old Man Mountain FLiP Cages riding in the snow\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages_on-a-fat-bike-Manitou-Mastodon-with-fork-packs.webp 2100w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages_on-a-fat-bike-Manitou-Mastodon-with-fork-packs-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages_on-a-fat-bike-Manitou-Mastodon-with-fork-packs-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages_on-a-fat-bike-Manitou-Mastodon-with-fork-packs-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages_on-a-fat-bike-Manitou-Mastodon-with-fork-packs-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages_on-a-fat-bike-Manitou-Mastodon-with-fork-packs-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages_on-a-fat-bike-Manitou-Mastodon-with-fork-packs-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-FLiP-Cages_on-a-fat-bike-Manitou-Mastodon-with-fork-packs-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m really quite happy with how out-of-the-way the cages are without the bags installed, so I don’t even notice them when I leave the bags at home. It doesn’t make a big difference using the optional foot or not to me. I have the foot installed on the driveside where there’s plenty of other stuff hanging off the bike. Then, my think was to leave the optional cargo foot off on the non-driveside where I’m more likely to be pushing the bike through a snow drift anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of OMM’s biggest core values is to create durable gear that adventure and bikepacking riders can rely on, so they say it took quite a while the get these perfect. And I’m certainly satisfied with them so far. I also use (and have used) a few other anything-style cargo cages, and these actually feel a bit more robust than most, even though they are just made of plastic. But the oversized tube shapes and specific strap slots make me feel better about really cinching down a strap to secure a bottle or stuff sack in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Old Man Mountain also recognizes and appreciates the wide-ranging variety of different bikepackers’ preferred setups. So OMM are also offering the FLiP cage &amp; mount hardware up to other bikepacking bag makers, who want to share the new quick release interface.

But I did fit it onto a commuter bike rack and stuffed a bit of gear inside. Plus, OMM stuck in on a dropbar Chiru adventure bike for some good photos of what it will look like in use. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially interesting to me as I’m using the Hemlock bags as fork-mounted mini-panniers, that’s not the only way to use them. Since the Old Man Mountain Elkhorn rear rack also has anything cage mounts on its vertical legs, OMM mounted a couple of Flip cages on there too. And then, you could run another set of Hemlock bags as rear panniers, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>OMM Atlas tech specs</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Atlas-rack-pack_270g-actual-weight.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Atlas-rack-pack_270g-actual-weight.webp\" alt=\"Old Man Mountain Atlas rack pack bikepacking bag, 270g weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Atlas-rack-pack_270g-actual-weight.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Atlas-rack-pack_270g-actual-weight-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Atlas-rack-pack_270g-actual-weight-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Atlas-rack-pack_270g-actual-weight-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Atlas-rack-pack_270g-actual-weight-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>9-liter storage capacity, not as compressible as the Hemlock bags</li>\n\n\n\n<li>max weight determined by your rack, not the bag</li>\n\n\n\n<li>roll-top closure on the back end, with a plenty-wide opening</li>\n\n\n\n<li>fully waterproof, seam-welded TPU-coated construction</li>\n\n\n\n<li>abrasion-resistant Hypalon base and side reinforcements</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4 grippy straps with locking buckles secure it to almost any flat-top rack</li>\n\n\n\n<li>external bungee zig-zag loop to stow more easy-access gear on top</li>\n\n\n\n<li>PFAS/PFC-free</li>\n\n\n\n<li>275g claimed (<em>270g actual</em>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>sold separately / individually</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Flip-Cages-Atlas-rack-pack-Hemlock-fork-bags_on-Chiru-gravel-bike.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Flip-Cages-Atlas-rack-pack-Hemlock-fork-bags_on-Chiru-gravel-bike.webp\" alt=\"Old Man Mountain FLiP Cages and Hemlock &amp; Atlas bikepacking bags\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Flip-Cages-Atlas-rack-pack-Hemlock-fork-bags_on-Chiru-gravel-bike.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Flip-Cages-Atlas-rack-pack-Hemlock-fork-bags_on-Chiru-gravel-bike-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Flip-Cages-Atlas-rack-pack-Hemlock-fork-bags_on-Chiru-gravel-bike-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Flip-Cages-Atlas-rack-pack-Hemlock-fork-bags_on-Chiru-gravel-bike-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Flip-Cages-Atlas-rack-pack-Hemlock-fork-bags_on-Chiru-gravel-bike-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Flip-Cages-Atlas-rack-pack-Hemlock-fork-bags_on-Chiru-gravel-bike-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Flip-Cages-Atlas-rack-pack-Hemlock-fork-bags_on-Chiru-gravel-bike-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photo/Old Man Mountain)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Old Man Mountain describes the new Atlas Deck Pack as a great alternative for riders that might be struggling with some of the limitations of… or struggles with large bikepacking saddlepacks. Attached to one of OMM’s light but adaptable rear racks, this 9L bag won’t sway or bounce around as you ride. Plus, it will lower your center of mass on the bike, and won’t interfere with the use of a dropper seatpost!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Old Man Mountain FLiP, Hemlock &amp; Atlas – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Flip-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_riding-in-the-snow.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Flip-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_riding-in-the-snow.webp\" alt=\"Old Man Mountain FLiP Cages &amp; Hemlock fork bags, riding in the snow\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Flip-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_riding-in-the-snow.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Flip-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_riding-in-the-snow-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Flip-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_riding-in-the-snow-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Flip-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_riding-in-the-snow-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Old-Man-Mountain-Flip-Cages-and-Hemlock-fork-bags_riding-in-the-snow-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can pick up a pair of the new Old Man Mountain Flip cargo cages for $80 (for 2 cages, including the removable cargo foot) if you want to use them to haul gear like any other cargo cage with the future possibility of adding on a quick release FLiP bag or other accessory. But you’ll have to wait a couple weeks until the cages-alone are in stock. Or for $175 you buy a pair of 7L Hemlock bags now, which include with a pair of Flip cages (2 quick release packs &amp; 2 cages with the optional cargo foot.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, Old Man Mountain describes the Hemlock bag as their “first FLIP compatible offering” suggesting you will likely get more things to mount to your cages in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9L Atlas Rack Pack is completely a standalone product at $95 and requires a separate rear rack to mount it. But OMM designed it for a unified look if you also get Hemlock bags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://oldmanmountain.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>OldManMountain.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/old-man-mountain-flip-cage-hemlock-atlas-packs-make-quick-work-of-hauling-more-gear/\">Old Man Mountain FLiP Cage, Hemlock &amp; Atlas Packs Make Quick Work of Hauling More Gear</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"30db3d44e3724bdef17b7edffb60db4d5629bdf0bee72ce6059a2766b97be7c2","category":"Cycling"}
