We were trying to answer two questions: How long can Mac owners reasonably expect to receive software updates when they buy a new computer? And were Intel Macs being dropped more aggressively now that the Apple Silicon transition was in full swing?</p>\n<p>The answer to the second question was a tentative \"yes,\" and now that we know the official support list for macOS Sonoma, the trendline is clear.</p>\n\n<p>Macs introduced between 2009 and 2015 could expect to receive seven or eight years of macOS updates—that is, new major versions with new features, like Ventura or Sonoma—plus another two years of security-only updates that fix vulnerabilities and keep Safari up to date. Macs released in 2016 and 2017 are only receiving about six years' worth of macOS updates, plus another two years of security updates. That's about a two-year drop, compared to most Macs released between 2009 and 2013.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944177#p3\">Read 37 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944177&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"59bf118210f75522dbf0d0f5485d79b57102c8db39869a694deab274c9703ad1","category":"Tech"}
