Users can also see details about when the battery was produced and when it was first used. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nCode previously found in iPadOS 17.5 beta software <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ipados-17-5-beta-battery-health-code/\">referenced the Battery Health menu</a>, and it was indeed suggested that it may be limited to Apple's new iPads. Notably, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/check-battery-cycle-count-iphone-15/\">Cycle Count</a> readout and the option to more <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-15-battery-charging-limit/\">strictly prevent charging beyond 80%</a> were up until now exclusive features of the iPhone 15 series, and cannot be found on older iPhones either.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iculture-ipad-2024-battery-health-menu.jpg\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1160\" /><div><em>Image credit: iCulture</em></div>\r<br />\nThe 80% Limit is separate from the Optimized Battery Charging feature on earlier iPhones, which intelligently delays charging past 80% until a more appropriate time by learning the device's daily charging routine. When the 80% hard limit is enabled, the iPad will never charge beyond that percentage, except on rare occasions to \"maintain accurate battery state-of-charge estimates.\" Apple <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-asia/108055#:~:text=When%20you%20choose%2080%25%20Limit,reaches%20about%2080%20percent%20again.\">says</a> reducing the time that a battery is fully charged can reduce the wear on the battery and improve its lifespan.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro\">iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/14/2024-ipad-air-pro-battery-cycle-count/\">New iPad Air and iPad Pro Feature Battery Health Menu Including Cycle Count and 80% Charging Limit Option</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipad-air-and-ipad-pro-feature-battery-health-menu-including-cycle-count-and-80-charging-limit-option.2426276/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"df540331a2fefae34b877ddb4bba40e2508d2c4beb5a984cd8eba2e73179b935","category":"Apple"}
