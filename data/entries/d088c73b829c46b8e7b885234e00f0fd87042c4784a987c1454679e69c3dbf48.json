However, it may not charge over\nUSB either. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/143l48d/iphone_stops_charging_when_using_as_continuity/\">Several users in a Reddit conversation</a>\nreported that their iPhones lost charge during Continuity Camera\nsessions, even while plugged in.</p>\n\n<p>I suspect that Continuity Camera taxes the processor sufficiently\nthat the iPhone heats up. (It’s always warm when I take it off the\nmount after a meeting.) Since MagSafe charging also causes the\niPhone to get warm — warmer than USB-based charging — Apple’s\nbattery optimization system may be putting charging on hold to\nprotect the battery from thermal overload. Which is good, if\nunexpected in the moment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/31/iphones-pause-magsafe-charging-during-continuity-camera\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d088c73b829c46b8e7b885234e00f0fd87042c4784a987c1454679e69c3dbf48","category":"Tech"}
