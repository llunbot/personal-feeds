But these titles apparently just weren't difficult enough for <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/dinossindgeil\">streamer dinossindgeil</a> (aka <a href=\"https://x.com/dinossindgeil\">Nico</a>) who spent the weekend beating seven of FromSoft's most punishing titles without taking a single hit or leveling up even once.</p>\n<p>Nico's conquest of what he calls \"The God Run 3\" <a href=\"https://x.com/dinossindgeil/status/1592208311344037888\">dates back to 2022</a>, when he took down all three Dark Souls games as well as <em>Demon's Souls</em>, <em>Bloodborne</em>, <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>, and <em>Elden Ring</em> live on his Twitch stream without sustaining any damage from enemies. Back then, though, Nico relied at least a little bit on grinding leveled-up characters and high-end gear to make the game's most difficult bosses a bit more manageable. Even with that advantage, though, a successful God Run 3 completion took Nico 120 days of real-time effort due to frequent restarts whenever he took a single hit.</p>\n<p>This time around, Nico cranked up the difficulty even further by deciding not to level his characters even once (though he was able to increase his stats and abilities in some games with level 1-accessible items and weapons). After <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2331460758\">his first level 1 God Run attempt two months ago</a>, Nico's efforts culminated in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ripk0RYwEgo\">roughly 11-hour</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whMssrH1uX4\">multi-day marathon run</a> over the weekend, which saw <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgMBmsNiUJY\">Nico break down in tears</a> at the end of the ordeal.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/the-god-run-dark-souls-player-beats-seven-games-at-level-1-without-taking-a-hit/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/the-god-run-dark-souls-player-beats-seven-games-at-level-1-without-taking-a-hit/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"296757c2df41b527005be6804ecf845b223880cdf8f6b44e7e4afb9ddced01ce","category":"Tech"}
