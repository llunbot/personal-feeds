{"title":"1Password Launches Recovery Codes and Simplified Sign-In Process","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/1password-launches-recovery-codes/","date":1718926839000,"content":"Popular password management app 1Password <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/introducing-1password-recovery-codes/\">today announced the launch</a> of two new features that are designed to make the app more user friendly. 1Password is improving the sign-in process on new devices and adding the ability to recover an account when a master password and secret key are lost.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nWith recovery codes, 1Password is providing a failsafe that will let customers back into their accounts in the event that a password is lost. 1Password already provides an Emergency Kit PDF that includes a Secret Key, and users are instructed to keep the Secret Key safe. The Secret Key allows for access to a 1Password account if the master password isn't available, but prior to now, if the Secret Key was also lost, there was no option for account recovery.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n1Password users can now log in and generate a recovery code, which can be used to regain access to an account. The company recommends that customers go through the recovery code process immediately, as a recovery code can't be generated after a user is locked out of their 1Password account.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAfter a recovery code has been created, it can be used at any time to regain access to a 1Password account, though users will need access to the email address associated with their 1Password account.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGenerating a recovery code can be done by going to the Manage Accounts section, selecting Sign-in and Recovery, and choosing the \"Set up recovery code option.\" 1Password recommends that recovery codes be stored in a safe and accessible place.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n1Password is also testing an updated sign-in experience in a beta capacity, with the new method aimed at making it easier to log in on a new device or through a web browser. When logging in somewhere new, users can now choose the Scan QR Code option from the top left account menu in 1Password and scan a QR code on the new device to log in.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nThe new sign-in option is available in beta and nightly release channels on 1Password for desktop and TestFlight for iOS. Recovery codes are available to all 1Password users.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/1password/\">1Password</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/1password-launches-recovery-codes/\">1Password Launches Recovery Codes and Simplified Sign-In Process</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/1password-launches-recovery-codes-and-simplified-sign-in-process.2429706/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"16319434caa670dcf2fbd0d0545494ea9f5e7cd4a441e39d094b349707b526b3","category":"Apple"}
