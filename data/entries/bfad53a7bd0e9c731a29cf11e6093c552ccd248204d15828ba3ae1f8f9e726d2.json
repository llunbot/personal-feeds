It was 69 percent effective at 180 days. In terms of protecting against non-severe respiratory disease from RSV, the trial results didn't meet the statistical criteria to find efficacy at 90 days, but data from 180 days suggested an efficacy of around 51 percent.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940392#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940392&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bfad53a7bd0e9c731a29cf11e6093c552ccd248204d15828ba3ae1f8f9e726d2","category":"Tech"}
