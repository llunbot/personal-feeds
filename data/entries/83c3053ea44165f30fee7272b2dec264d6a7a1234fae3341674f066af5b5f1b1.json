Packaging is the final step in semiconductor manufacturing after fabrication, and involves the process of protecting the chip and enabling electrical connections with other devices or components. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple outsources to TSMC the front-end manufacturing phase of fabricating the chips on silicon wafers. Now that fabrication is underway, the packaging is being handled by OSAT (Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test) companies including Taiwan's ASE Group, America's Amkor, and China's JCET. According to the report, ASE was the first to begin mass production, while Amkor and JCET are expected to follow sequentially.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe initial production run is said to be for the base M5 model, rather than Apple's more advanced M5 Pro, M5 Max, and M5 Ultra processors. The OSAT companies mentioned above are said to be currently investing in additional facilities to support the mass production of the high-end models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe M5 series is expected to feature an enhanced ARM architecture and is reportedly being manufactured using TSMC's advanced 3-nanometer process technology. Apple's decision to forgo TSMC's more advanced 2nm process for the M5 chip is believed to be due to cost considerations. However, the high-end versions of the M5 will still feature significant advancements over their M4 equivalents, mainly through the adoption of TSMC's System on Integrated Chip (SoIC) technology.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis 3D chip-stacking approach vertically stacks the chips, which enhances thermal management and reduces electrical leakage compared to traditional 2D designs. Apple is said to have expanded its cooperation with TSMC on the next-generation hybrid SoIC package, which also combines thermoplastic carbon fiber composite molding technology.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe first device to be equipped with the M5 chip is expected to be a new iPad Pro, which will enter mass production in the second half of next year, according to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/m5-ipad-pro-mass-production-late-2025/\">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAssuming Apple maintains its typical upgrade cycle for its custom silicon, here are the devices we're expecting to benefit in chronological order:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n    <li><strong>iPad Pro:</strong> M5 chips could debut in the devices in late 2025 or early-to-mid 2026.</li>\r<br />\n    <li><strong>MacBook Pro:</strong> Models featuring M5 series chips are anticipated in late 2025.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>MacBook Air:</strong> M5 variants will likely arrive in early 2026.</li>\r<br />\n    <li><strong>Apple Vision Pro:</strong> An updated version of the headset incorporating the M5 chip is expected between the fall of 2025 and spring of 2026.</li></ul>References to what are believed to be Apple's M5 chip have already been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/a19-and-m5-chips-discovered/\">discovered</a> in official Apple code.
