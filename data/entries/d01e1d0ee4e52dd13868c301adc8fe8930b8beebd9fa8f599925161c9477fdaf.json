I had expectations knowing this is a well-regarded brand with lots of experience making outdoor gear, and I was not disappointed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been riding in the Dirt Craft jersey and Dirt Craft shorts since spring, and have worn these pieces countless times throughout the spring and summer. Both proved to be very durable garments, despite their lightweight, thin fabrics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the cut was a bit loose on me, the long-sleeved Dirt Craft jersey proved to be a great option for full coverage in a wide range of temperatures. The shorts fit great, felt cool on hot days, and the chamois included with them is very comfortable. In addition to the jersey, shorts, and chamois featured in this article, I also tested a waterproof jacket and riding pants, so watch for my review on those coming soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dirt Craft Bike Jersey: $99</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-front-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1545\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-front-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Patagonia Dirt Craft jersey, front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-front-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-front-233x300.webp 233w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-front-93x120.webp 93w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-front-768x989.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-front-1193x1536.webp 1193w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dirt Craft long-sleeved jersey features Airshed fabric on the shoulders and outer arms, and Capilene Cool Daily fabric on the main body and cuffs. The Capilene fabric offers stretch and breathability, while the Airshed fabric reinforces abrasion-prone areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patagonia tailored this jersey for bike riders with a longer rear hem, long sleeves to ensure proper coverage, and hybrid panel elbows that stretch to accommodate low-profile elbow pads. The cuffs are designed to hold themselves in place if you push them up your arms.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-back-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1545\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-back-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Patagonia Dirt Craft jersey, back\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-back-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-back-233x300.webp 233w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-back-93x120.webp 93w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-back-768x989.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-back-1193x1536.webp 1193w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Men’s and women’s models of the Dirt Craft jersey are available. Men’s sizes range from XS-XXL, and there are five color choices (including the Golden Caramel color I tested). Women’s sizes go from XS-XL, and Patagonia offers three color options.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ride Impressions:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-SF-slab.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-SF-slab.jpg\" alt=\"Patagonia Dirt Craft jersey, SF, slab\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-SF-slab.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-SF-slab-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-SF-slab-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-SF-slab-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-SF-slab-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-SF-slab-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dirt Craft Bike Jersey is a thin, long-sleeve jersey suitable for just about any ride. I wore a size medium (matching the Dirt Roamer Storm jacket I tested), and I found the cut a bit baggy overall. Both the width of the body and the loose-fitting arms are a little excessive on my lean frame. On windy days, the arms did get a bit flappy during rides. The Dirt Craft jersey fit well under the Patagonia jacket, but it could make a better underlayer if it was a bit less baggy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In hindsight I may have fit into a size small jersey, however, I do like the medium’s body and arm length. The body drops well below my waist in the front and back, and the arms are easily long enough to keep my wrists covered in any riding position.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-and-shorts-SF.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-and-shorts-SF.jpg\" alt=\"Patagonia Dirt Craft jersey and shorts, SF, trailside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-and-shorts-SF.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-and-shorts-SF-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-and-shorts-SF-80x120.webp 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-and-shorts-SF-768x1152.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-jersey-and-shorts-SF-1024x1536.webp 1024w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I wouldn’t give the Dirt Craft jersey’s fabric top marks for breathability, as it doesn’t match the airy feel of a thin Merino jersey or something with strategic mesh paneling. I noticed once you build up body heat in this jersey it doesn’t escape as easily as other materials allow. That said, the fabric is very thin so it resists heat buildup until temperatures get pretty high. It would still be a good option for sun protection on a hot summer ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tradeoff for the jersey’s OK breathability is excellent durability. I’ve worn this jersey tons of times, often with my camera pack or a hydration pack, and there is no visible wear and tear anywhere. The fabric isn’t pilling at all on the back, and the jersey hasn’t stretched out of shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dirt Craft Bike Shorts with Chamois: $199</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-front-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-front-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Patagonia Dirt Craft shorts, front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-front-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-front-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-front-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-front-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dirt Craft shorts are made from 82% recycled polyester, which offers durability and four-way stretch. A DWR finish provides resistance to splashes and moisture. At the waist is a zippered fly with a one-button closure, and this short comes with a chamois included.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-back-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-back-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Patagonia Dirt Craft shorts, back\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-back-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-back-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-back-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-back-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Men’s models are available in sizes 28-40, and come in six color options (including Utility Blue, as tested). Women’s models are also available, in sizes from 0-22. Ladies get four colors to choose from.   </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ride Impressions:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-SF-tower-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-SF-tower-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Patagonia Dirt Craft shorts, SF, rock slab\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-SF-tower-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-SF-tower-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-SF-tower-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-SF-tower-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-SF-tower-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-SF-tower-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing I liked about Patagonia’s Dirt Craft Bike Shorts was the waist adjustment system. Having a ‘just below 32’ waist, I typically cinch down the adjusters on all my riding shorts. With metal hooks and tons of loops to connect to, Patagonia’s design offers a huge range of adjustment that won’t slip or loosen up. You will get some fabric bunching at the sides if you cinch them down a lot, but in my case it wasn’t anything excessive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between two waist pockets and two zippered leg pockets the Dirt Craft shorts offer a good amount of storage. I noticed a bit of flopping from my phone when it was in the leg pocket, but not enough to become annoying.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-legs-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-legs-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Patagonia Dirt Craft shorts, on bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-legs-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-legs-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-legs-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-legs-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-legs-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-shorts-legs-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dirt Craft shorts offer a 12.5” inseam length. They reached right to my kneecaps, but they would ride up on my legs after some pedaling and leave an exposed gap above my kneepads. Pedalling mobility was great; the shorts’ fabric is stretchy too, but their cut is ergonomic enough on its own. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the other pieces, these shorts have proven to be highly durable. I have ridden and washed them tons of times, and they’re still in tip-top shape. That is particularly impressive since the fabric is very thin and lightweight. These shorts are definitely a good choice for a hot summer ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Chamois:</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-short-chamois-front.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-short-chamois-front.jpg\" alt=\"Patagonia Dirt Craft shots chamois, front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-short-chamois-front.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-short-chamois-front-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-short-chamois-front-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-short-chamois-front-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was very happy with Patagonia’s chamois, which I’d now call my second favorite (only losing to 7mesh’s MK3). This chamois is only available with the Dirt Craft shorts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wore a size 32, and although my waist is more like a 31 they are snug on me but not tight. The body section of the chamois is a bit tall for me, leaving the waistband sitting high up my belly. On warmer rides, I folded the waistband over itself for minimal coverage and it was perfectly comfortable. When temperatures dropped I left the waistband up, and the chamois were comfy either way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the legs were any longer on this chamois they would touch my knees, but thankfully the hems sit just high enough on my thighs. The legs and body aren’t tight enough to offer a compression fit on me, but the lower hems are wide and snug enough to stay in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-short-chamois-padding.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-short-chamois-padding.jpg\" alt=\"Patagonia Dirt Craft shorts chamois, padding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-short-chamois-padding.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-short-chamois-padding-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-short-chamois-padding-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-short-chamois-padding-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The chamois padding is a medium thickness, offering a good amount of saddle cushioning without feeling too thick. I found the padding sits in the right place, and it kept my butt very cozy throughout all my test rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super thin mesh panels on the sides keep these chamois as cool as possible, so they’re a good choice for all temperatures. With great saddle padding, zero comfort issues, and no wear and tear to report, I’ll be gladly wearing these chamois until I’ve worn them out!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.patagonia.com/home/\">patagonia.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/patagonia-dirt-craft-jersey-shorts-review/\">Patagonia’s Dirt Craft Jersey and Shorts Offer Great Durability From Lightweight Fabrics</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"d01e1d0ee4e52dd13868c301adc8fe8930b8beebd9fa8f599925161c9477fdaf","category":"Cycling"}
