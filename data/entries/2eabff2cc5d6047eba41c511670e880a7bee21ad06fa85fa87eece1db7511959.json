Notably, this means Windows 11 technically supports iMessage, although there are several limitations, including a lack of support for group chats, photos, videos, and conversation history beyond the current chat session.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll messages appear as gray bubbles in the Phone Link app, meaning iMessages and SMS text messages cannot be differentiated on a PC. In addition, messages are only delivered to a PC while the iPhone is connected via Bluetooth. Microsoft says the iPhone must be running iOS 14 or later, and this feature is not available for the iPad or Mac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll in all, this is a rather clunky workaround to Apple's lack of true iMessage support on Windows, but it's better than nothing for iPhone users with a PC.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/imessage/\">iMessage</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/windows/\">Windows</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/15/microsoft-completes-imessage-phone-link-rollout/\">Microsoft Completes Rollout of Basic iMessage Support on Windows 11</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-completes-rollout-of-basic-imessage-support-on-windows-11.2389605/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2eabff2cc5d6047eba41c511670e880a7bee21ad06fa85fa87eece1db7511959","category":"Apple"}
