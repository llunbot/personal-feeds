Apple addressed the out-of-bounds write issue with improved input validation. The WebKit vulnerability could allow maliciously crafted web content to execute code. Apple fixed this issue with improved memory management.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle's Threat Analysis Group and Amnesty International's Security Lab are credited with finding and reporting both issues to Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has also released a new Safari 16.4.1 update for macOS Monterey and macOS Big Sur, which likely addresses the WebKit vulnerability. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/\">iOS 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-16/\">iPadOS 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-13/\">macOS Ventura</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-16.238\">iOS 16</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-ventura.239\">macOS Ventura</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/07/ios-16-4-1-macos-13-3-1-vulnerability-fixes/\">iOS 16.4.1, iPadOS 16.4.1, and macOS 13.3.1 Fix Actively Exploited Vulnerabilities</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-16-4-1-ipados-16-4-1-and-macos-13-3-1-fix-actively-exploited-vulnerabilities.2386199/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"be6bf5e44f025510e7163eb066520fa3b9144ca7a7a551a186ebd12425b89679","category":"Apple"}
