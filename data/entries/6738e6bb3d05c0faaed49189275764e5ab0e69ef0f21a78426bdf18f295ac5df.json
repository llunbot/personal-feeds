He noted that PS5 and Xbox controllers are already supported by Vision Pro, but they aren't optimized for virtual reality experiences, lacking the six degrees of freedom (6DOF) needed for precise VR gaming controls.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWriting in his latest <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-02/apple-aapl-ai-and-ar-struggles-show-it-has-lost-some-of-its-product-edge\">\"Power On\" newsletter</a>, Gurman reaffirmed that the feature is still in development.
