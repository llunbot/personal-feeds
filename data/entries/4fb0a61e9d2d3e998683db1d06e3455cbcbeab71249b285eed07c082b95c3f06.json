{"title":"Apple 'Investigating' Macs With Cellular Connectivity","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apple-cellular-mac-custom-modem/","date":1733516201000,"content":"Apple is considering bringing cellular connectivity to the Mac lineup for the first time, reports <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-06/apple-s-modem-chips-pave-way-for-slimmer-iphone-cellular-macs-and-headsets\">Bloomberg</a></em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>. The Cupertino company is said to be \"investigating\" the possibility of adding a modem chip to a future Mac, but a cellular Mac isn't likely to launch until 2026 or later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/macbook-pro-purple-february.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nEarly in 2025, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apple-5g-modem-plans-report/\">plans to introduce</a> the custom-built 5G chip that it's had in the works for years now. The modem chip will be added to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a>, low-cost <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> \"Air,\" giving Apple an opportunity to test the technology before rolling it out to flagship devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFrom there, Apple's custom 5G modem chip will expand to other iPhones and iPads over a three-year period, and it may also come to the Mac. A Mac with a 5G chip would be able to connect to a cellular network just like a 5G-enabled <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or ‌iPad‌, and Wi-Fi or a cellular hotspot would not be required.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe first Apple modem chip will be limited to sub-6GHz 5G speeds, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apples-second-5g-modem-said-to-support-mmwave/\">the second-generation version</a> will support faster mmWave technology. Apple is aiming to outcompete Qualcomm with a third-generation model, offering better performance and AI features. Apple ultimately wants to phase out Qualcomm modem chips, replacing them with the modem chips that Apple has designed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast year, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/macbook-integrated-cellular-modem-2028/\">Gurman said</a> that Macs with Apple-designed modem chips would be introduced in 2028 at the earliest, with Apple planning to integrate 5G connectivity into its Apple silicon chips.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMacs with 5G connectivity have been rumored <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/02/apple-to-launch-macbooks-with-5g-2h-2020/\">for several years</a>, and <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/edwardbaig/2008-01-23-macbook-air-review_N.htm\">way back in 2008</a>, Apple considered adding a modem chip to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>. Then-CEO Steve Jobs said that Apple decided not to because the modem chip would take up too much room in the case and would lock customers to a specific carrier, but chip technology has come a long way since then. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-5g-modem/\">Apple 5G Modem</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apple-cellular-mac-custom-modem/\">Apple 'Investigating' Macs With Cellular Connectivity</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-investigating-macs-with-cellular-connectivity.2444794/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4fb0a61e9d2d3e998683db1d06e3455cbcbeab71249b285eed07c082b95c3f06","category":"Apple"}
