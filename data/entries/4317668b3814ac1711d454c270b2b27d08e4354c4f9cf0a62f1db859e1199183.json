It’s quite the billing to have, and for any cyclist it’s hard to ignore the challenge of ticking off the much-heralded ‘toughest climb of the Giro d’Italia’, which is why I find myself in the town of Ovaro in Italy’s northeast, layering up under overcast skies and scanning the hillsides for any clues about what is to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In preparation, I dug deep on the internet for testimonials from fellow cyclists. I wish I hadn’t. What I encountered were tales of pain and hardship that would rival a Dickens novel, backed up by statistics telling of sustained average gradients of over 12% for more than 10km, with some sections spiking above 20%. The Zoncolan’s numbers are alien to the average cafe ride or Sunday spin, and as we set off I can’t help but feel there are some occasions when it’s better to live in ignorance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The gates of hell</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the flow of the Degano River, Scott – my ride companion for the day – and I warm up our legs with a brief roll into town, knowing well that there is very little preamble before hitting the test we’re almost too nervous to acknowledge. In fact, no sooner have we turned off the main road through town than we pass under a wooden arch stretching across the road like an archer’s bow to indicate that we are now at the start of the climb.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-02-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Big Ride Monte Zoncolan\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-02-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-02-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-02-768x513.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-02-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-02-1140x761.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-02-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-02-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-02-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-02.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>The Monte Zoncolan sits ominously to the west of Ovaro.</figcaption><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Despite its folkloric status in the sport, the Zoncolan is a relatively recent discovery for the Giro d’Italia. The women’s race was first to tackle this Carnic Alp in 1997, with Italian Fabiana Luperini taking the stage win on her way to the overall title. Six years later the men tackled its slopes for the first time and Gilberto Simoni claimed the stage en route to the <em>maglia rosa</em> in 2003. On these initial runs, however, the organisers settled on the eastern approach from Sutrio before switching to the tougher western ascent from Ovaro in 2007 (also won by Simoni).</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-03-647x970.webp\" alt=\"Big Ride Monte Zoncolan\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-03-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-03-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-03-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-03-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-03-1366x2048.webp 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-03-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-03-1140x1709.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-03.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>The gradients around the Crocce della Ciclista are some of the toughest, peaking at 23%.</figcaption><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Since then, the Giro has alternated between the two routes for five further visits to the men’s and women’s races, most recently from Sutrio in 2021 when Lorenzo Fortunato held on from the morning breakaway to take the win over the summit on his Giro debut. The last time the Giro raced up the Zoncolan from the Ovaro side was in 2018 when both the men’s and women’s events tackled the climb, with Chris Froome and Annemiek van Vleuten winning both the stage and the overall.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/monte-zoncolan-italy-cycling\">Big Ride: The secret road up Monte Zoncolan</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/carnic-alps-cycling\">Big Ride: Borderline crazy in the Carnic Alps</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/monte-zoncolan-cycling\">Classic climb: Monte Zoncolan, a savage Italian climb so steep it makes the pros look slow</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>When Froome arrived at the Zoncolan that day, he already had 175km of riding in his legs. For me the number is nearer 2.5km, but despite that – or perhaps because of it – the slopes are already starting to bite. The Beata Vergine del Carmine Church displays the steepness of the road by requiring sturdy concrete stilts to stop it tumbling down the hillside.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-04-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Big Ride Monte Zoncolan\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-04-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-04-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-04-768x513.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-04-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-04-1140x761.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-04-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-04-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-04-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-04.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Just a kilometre up the road lies the village of Liariis, where the locals have been known to cheekily drape a banner above the road emblazoned with the words ‘La Porta per l’Inferno’, or ‘the gates of hell’ to you and I. Over breakfast I was warned that the fountain in Liariis is where the real climbing begins, so when I see it slip by I know what to expect and I’m not thrilled at the prospect.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Clicking into a smaller gear, I’m greeted by the first rider in the Zoncolan’s hall of fame on a sign to my left: Ottavio Bottecchia, the first Italian to win the Tour de France. In his day the Giro didn’t dare come up here. At approximately every half-kilometre into the climb, a signpost presents another picture of a Giro hero to spur you on or mock your efforts, depending on your point of view. Bottecchia is followed by the likes of Alfredo Binda, Louison Bobet and Charly Gaul. Further up you’ll find Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Miguel Induráin and, of course, Marco Pantani.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-05-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Big Ride Monte Zoncolan\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-05-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-05-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-05-768x513.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-05-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-05-1140x761.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-05-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-05-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-05-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-05.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Not even this photo quite does it justice.

To mark the occasion, the Crocce della Ciclista, a crucifix sculpted from bike forks and a handlebar, pokes out from the roadside in sparkling form. There’s a penance to be paid if you stop to read the plaque below, however. At 22% gradient it’ll take more than a couple of Hail Marys to get your feet clipped in again.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-06-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Big Ride Monte Zoncolan\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-06-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-06-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-06-768x513.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-06-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-06-1140x761.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-06-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-06-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-06-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-06.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>The Zoncolan debuted at the men’s Giro d’Italia in 2003, the same year Marco Pantani rode his final <em>Corsa Rosa</em>.</figcaption><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>The daily grind</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For much of the climb the road is enclosed by woodland, making it hard to get any sense of progress.

Or that might just be the sweat in my eyes.

We pass through a series of dark tunnels where the sound of trickling water reverberates, and when we emerge into the sunlight we can see the four remaining hairpins stacked almost on top of one another to our right.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-08-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Big Ride Monte Zoncolan\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-08-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-08-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-08-768x513.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-08-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-08-1140x761.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-08-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-08-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-08-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-08.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>On race day these slopes are packed with fans trying to keep their balance.</figcaption><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In short succession we pass by Gino Bartali, Fausto Coppi and Gilberto Simoni.

This isn’t the work of any old village delinquents, but rather Slovenian fans who etched the names of Domen Novak and Tadej Pogačar to mark the Giro’s arrival last May. One supporter even spray-painted ‘Pogi’ over a traffic mirror. Naughty, naughty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From here, the incline persists to the base of the second major obstacle of the day, Monte Crostis. It’s a climb less familiar to the likes of Pogačar, having never been included in the Giro, though not for want of trying. It was due to be included in 2011 but was ruled out the night before its scheduled inclusion due to safety concerns.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-11-647x970.webp\" alt=\"Big Ride Monte Zoncolan\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-11-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-11-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-11-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-11-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-11-1366x2048.webp 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-11-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-11-1140x1709.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-11.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>The less-trodden descent into Priola has an average gradient of -13.5%.</figcaption><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As it is, we’re tackling it in reverse, opting for the southeastern ascent from Ravascletto.

As we break through the tree line, a glance to the right sees the road cut into the forested slopes below, tying up the obscured view like a ribbon. Now at 1,600m altitude we are well and truly in the clouds, with mist reducing visibility to barely 20 metres in front of us. Views into the valley are now a thing of the past, and then the road changes surface without warning.

I’m assured that the vistas would be unbeatable atop this panoramic road if it weren’t for the low-lying cloud, but I’m unbothered. The surprises that reveal themselves through each misty bend keep me on my ever-cooling toes. A shrine, puddle, waterfall or dip in the road – it all feels so surreal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After around 6km on the <em>sterrato</em>, the surface returns to asphalt in time for a momentary 10% kicker to the summit of Monte Crostis, its sticker-coated sign standing ominously in the fog.

The 9% average Sutrio route was used for the Zoncolan’s Giro christening in 1997 for the women’s race, on a stage won by Italian Fabiana Luperini. The men first sampled the Sutrio side in 2003, when eventual Giro champion Gilberto Simoni took stage honours. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The headline-grabbing Ovaro side, with its average gradient of 12.3%, debuted in 2005, with Simoni again taking stage glory. Since then, the Ovaro side has garnered the title of the most vicious climb that Italy – and perhaps Europe – can offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent history, Michael Rogers beat Francesco Manuel Bongiorno on the Zoncolan in 2014 after the latter was forced to unclip on the 20% slopes due to fan encroachment. Later, Chris Froome claimed his first Giro stage on the Zoncolan in 2018, beginning a surprise turnaround in the GC.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"954\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-15-970x954.webp\" alt=\"Big Ride Monte Zoncolan\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-15-970x954.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-15-300x295.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-15-768x755.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-15-75x75.webp 75w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-15-750x737.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-15-1140x1121.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/big-ride-165-monte-zoncolan-15.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Tualis’s town square is named in honour of Italy’s Grand Tour.</figcaption><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>How we did it</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Travel </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Direct flights to Venice-Marco Polo Airport are regularly scheduled from London, Birmingham, Manchester, Edinburgh and Bristol.
