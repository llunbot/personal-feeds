The change is necessitated by the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which seeks to reign in the apparent anticompetitive conduct of big tech companies.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple reportedly plans to comply with EU law in a way that retains close control over the apps downloaded outside the ‌App Store‌. Apple has not yet revealed its final plans to comply with this aspect of the DMA, but the <em>WSJ</em> today provided new details citing people familiar with the company's plans. Specifically, Apple will apparently retain the ability to review each app offered outside the app store, as well as take a fee from developers that offer them. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nExact details of the fee structure are unknown, but Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/04/apple-reveals-dutch-in-app-payment-commission/\">charges a 27% commission</a> on in-app purchases made through alternative payment systems in the Netherlands, a capability that was initially triggered by a Dutch regulatory ruling. This is just three percent lower than its default fee, but unlike Apple's commission, it does not include tax, making the net total more than Apple's fee for most developers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has reportedly been working on the plan for offering sideloading for over a year and the company has held meetings with EU officials in recent months to discuss the new rules. The deadline to enact the changes is Thursday, March 7.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCompanies are already said to be lining up to take advantage of the impending changes. For example, Spotify is mulling offering its app via its website to skirt the ‌App Store‌, Microsoft has considered launching its own third-party app store specifically for games, and Meta is planning to launch a system to download apps directly from ads.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-wall-street-journal/\">The Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/24/sideloading-in-europe-app-review-and-fees/\">Report: Sideloading in Europe Will Still Involve App Review and Fees</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-sideloading-in-europe-will-still-involve-app-review-and-fees.2417299/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"35949586115b7ea7eab6a3eb7de669478d3bb31765e0d078768ad02ba25d1d5c","category":"Apple"}
