It’s become more popular lately in the UK, getting bigger and lasting longer each year</p>\n<p>Further down this page, we’ll also delve into Cyber Monday and how it’s different from Black Friday.</p>\n<h2>When will Black Friday 2021 cycling deals be released?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> We expect to see 2021 Black Friday cycling deals on road and mountain bikes, components, accessories, and more.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Black Friday 2021 takes place on 26 November, but it no longer lasts for a single day. Rather, the discounting continues for at least a fortnight. In recent years, some retailers even unveiled early-bird ‘pre-Black Friday’ sales in mid-November, as seen above.</p>\n<p>We’re sure we’ll see some hot cycling deals released before the big day. The question is: will they better Black Friday itself? It’s hard to say.</p>\n<p>As many studies have now shown, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/nov/21/black-friday-brush-up-on-prices-as-that-deal-might-not-be-a-bargain\" target=\"_blank\">Black Friday Deals aren’t always as spectacular as they might appear to be</a>. Historic price comparison tools such as <a href=\"https://camelcamelcamel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CamelCamelCamel</a> are well worth using to ensure you aren’t getting caught up in the hype.</p>\n<p>That said, there are usually a few gems tucked away in the dusty corners of each retailer’s site, and you can rely on BikeRadar to do the digging and find these for you.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h2>How to get a good deal on Black Friday 2021</h2>\n<ul><li>A little research goes a long way. Read a few online reviews before you commit to buy. There may be a reason for that 40 per cent discount</li>\n<li>Have you actually thought about what you want to buy? We recommend you put together a wishlist in advance so you don’t come to regret a rash decision</li>\n<li>Take price drops with a pinch of salt: they can often be hugely exaggerated, since they’re listed against an RRP that might be years old. Luckily, we track deal prices and do our best to let you know about a product’s price history so you know you’re definitely getting the best deal</li>\n<li>Don’t let the stress get to you! If you see a deal that’s marked as ‘nearly out of stock’, add it to your shopping basket straight away. Then take a look at the prices that other retailers are advertising. You normally get at least a couple of minutes before the item leaves your basket.</li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>Should I wait for Cyber Monday?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cyber Monday isn’t really a big deal these days.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>What used to be the online-exclusive sequel to Black Friday, Cyber Monday is becoming obsolete. We make an ever greater proportion of purchases on the web than in brick-and-mortar shops. Retailers now seldom offer deals either just in-store or online.</p>\n<p>However, the absence of Covid restrictions in the UK this year (touch wood) will inevitably lead to more shop tills ringing than in last winter’s lockdown. Perhaps physical stores will keep back some deals for Cyber Monday.</p>\n<p>What does this mean for you?  Expect a hectic four-day period of sales from 26 to 29 November and, if you see a barnstorming bargain on Black Friday, we don’t advise hanging on for the price to drop on Cyber Monday.</p>","author":"Jack Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"e34e131cca72b42ae32dbf69cf70b5e03f7b2ffbe150c863ac5f566499d13d8a","category":"Cycling"}
