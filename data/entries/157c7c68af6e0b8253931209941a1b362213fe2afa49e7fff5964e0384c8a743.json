However, I quickly realized this allows MTB riders who don’t have in-frame storage to enjoy the same convenience without buying a whole new frame or bike. I also realized while testing the tools some of them were quite well suited to gravel/touring bikes along with MTBs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m impressed with how many functions Crankbrothers crammed into their compact multi-tools, and the quality of the tools, cages, and storage tubes is very good. I never had any functional failures with any part of the tools I tested. To see all the details of the whole S.O.S. Tools collection (including weights and all functions of each), check out my <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/crankbrothers-new-s-o-s-on-bike-tools/\">launch article</a> from earlier this year. Since a few of the tools are very simple, I focused on the more deluxe models for testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>BC18 Bottle Cage Tool Kit – $99.99</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-laid-out-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-laid-out-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Crankbrothers SOS Tools, BC18 pieces\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-laid-out-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-laid-out-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-laid-out-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-laid-out-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-laid-out-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-laid-out-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Right away this was my favorite of the S.O.S. tool series because it’s the only kit that carries tools and water on one bottle mount. Assuming you have room for a large enough bottle, this kit allows you to ditch your hydration pack and remain well-equipped with trailside tools.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-on-Knolly-2-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-on-Knolly-2-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Crankbrothers SOS Tools, BC18 on Knolly\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-on-Knolly-2-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-on-Knolly-2-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-on-Knolly-2-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-on-Knolly-2-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I ride medium frames and I had trouble finding a bike that was compatible with the BC18. I first installed it on my Knolly Chilcotin and it seemed to fit, but only with my smallest water bottle. Unfortunately, after two rides I realized my piggyback shock was contacting the bottle. With no room to slide the kit forward, I had to remove it from the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to note the BC18 kit requires more clearance than a standard bottle cage. Even with no spacers under it, the water bottle sits quite high off your frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-Devinci-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-Devinci-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Crankbrothers SOS Tools, BC18, Devinci E-Troy Lite\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-Devinci-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-Devinci-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-Devinci-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-Devinci-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-Devinci-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-Devinci-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I later installed it on the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/devinci-e-troy-lite-gx-axs-12s-review/\">Devinci E-Troy Lite</a> eMTB. With two spacers underneath to clear the eMTB’s wide top tube it fit… but once again, only with a small water bottle. I did a few rides with it but soon pulled it off. Since eMTBs tend to encourage longer rides, I wanted to carry more water than one small bottle’s worth on the E-Troy Lite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s an unlikely idea anyway, but FYI this tool will probably not fit on a bike with in-frame storage! I tried installing the BC18 on a Trek Slash and a Rocky Mountain Altitude, and both storage doors are too wide and flat. Even with two spacers, the tool kit will not clear the width of those frames. I guess if you were thinking about increasing your in/on-bike storage you’re out of luck.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-Knolly-dirty-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-Knolly-dirty-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Crankbrothers SOS Tools, BC18, Knolly, dirty\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-Knolly-dirty-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-Knolly-dirty-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-Knolly-dirty-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-Knolly-dirty-768x1024.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-BC18-Knolly-dirty-1152x1536.webp 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One good thing about the BC18 tool kit is that the storage tube keeps the multi-tool clean and dry through muddy rides. I even submerged the tube in water for 15 minutes, and it stayed perfectly dry inside. I also like the fact that this kit can carry a larger 25g Co2 canister.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>TS18 Tube Stash Tool Kit: $89.99</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-TS18-BC2-Kona-Sutra-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-TS18-BC2-Kona-Sutra-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Crankbrothers SOS Tools, TS18 and BC2 on Kona\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-TS18-BC2-Kona-Sutra-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-TS18-BC2-Kona-Sutra-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-TS18-BC2-Kona-Sutra-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-TS18-BC2-Kona-Sutra-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-TS18-BC2-Kona-Sutra-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-TS18-BC2-Kona-Sutra-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While Crankbrothers is primarily marketing the S.O.S. tools to mountain bikers, I installed the TS18 on a Kona Sutra touring bike (which runs tubed tires), along with the BC2 Bottle Cage. This combo covers all the essentials; The BC2 Bottle Cage takes care of water (a big bottle fits easily on this bike), and the Tube Stash Tool Kit provides a multi-tool, Co2 canister and spare tube. With both tools, I have two tire levers to work with.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-TS18-pieces-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-TS18-pieces-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Crankbrothers S.O.S.

If your bike only has one mount, you’re still stuck with a pack to carry water.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>TT17 Twin Tube Tool Kit: $119.99</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-Twin-Tube-Tool-Kit-Knolly-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-Twin-Tube-Tool-Kit-Knolly-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Crankbrothers SOS Tools, TT17 on Knolly\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-Twin-Tube-Tool-Kit-Knolly-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-Twin-Tube-Tool-Kit-Knolly-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-Twin-Tube-Tool-Kit-Knolly-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-Twin-Tube-Tool-Kit-Knolly-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-Twin-Tube-Tool-Kit-Knolly-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-Twin-Tube-Tool-Kit-Knolly-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months ago, I put the Twin Tube Tool Kit on my Knolly. While it is slightly wider than my frame, the Twin Tube kit is not wide enough to cause any issues with pedaling. This tool should fit on any bike with a water bottle mount. Its three mounting slots offer plenty of fore-aft adjustment, and the tool is smaller than any bottle cage/bottle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming you’re looking to ride pack-free, this kit is ideal for a bike that can carry a water bottle and another accessory. It’s not a great option if you’re already committed to wearing a pack, as you can easily stash a far lighter, more compact multi-tool than the 257g Twin Tube Tool Kit. The Twin Tube kit does make its tools quick and easy to access during a trailside stop.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-skittles-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-skittles-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Crankbrothers SOS Tools, skittles!\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-skittles-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-skittles-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-skittles-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-skittles-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-skittles-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-skittles-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I recently found out I’m diabetic, and I now need to bring sugary snacks on rides so I tried carrying some Skittles in the TT17’s storage tube. It held enough to keep me going for a shorter ride… at least a big mouthful! If you put hard candies in the tube (or similar items), be aware they will rattle loudly as you ride!  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later I put a Co2 cartridge in the storage tube, and the top cap (which threads onto the cylinder) held it tightly without rattling. The spring-loaded multi-tool in the other tube never made any noise while I rode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for weather resistance, the Twin Tube tool easily fought off mud splatters and short bursts of light rain. Some water got into the mounting bracket in these conditions, but not into the storage tubes.  Later I went for an hour-long ride in steady rain (see title photo). The multi-tool stayed perfectly dry, but a small amount of water did get into the side with the Co2 canister. It might be wise to check the multi-tool and Co2/storage tube after a very wet ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Tools:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-multi-tool-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-multi-tool-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Crankbrothers SOS Tools, T-handle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-multi-tool-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-multi-tool-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-multi-tool-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-multi-tool-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I did use the S.O.S. multi-tools several times and they’re good quality tools that offer all the essentials. The multi-tool is small, but you can leave the inflator head/chain tool clipped to it, or even use the storage tube for extra leverage if needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-tire-levers-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-tire-levers-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Crankbrothers SOS Tools, tire levers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-tire-levers-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-tire-levers-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-tire-levers-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-tire-levers-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-tire-levers-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crankbrothers-SOS-tools-tire-levers-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I never had to plug a tire with the S.O.S. tools plug tool, but I did use the levers to swap a set of tires on my MTB. The only thing the levers lack is a hooked notch to hold themselves on a spoke. Aside from that, I had no issues working with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.crankbrothers.com/collections/sos\">crankbrothers.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/crankbrothers-s-o-s-tools-on-bike-storage/\">Crankbrothers’ S.O.S.
