Thanks to improved formulas, they are less likely to cause stomach trouble, provided you use them properly.</p>\n<p>Despite their elite connotations, energy drinks aren’t just for professional athletes. Sports nutrition experts recommend amateurs use them pretty much every day to ensure adequate carb intake.</p>\n<p>With so many energy drinks on the market, it’s hard to choose the right one(s) for you: all contain carbohydrates, but in differing quantities and ratios, while some contain electrolytes and others don’t.</p>\n<p>To help narrow down your choice, we’ve tested dozens of cycling energy drinks by guzzling bidon after bidon on all manner of rides.</p>\n<p>We’ve picked our favourites based on factors including carbohydrate content and ratio, price per serving and taste.</p>\n<p>For more advice on how to choose an energy drink for cycling, head to our buyer’s guide at the bottom of the article.</p>\n<p>Andy Blow, sports scientist and co-founder of Precision Fuel and Hydration, and Dr Tim Podlogar, nutritionist for Bora-Hansgrohe WorldTour team, have helped us answer some common questions surrounding energy drinks.</p>\n<h2>The best energy drinks for cycling, as rated by BikeRadar testers</h2>\n<h3>SiS Beta Fuel 80</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"SiS Beta Fuel 80 sachet\" title=\"11-36-57BikeRadarJULY_180723ss8477\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Beta Fuel 80 is an energy drink alpha.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Carbohydrates per serving</strong>: 80g</li>\n<li><strong>Carbohydrate ratio</strong>: 1:0.8 maltodextrin to fructose</li>\n<li><strong>Electrolytes</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Price per serving</strong>: £2.75/€3 per sachet</li>\n<li><strong>Flavours</strong>: Orange, strawberry and lime</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SiS Beta Fuel 80 is the cycling rocket fuel that powered Chris Froome’s 80km-solo stage victory in the 2018 Giro d’Italia, according to the brand.</p>\n<p>But it’s not just for elite athletes – Beta Fuel’s 80g carbohydrates per serving can help you hit a very high hourly carb intake while riding all-out, or when riding slower in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/ultra-distance-cycling/\">ultra-endurance events</a>.</p>\n<p>Citing scientific evidence, SiS says Beta Fuel’s 1:0.8 maltodextrin to fructose ratio helps you absorb the carbohydrates without experiencing GI upset.</p>\n<p>Consuming up to two sachets of Beta Fuel 80 over the course of long <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/what-is-gravel-riding/\">gravel rides</a> caused me no issues. In the orange flavour I tested, Beta Fuel was by far the best-tasting high-carb energy drink too.</p>\n<p>The relatively high price per serving and gram of carbohydrate reflects that Beta Fuel 80 isn’t an everyday energy drink. Where performance really counts, in hard training sessions and events, it could be worth it.</p>\n<p>The Beta Fuel 80 comes in sachets, which are easy to travel with and carry on the bike. But this could lead to more packaging waste than tubs or pouches.</p>\n<p>Beta Fuel 80 is suitable for vegans and tested for banned substances, according to SiS.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Styrkr Mix90 Energy Drink Mix</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Styrkr Mix90 Energy Drink Mix\" title=\"Bikeradarstyrkrenergyfdrinkpowder\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Mix90 Energy Drink Mix is good value for its carb content.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Carbohydrates per serving</strong>: 90g</li>\n<li><strong>Carbohydrate ratio</strong>: 1:0.8 maltodextrin to fructose</li>\n<li><strong>Electrolytes</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Price per serving</strong>: £2.50</li>\n<li><strong>Flavours</strong>: Neutral</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Styrkr Mix90 Energy Drink Mix is one of the punchiest around but tastes okay and sits well on the stomach.</p>\n<p>Only top-level endurance athletes will benefit from and be able to absorb in an hour the 90g carbohydrates a serving contains.</p>\n<p>But sipping the Mix90 Energy Drink Mix little and often worked well for me on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/audax/\">audaxes</a>. Two sachets spaced over several hours, together with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-energy-bars/\">energy bars </a>and solid food, enabled me to ingest more than 60g of carbohydrates an hour.</p>\n<p>Dissolved in 500ml of water, as Styrkr recommends, the Mix90 Energy Drink Mix is a little thick. It’s unflavoured but not that sweet for a high-carb mix.</p>\n<p>This meant drinking a whole bottle over 1.5 hours while pushing along didn’t feel uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>Styrkr says the Mix90 Energy Drink Mix contains electrolytes in the form of sodium chloride to replace salt lost in sweat. The brand claims added L-glutamine reduces blood ammonia build-up, a contributing factor to fatigue during exercise.</p>\n<p>The price per serving compares well to high-carb rivals – Mix90 Energy Drink Mix delivers 10g more carbs than Beta Fuel for 25p less.</p>\n<p>The Mix90 Energy Drink Mix is vegan, gluten-free and made from natural ingredients, according to Styrkr.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>High5 Energy Drink</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"High5 energy drink\" title=\"12-09-44BikeRadar_150823_kg0095\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> High5’s energy drink is a good-value, versatile option.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Carbohydrates per serving</strong>: 44g</li>\n<li><strong>Carbohydrate ratio</strong>: 2:1 maltodextrin to fructose</li>\n<li><strong>Electrolytes</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Price per serving</strong>: £0.90 (1kg tub)</li>\n<li><strong>Flavours</strong>: Berry, citrus, orange, tropical</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The High5 Energy Drink provides a good amount of energy and some electrolytes at a reasonable price.</p>\n<p>Despite the low cost, the High5 Energy Drink contains 44g of carbohydrates per serving in a 2:1 maltodextrin to fructose ratio.

Once the hypertonic drink is inside your gut, your body removes water from your blood to maintain the correct concentration of liquid in your intestine. </p>\n<p>Therefore, hypertonic drinks are better at meeting high-energy demands than hydrating you.</p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section>\n\n<p>This isotonic formula has a similar concentration to your blood, which aids absorption.</p>\n<p>Stronger carbohydrate drinks, which contain more than 80g carbohydrates per serving, are hypertonic.</p>\n<p>Blow says: “This makes them good for delivering energy and less good for hydration.</p>\n<p>Their carbohydrate content slows their passage through your gut and, in turn, their rate of absorption.</p>\n<h3>Why should I use carbohydrate energy drinks?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"EBNAT-KAPPEL, SWITZERLAND - JUNE 19: Clara Koppenburg of Germany and Team Cofidis picks bottles at the feed zone during the 3rd Tour de Suisse Women 2023, Stage 3 a 120.8km stage from St. Gallen to Ebnat-Kappel / #UCIWWT / on June 19, 2023 in Ebnat-Kappel, Switzerland.

So you could aim to drink one bottle an hour of a more carb-concentrated drink, such as Beta Fuel.</p>\n<h4>Sugar sources</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Back of Torq energy drink\" title=\"11-32-13BikeRadarJULY_180723ss8461\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The energy drink ingredients should list at least two types of sugars.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers </i></span></div>\n<p>The best energy drinks will contain multiple types of sugar.</p>\n<p>“With only one type of carbohydrate, such as glucose, or dextrose or maltodextrin, you can only absorb 60g carbohydrates per hour, whereas as soon as you add fructose, you can go higher,” explains Dr Podlogar.</p>\n<p>Blow says maltodextrin is commonly used in sports drinks because it’s not too sweet but is carb-dense.</p>\n<p>It breaks down into glucose, hence the need for another type of sugar, such as fructose.</p>\n<h4>Taste</h4>\n<p>Cycling energy drinks come in a range of flavours, with many of the stronger variants being unflavoured.
