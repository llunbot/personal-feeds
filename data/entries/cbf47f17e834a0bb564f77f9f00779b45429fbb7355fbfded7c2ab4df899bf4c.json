Yet it’s also true that part of its fame – and that of other storied climbs in its vicinity such as the Aspin, Peyresourde and Aubisque – comes from the simple fact that there aren’t actually that many ways to create a full loop or a point-to-point in the Pyrenees without including at least one of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-2-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclist Magazine issue 154 Summer 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Rob Milton</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, it’s no surprise that our Pyrenean Big Ride in the Summer 2024 issue of <em>Cyclist</em> takes in the Tourmalet, but before it gets there it tackles a climb that you might not even have heard of. The Col de Beyrède doesn’t rise to quite the same altitude, but the gradient is steeper, the road is quieter and the summit is marked by little more than a sign at the side of the road and the indifferent company of a few donkeys and cows.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-3-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclist Magazine issue 154 Summer 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-3-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Rob Milton</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2024 Tour de France peloton will climb the Col du Tourmalet – though not the Col de Beyrède, sadly – on Stage 14, and we’d put good money on Ineos Grenadiers’ Geraint Thomas being sat towards the front of the group of favourites when they get there. Thomas is one of pro cycling’s elder statesmen these days, but as he tells us in our in-depth profile this issue, he’s still as ambitious as ever, 17 years on from his Tour debut.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-4-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclist Magazine issue 154 Summer 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-4-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/issue-154-promo-4.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Rob Milton</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas showed his enduring class by finishing third at the 2024 Giro d’Italia, and this issue we look back at <em>La Corsa Rosa</em> through the lens of pro photographer Chris Auld, as he goes behind the scenes on the daily challenges and rewards of keeping up with the relentless pace of a Grand Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also in the Summer 2024 issue, we talk to four of the brave souls who took on the unique 2,400km TransAtlantic Way along Ireland’s west coast, chart the rich history of the iconic Specialized Tarmac, speak to British national time-trial champion Josh Tarling and test out new bikes from Cervélo, Officine Mattio and 3T, plus SRAM’s updated Red AXS groupset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.cyclist.co.uk/collections/coffee/products/issue-154\" target=\"_blank\">Get your issue at the Cyclist Shop</a> or <a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe</a> and get every issue delivered free, straight to your door.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/clickable-subs-promo7-970x343.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/clickable-subs-promo7-970x343.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/clickable-subs-promo7-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/clickable-subs-promo7-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/clickable-subs-promo7-1536x543.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/clickable-subs-promo7-2048x724.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/clickable-subs-promo7-750x265.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/clickable-subs-promo7-1140x403.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There are three levels of <em>Cyclist </em>subscriptions available.
