Their mission was supposed to last eight days, but there was some expectation that they might stay a little longer. However, no one envisioned the crew remaining this long. That changed when, during Starliner's flight to the space station, five of the 28 small thrusters that guide Starliner failed. After some touch-and-go operations, the astronauts and flight controllers at Johnson Space Center coaxed the spacecraft to a safe docking at the station.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044954#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044954&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"620b31b3bf72fe4539295703ed1e59fdc12d65cdb40a2ad5978fe0b099566628","category":"Tech"}
