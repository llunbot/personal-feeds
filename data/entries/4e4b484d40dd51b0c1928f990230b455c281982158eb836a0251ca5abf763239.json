To do that, there’s a complete wrap around on the bottom half of the shoe, but with a tough Cordura mesh upper half.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new versions add a heel cup to reduced heel slippage, and they’re a lot lighter, too. They also updated the looks, moving away from a skate shoe aesthetic to something decidedly more mountain bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-4.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-4.webp\" alt=\"ride concepts hellion elite boa mountain bike shoes shown from front.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-4.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-4-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-4-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-4-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-4-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-4-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-4-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Enduro riders prioritize protection and stiffness over breathability and comfort. Trail riders wanted the opposite, willing to give up a bit of protection for a lighter, cooler shoe.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-5.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-5.webp\" alt=\"ride concepts hellion elite boa mountain bike shoes shown from rear.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-5.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-5-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-5-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-5-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-5-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-5-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-5-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, RC created a new footbed and outsole (aka “chassis”) that could work for both.

They tested Kevlar, but the Cordura they chose actually had better puncture resistance and breathability, and it comes in different colors. They say most Cordura comes with a membrane backing, but they removed that to improve breathability with only a tiny decrease in toughness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>EVA midsole for vibration damping, tuned to provide comfort without giving up pedal feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, though, the models split off with different features tailored to the intended user.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hellion – “The Shred-Ready Pedaler”</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-lace-2025-3.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-lace-2025-3.webp\" alt=\"ride concepts hellion lace-up mountain bike shoes shown from top front.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-lace-2025-3.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-lace-2025-3-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-lace-2025-3-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-lace-2025-3-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-lace-2025-3-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>The lace-up “flat pedal” version does without the Velcro power strap.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The standard Hellion gets two options – Laces ($160 flats / $180 clip-in) or BOA ($190 flats / $210 clip-in). The laces model has a stretchy band to tuck them into, and (for the clip-in model) a new, lighter Velcro “power strap” switched from microfiber to ripstop nylon, which is tougher, lighter, and dries faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-lace-2025-2.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-lace-2025-2.webp\" alt=\"person walking in ride concepts hellion boa mountain bike shoes.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-lace-2025-2.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-lace-2025-2-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-lace-2025-2-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-lace-2025-2-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-lace-2025-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-lace-2025-2-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-lace-2025-2-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The BOA version gets a single Li2 dial with a new over-wrap design to cradle your foot without creating hot spots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the Elite below, it has smaller, softer TPU toe cap to maximize ventilation through the mesh upper. A fully gusseted tongue keeps scree out…and helps keep it centered over your foot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clipless models get a longer 40mm cleat channel for more adjustment range, plus a nylon shank throughout to improve stiffness for more efficient pedaling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hellion Elite BOA – “The Unrelenting Descender”</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-7.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-7.webp\" alt=\"ride concepts hellion elite boa mountain bike shoes shown from top front.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-7.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-7-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-7-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-7-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-boa-2025-7-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If gravity’s your game, the new Hellion Elite ($230 flats / $250 clip-in) upgrades to dual BOA dials with a multi-piece top wrap for even pressure distribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The toe cap is larger, with a tougher KPU material, and they added a “rampart” KPU shielding around the bottom of the BOA dials to protect them from rock strikes. BTW, KPU is an in-molded 3D process that allows them to add thickness and shaping, without adding more seams and parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Elite also adds D3O padding to the overwrap. All three models have D3O insoles for solid impact and vibration reduction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Available now in men’s and women’s versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://rideconcepts.com/collections/hellion\" target=\"_blank\">RideConcepts.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ride-concepts-hellion-elite-mountain-bike-shoes-2025/\">Ride Concepts Hellion MTB Shoes Get More Mountain Bike-y</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Staff","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"4e4b484d40dd51b0c1928f990230b455c281982158eb836a0251ca5abf763239","category":"Cycling"}
