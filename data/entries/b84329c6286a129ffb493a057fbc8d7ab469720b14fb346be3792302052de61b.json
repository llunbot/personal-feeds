We are also tracking any problems, the latest updates, and what’s new in the beta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new version of macOS is called Sequoia, named after the Californian National Park and, more specifically, the world’s largest trees. Among the new features coming to Macs in Sequoia are iPhone mirroring, which puts your iPhone screen on your Mac’s display and lets you interact with it via your mouse and keyboard, a new Video conferencing presenter preview, and changes to Safari. In addition, developers will be easily able to port games between iPhone, Mac, and iPad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The free software update brings a raft of interface tweaks, bug fixes, and new features. In this article, we discuss everything you need to know about macOS 15 Sequoia including how to download it. We also link to various tutorials about how to use the new features. Some features will only work on Macs with an M-series chip, including several Apple Intelligence features that will offer help with writing, creating images, editing photos, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people have been running Sequoia for some time thanks to Apple’s beta testing program. In this article, we also discuss the latest versions of both the developer and public beta as Apple continues work on the development of the operating system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Update December 16<em>:</em></strong><em> macOS Sequoia 15.3 beta 1 is now available to developers. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sequoia: Latest version </h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>macOS 15.2 – December 11</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple released <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/12/apple-intelligence-now-features-image-playground-genmoji-and-more/\">macOS 15.2</a> on December 11. It has a slew of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a> updates, including Genmoji, Image Playground, ChatGPT integration, advanced Writing Tools, and more. Additionally, there are a few tweaks and bug fixes, and various performance improvements and securty updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2525746/when-is-the-best-time-to-buy-an-ipad.html\">macOS 15.1.1</a> arrived in early December as an ’emergency update’ necessary to patch flaws in JavaScript and WebKit that Apple says “may have been actively exploited on Intel-based Mac systems.” There is no release for Macs running <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1670742/macos-14-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">macOS Sonoma 14.7.1</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678251/macos-13-ventura-features-compatibility-download-install.html\">Ventura 13.7.1</a>, yet, but that update is likely to come soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>macOS 15.1 arrived on October 28. This major update brings the first raft of Apple Intelligence features to Macs with the M-series chip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>macOS 15.0.1 was released on October 3, 2024. It did not contain new features, but it did include two important bug fixes. One bug fix corrected the error that led Messages to quit when replying to a message that shared an Apple Watch face. The other fix was for compatibility with third-party security software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple released macOS Sequoia to the public earlier than usual, alongside iOS 18 on Monday, September 16. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-latest-version-release-problems-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362011/watchos-11-watch-faces-fitness-vitals-translate.html\">watchOS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2377675/ipados-18-superguide-features-release.html\">iPadOS 18</a> were released at the same time. The next major update to Sequoia will be macOS 15.1 which is expected by the end of the month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For information about what is coming in the next version look at the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html#toc-5\">latest version of the Sequoia beta</a> section below. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s new in macOS Sequoia 15.2</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Release date: December 11, 2024</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>On October 23, Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15.2 beta 1 to developers.

After Apple introduced its M-series Macs, the company said it would continue to support Intel Macs for several years, but it did not offer specifics. The clock is ticking on Intel Macs, but the last generation of Intel Macs remains on the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673697/what-version-of-macos-can-my-mac-run.html\">macOS 15 compatibility list</a> with a few <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2366862/macos-sequoia-intel-mac-compatibility-feature-iphone-mirroring.html\">Intel Macs that can run macOS Sequoia</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, only Macs with an M1, M2, or M3-series chip will support the new AI features referred to as “Apple Intelligence.” That includes the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iMac from 2021 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac Pro from 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac Studio from 2022 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MacBook Air from late 2020 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac mini from late 2020 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MacBook Pro from late 2020 and later </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Mac can’t be updated to Sequoia that doesn’t mean you are completely abandoned by Apple. Apple will provide security updates for some Macs that don’t run macOS 15. Generally, Apple provides software updates for the past two versions of macOS. See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673939/this-is-how-long-macs-and-macbooks-last.html\">How long does Apple support Macs</a>? On average, Macs get <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1997296/intel-mac-support-compatibility-apple-silicon.html\">6.6 years of macOS updates</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out which version of macOS and older Mac can run take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673697/what-version-of-macos-can-my-mac-run.html\">macOS compatibility list</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sequoia: Should I install Sequoia?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As long as your Mac can run it, we recommend updating to Sequoia. The new features–all of which we discuss below–look enticing enough. We address how <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2379434/macos-sequoia-vs-sonoma-difference.html\">macOS Sequoia compares to Sonoma</a>? in a separate article. We also run through <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2456442/6-reasons-why-you-need-to-upgrade-to-macos-sequoia.html\">6 reasons why you need to upgrade to macOS Sequoia</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it’s wise to wait a week or so for the inevitable issues with the early release to be addressed: despite the beta program, there are often issues once the software update gets out into the wide Mac world. It’s also wise to wait because the download will likely take a lot longer if you try soon after it becomes available. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Refer to the problems and bugs section above to see if any of the identified issues might affect you. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sequoia: How to install</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Installing macOS Sequoia is a breeze. Open System Settings and go to <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Software Update</em>; macOS will check for any available updates and guide you through the process of installing them. You simply have to follow the instructions, which we explain in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671172/how-to-update-macos.html\">macOS updating guide</a>. And it’s easier still if you’ve turned on Automatic Updates, which you can do from the same screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you do encounter problems the following may be useful:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671172/how-to-update-macos.html\">How to install macOS Sequoia on your Mac</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/677467/how-to-get-mac-ready-new-macos-update.html\">How to get your Mac ready for macOS Sequoia</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671831/macos-wont-install-fixes.html\">How to fix macOS installation problems</a> </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sequoia Beta: Latest version </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s beta testing program for developers and public testers has been running since June/July and will continue even after the launch of macOS Sequoia to the general public. There is a separate macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta that includes Apple Intelligence features. Below you can find information about the latest beta versions and how to install them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to run the developer beta, you need to be a registered Apple software developer, which has both free and paid ($99/£79) versions. Since June 2023 Apple has opened the beta to all registered developers–so now everyone can get the earliest possible access to the macOS beta without paying a penny. Anyone can sign up for the Public Beta, which should be more stable than the developer beta, but it may still be unstable. By nature, beta software is not as stable as the final version–features may be implemented and then withdrawn, or they may not work properly, UI can change, and third-party app compatibility isn’t guaranteed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once registered, when you go to<em> System Settings</em> &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Software Update</em> on your Mac, you’ll see a new tab for <em>Beta Updates</em>, which will list the version of the beta you’re running. For example, if you want to install the developer beta select macOS 15 Public Beta, alternatively, if it’s the public beta you want, select macOS 15 Public Beta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We explain <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html\">How to join Apple’s beta program</a> separately, including details of how to get a free developer account.

We expect the public beta for macOS 15.3 to arrive shortly.

Rumors suggested that there wouldn’t be many new features in macOS 15, with AI-related improvements in iOS 18 taking most of the development focus. However, some AI improvements are coming alongside iPhone mirroring on your Mac display, a new Presenter Preview for video conferencing apps, and Game Porting Toolkit 2 for porting games between Mac, iPhone, and iPad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has announced numerous new features for the update which we will describe below. Not all the new features will be available at launch though. Some new features will come “later this year” in a subsequent software update.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone mirroring</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>iPhone mirroring is a new development of Continuity. Continuity is a feature that has existed on Macs for a number of years that means you can use your Mac together with other devices in a seamless way, making cut and paste, screen sharing and mouse and keyboard sharing possible across devices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the new ability to mirror an iPhone on a Mac’s display, it will be possible for a Mac to connect to an iPhone and display the iPhone screen on the Mac’s display. This way a user will be able to control their iPhone from their Mac, using the keyboard and mouse to interact. Drag and drop between the Mac and iPhone will also be possible. Users can also mirror the iPhone in a window on the Mac. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will also be possible to launch their iPhone apps via their Mac. Any audio from the iPhone will play through the Mac’s speakers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During any manipulation of the iPhone via the Mac, the iPhone will remain locked so nobody can see what is being done. It will also be possible to use the phone normally while it is connected to the Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users will also be able to receive iPhone notifications on a Mac. They will appear alongside Mac notifications. These can be interacted with even when the iPhone isn’t nearby.

Users will be able to view events and tasks from Reminders in the Calendar. An updated Month View will also be available and both apps will see UI changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other new features </h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iCloud</strong> – Apple is adding a “Keep Downloaded” option that prevents the file from being moved to iCloud and keeps the file on the device. Read about the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2378054/ios-18-macos-sequoia-icloud-keep-downloaded-option.html\">new Keep Downloaded option</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Installing apps</strong> – Apple is removing the double free space requirement to download and install an app. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2376714/macos-sequoia-space-initial-app-download-install.html\">macOS Sequoia makes it easier to install large apps</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Security &amp; Privacy</strong> – The beta indicates that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2429205/macos-sequoia-requires-regular-permission-checks-when-using-certain-apps.html\">macOS Sequoia will require regular permission checks when using certain apps</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gaming improvements</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023 Apple introduced the Game Porting Toolkit to help developers bring their games to Apple devices faster than ever. Now Game Porting Toolkit 2 adds the most-requested capabilities from game developers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, improvements to Game Mode on the Mac will unlock smoother frame rates, and advanced power management features boost performance across the Mac lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple proudly shared details of several gaming titles that will be coming to the Mac, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Control Ultimate Edition </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Frostpunk 2</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Palworld</li>\n\n\n\n<li>RESIDENT EVIL 7 biohazard </li>\n\n\n\n<li>RESIDENT EVIL 2</li>\n\n\n\n<li>RoboCop: Rogue City</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sniper Elite 4,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ubisoft Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown </li>\n\n\n\n<li>World of Warcraft: The War Within (coming later this year). </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wuthering Waves</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple noted that they are “leveraging powerful software technologies like MetalFX Upscaling to accelerate performance and deliver high-quality visuals across the Mac lineup” and that they are “taking advantage of the latest M3 family of chips to deliver breathtaking visuals with ray tracing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personalized Spatial Audio will result in significantly reduced audio latency with AirPods Pro (2nd generation).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Intelligence features </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Several reports over the past few months have indicated that Apple is doing a lot of work towards AI, and that generative AI (using AI to create content) will have a big role in macOS. Those reports weren’t wrong. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s new personal intelligence system is coming to Mac, iPhone, and iPad with macOS Sequoia, iOS 18, and iPadOS 18. Apple Intelligence will only be supported by Macs with an M-series chip though, so Intel Macs will not offer these new features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence FAQ: What it is, what it does, and when you’ll get it</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Writing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Intelligence will help users enhance their writing and communications. Writing Tools are built in systemwide that will offer to rewrite, proofread, and summarize text in writing-focused apps such as Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Sequoia Writing tools\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3840w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Images </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>New image capabilities will also come to M-series Macs. In Image Playground, users will be able to create images in three styles: Animation, Illustration, or Sketch.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Photos </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A new Memories in Photos feature will create a video from photos and videos based on a description provided by the user. Apple Intelligence will pick out the photos and videos, develop a storyline based on the photos, and arrange them into a movie. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, a new Clean Up tool will identify and remove unwanted objects from the background of a photo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Siri </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Siri is also getting some AI updates and ChatGPT is integrated into Siri. Because some queries will be handled off-device Apple is introducing Private Cloud Compute so that when data is sent to server-based models for processing it is not stored or made accessible to Apple</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the simplest changes to Siri is that it will be easier to type to Siri rather than having to speak to the on-device assistant. Apple may have finally twigged that people don’t always want to talk to their phones. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Next version of macOS </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Apple stopped using the names of jungle cats with macOS 10.9 Mavericks, it’s used California places to identify its annual OS updates. The last several years have been Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey, Big Sur, and Catalina. Apple has trademarked several other place names, including Condor, Mammoth, Redwood, and Sequoia. But it’s anyone guess which Californian location macOS 16 will be named after. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what next in terms of software? Expect even more Apple Intelligence features to come in the late 2025 update to macOS and expect that iOS, iPadOS and macOS will be closer than ever. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the recent past, the release has come several weeks after the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-latest-version-release-problems-features-compatibility-beta.html\">new version of iOS ships</a>.
