He also said that “at least one Mac model will get more dramatic changes,” and on Thursday, Gurman provided more details, reporting that <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-08/mac-mini-m4-apple-plans-to-release-smallest-desktop-computer-yet\" target=\"_blank\">Apple plans to redesign the M4 Mac mini as the smallest Mac ever</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first redesign of the Mac mini since <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/206168/macminimid2010.html\">2010</a> will make it similar in size to the Apple TV, which measures 3.7 by 3.7 by 1.2 inches (93 by 93 by 31 millimeters)–that’s nearly half the height and width of the current Mac mini’s 7.7 by 7.7 by 1.4 inches (19.7 by 19.7 by 3.6 centimeters). The M4 Mac mini may be taller than the current model, and the case will still be aluminum. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/174030/minioverview.html\">original Mac mini</a> released in 2005 measured 6.5 by 6.5 by 2 inches (16.5 by 16.5 by 5.1 centimeters) and had an aluminum body with a plastic top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman reports that Apple has tested three models that have at least three USB-C ports, a power connector, and an HDMI port. He did not clarify if any of the USB-C ports are also Thunderbolt ports–but it’d be surprising if Apple did not offer Thunderbolt connectivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the M2 models, Apple will likely offer the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2109165/m3-mac-mini-design-processor-specs-release-rumors.html\">Mac mini with a base M4 chip</a> like the one in the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2414833/the-m4-ipad-pro-is-impossible.html\">iPad Pro</a> and a new M4 Pro chip. The base M4 model will be available immediately, while the M4 Pro Mac mini might not be available until later in October, Gurman reports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s decision to make the Mac mini smaller isn’t surprising. There have been <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347436/mac-mini-refresh-could-bring-slimmer-design-borrow-imac-features.html\">rumors for years</a> that Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/621737/mac-mini-2022-m2-pro-redesign.html\">working on a Mac mini redesign</a> with a thinner case.  <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Mac+Mini+M2+Teardown/157365\" target=\"_blank\">Teardowns</a> of the M1 and M2 Mac mini show that the switch to M-series chips allows for smaller motherboards and other components, leaving a lot of space inside those Macs. One of the largest components in the M1 and M2 Mac mini is the fan; it doesn’t seem likely that Apple would get rid of it in the new Mac mini, since a fan is probably necessary for the M4 Pro chip.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3124cec7b5ee7a5148a516addded0210b90bfe919d99b326f81e04af69119ef4","category":"Apple"}
