Route Werks is about to satisfy those needs with The Big Handlebar Bag. That not-so-subtle name gives you the perfect picture of what’s in store – a supersized version of their incredible Handlebar Bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing25-e1638988694860.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Over four years ago now, Route Werks started with another Kickstarter project. Their original Handlebar Bag was <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/this-awesome-handlebar-bag-from-route-werks-was-fully-funded-in-6-hours/\" target=\"_blank\">funded in just 6 hours</a>, and it was <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bikerumor-editors-choice-awards-2021-zachs-best-bikes-gear-picks/\">every bit as good as promised</a>. Namely, the rigid frame and lid make for easy access while riding, and the organizational pockets and built-in accessory mounts make it so easy to bring a good amount with you and fit it on your bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-3.gif\"><img width=\"949\" height=\"1645\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-3.gif\" alt=\"Route Werks the big handlebar bag\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-4.png.avif\"><img width=\"680\" height=\"1179\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-4.png.avif\" alt=\"Route Werks the big handlebar bag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-4.png.avif 680w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-4.png-173x300.avif 173w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-4.png-69x120.avif 69w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s where The Big Handlebar Bag (TBHB) comes in. At 6L, the new bag is almost double the size of the original. That makes it big enough to fit your camera or an internal pocket insert that doubles as a cross-body bag, or even a four-pack of tall boys and a burrito! I’m assuming the internal frame on TBHB has been beefed up to accommodate the extra load. Configurable inserts will allow you to customize the storage organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-2.png.avif\"><img width=\"680\" height=\"1133\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-2.png.avif\" alt=\"Route Werks the big handlebar bag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-2.png.avif 680w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-2.png-180x300.avif 180w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-2.png-72x120.avif 72w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-1.png.avif\"><img width=\"680\" height=\"1179\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-1.png.avif\" alt=\"Route Werks the big handlebar bag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-1.png.avif 680w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-1.png-173x300.avif 173w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-1.png-69x120.avif 69w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll also need to make sure you have at least 200mm between the top of the handlebars and the front tire. It’s not recommended for bikes with suspension forks. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-6.gif.webp\"><img width=\"680\" height=\"1179\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-6.gif.webp\" alt=\"Route Werks the big handlebar bag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-6.gif.webp 680w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-6.gif-173x300.webp 173w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-6.gif-69x120.webp 69w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-5.png.avif\"><img width=\"680\" height=\"1179\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-5.png.avif\" alt=\"Route Werks the big handlebar bag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-5.png.avif 680w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-5.png-173x300.avif 173w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-5.png-69x120.avif 69w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the extra storage room, there are also extra gadget-carrying capabilities with three different electronic mounts on the lid. With adapters from Barfly or Quad Lock, or Peak, you can mount just about anything from phones, to GPS computers, GoPros, lights, etc. But there are also the two handlebar stub mounts on the side of the bag to mount lights or bells. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those new to the Route Werks bag, the system uses a rigid handlebar mount that includes a quick release to install and remove the bag from the bar. The mount works very well and can be adjusted so that there is no play or rattling to the connection. The mount is available to fit 35mm or 31.8mm bars, and the 31.8mm version can be shimmed to fit 26.0 or 25.4mm bars as well. Note that the Big Bag is not recommended for carbon bars due to the weight and clamping force needed to keep it in place.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-7.png.avif\"><img width=\"680\" height=\"1179\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-7.png.avif\" alt=\"Route Werks the big handlebar bag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-7.png.avif 680w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-7.png-173x300.avif 173w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter-7.png-69x120.avif 69w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the original Handlebar Bag, The Big Handlebar Bag is currently only offered through a Kickstarter campaign which has already <em>crushed</em> its goal. The minimum pledge to get a bag is $165 which is 28% off the retail price of $230. There are 18 days left on the Kickstarter order window, with production expected to begin in early 2025 and delivery to backers by April 2025. As always, crowdfunding campaigns come with a degree of risk, so back accordingly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/routewerks/the-big-handlebar-bag/description\" target=\"_blank\"><em>kickstarter.com</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/route-werks-the-big-handlebar-bag-kickstarter/\">Route Werks Goes Large with The Big Handlebar Bag</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"66dfffc53f0fca032cf4025c5751a33c0e77bfddf8601bf2632c363739b5f864","category":"Cycling"}
