{"title":"Apple Settles Lawsuit Against Former Employee Who Leaked to The Information and WSJ","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/07/apple-leaker-issues-apology/","date":1738951853000,"content":"\n<p>Joe Rossignol, reporting for MacRumors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Last year, we reported that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/apple-sues-former-employee-for-alleged-leaking/\">Apple sued its former software\nengineer Andrew Aude</a> for providing journalists with\nconfidential information about the company’s future plans,\nincluding <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/21/apple-launching-journaling-app/\">details about the Journal app</a>, Vision Pro\nheadset, and more.</p>\n\n<p>As reported <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/07/former-leaker-sued-by-apple-has-now-apologized-as-the-lawsuit-is-dismissed/\">by 9to5Mac</a>, the Superior Court of Santa Clara\nCounty on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/825250528/Apple-Inc-v-Andrew-Aude-Stipulation-of-Dismissal\">dismissed the lawsuit</a> after Apple and\nAude reached an agreement to resolve this matter. The court\ndocument for the case’s dismissal does not provide any specific\ndetails about the agreement, but Aude issued a public apology on\nthe same day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/andyaude1/status/1887639465574998500\">Aude’s apology, on X</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I spent nearly eight years as a software engineer at Apple. During\nthat time, I was given access to sensitive internal Apple\ninformation, including what were then unreleased products and\nfeatures. But instead of keeping this information secret, I made\nthe mistake of sharing this information with journalists who\ncovered the company. I did not realize it at the time, but this\nturned out to be a profound and expensive mistake. Hundreds of\nprofessional relationships I had spent years building were ruined.\nAnd my otherwise successful career as a software engineer was\nderailed, and it will likely be very difficult to rebuild it.\nLeaking was not worth it. I sincerely apologize to my former\ncolleagues who not only worked tirelessly on projects for Apple,\nbut work hard to keep them secret. They deserved better.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We don’t know the terms of Aude’s agreement with Apple that ended the lawsuit, but it’s good to see he and the company remain on close enough terms for Apple to have helped him craft that apology. (Either that, or Aude should have worked in Apple’s comms department, not engineering.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/28/apple-sues-leaker-andrew-aude\">Here’s my post from last March</a> when the lawsuit was filed, which includes a few of the juiciest nuggets, including this, from Apple’s filing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple learned of Mr. Aude’s misconduct in the fall of 2023. When\nApple met with him to discuss his improper disclosures, Mr. Aude\npromptly confirmed his guilt through his actions, if not his\nwords. At the start of his November 7, 2023 interview, Mr. Aude\nrepeatedly denied that he had leaked any information to anyone. He\nalso claimed that he did not have his Apple-issued work iPhone\nwith him. Feigning the need to visit the bathroom mid-interview,\nMr. Aude then extracted his iPhone from his pocket during the\nbreak and permanently deleted significant amounts of evidence from\nhis device. This included the Signal app, which memorialized his\nhistory of leaking information to “Homeboy” (and likely others)\nvia encrypted communications. [...]</p>\n\n<p>In Mr. Aude’s screenshot below memorializing his exchange with the\nWSJ journalist, Mr. Aude exclaimed that he could not “wait for\nchaos to break out” in reaction to a forthcoming article reflecting\nhis leaked information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>End-to-end encrypted comms don’t help much when you save screenshots of those chats to your work-issued company-controlled device.</p>\n\n<p>And my own closing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Worth noting that Aaron “Homeboy” Tilley <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/u/aarontilley\">was a reporter for The\nInformation</a> until September 2019, when he left to join\nthe WSJ. Anyway, I’m sure the WSJ will help Aude out with his\nlegal bills.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/07/apple-settles-lawsuit-with-leaker\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"36e694185d6b2972c244370f2ed92e60a5bbdb287af57f2f7c1543728c9658ef","category":"Tech"}
