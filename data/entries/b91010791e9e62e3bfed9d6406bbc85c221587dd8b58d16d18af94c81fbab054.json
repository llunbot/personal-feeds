Even if I don’t put in as many kms as I’d like, on the one gravel bike I have set up with a dynamo, at the moment. In a time where daytime running lights will keep me safer on the road, GPS mapping can lead me to discover new places to ride, my smartphone is an excellent mobile camera to share those rides, and derailleur batteries are quickly recharged via USB… the idea of self-sufficient power as I pedal is always enticing. I’ve had every type of electronic device die on a ride before. But never on my dynamo-equipped bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now SON Nabendynamo has their first new hub dynamo in several years.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo-is-hidden-behind-the-disc-brake-rotor.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo-is-hidden-behind-the-disc-brake-rotor.jpg\" alt=\"SON 29 S sleek low-profile hub dynamo hidden behind the disc brake rotor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo-is-hidden-behind-the-disc-brake-rotor.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo-is-hidden-behind-the-disc-brake-rotor-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo-is-hidden-behind-the-disc-brake-rotor-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo-is-hidden-behind-the-disc-brake-rotor-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo-is-hidden-behind-the-disc-brake-rotor-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo-is-hidden-behind-the-disc-brake-rotor-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo-is-hidden-behind-the-disc-brake-rotor-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The SON 29 S is a lower-profile hub with a new generator design tucked into an oversized disc-side hub flange, developed for the performance-oriented adventure market. On the bike, it almost disappears behind even a small disc brake rotor, giving you a more modern aesthetic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo_6-bolt-disc-brake-side-flange.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo_6-bolt-disc-brake-side-flange.jpg\" alt=\"SON 29 S sleek low-profile hub dynamo, 6-bolt disc\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo_6-bolt-disc-brake-side-flange.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo_6-bolt-disc-brake-side-flange-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo_6-bolt-disc-brake-side-flange-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo_6-bolt-disc-brake-side-flange-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo_6-bolt-disc-brake-side-flange-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo_6-bolt-disc-brake-side-flange-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo_6-bolt-disc-brake-side-flange-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The generator inside the SON 29 S dynamo hub may be narrow, but it is still designed to put out the same 6V/3W power as a regular dynamo. Like the 28, SON again optimized the 29 S for power output at relatively low speeds and 29″ wheel – outputting 6V from around 15km/hr (StVZO-compliant). According to SON, “together with smart charging electronics, it enables especially high power output” so you can not only power your lights but also recharge all of your gadgets once you are riding at a constant speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SON meant the 12mm thru-axle 6-bolt disc  29 S hub for road or gravel wheels, with straight-pull spokes. It features radially lacing on the driveside, and 2x on the disc side. The 29 S offers symmetric 32-hole drilling or 2:1 drilling for 24-spoke wheel builds, and comes only in black.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new dynamo comes standard with SON’s easy-plug coaxial connector (like shown <em>above</em>). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-SL-Self-Connecting-hub-dynamo-on-an-Urwahn-fork.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-SL-Self-Connecting-hub-dynamo-on-an-Urwahn-fork.jpg\" alt=\"SON SL Connect\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-SL-Self-Connecting-hub-dynamo-on-an-Urwahn-fork.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-SL-Self-Connecting-hub-dynamo-on-an-Urwahn-fork-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-SL-Self-Connecting-hub-dynamo-on-an-Urwahn-fork-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-SL-Self-Connecting-hub-dynamo-on-an-Urwahn-fork-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-SL-Self-Connecting-hub-dynamo-on-an-Urwahn-fork-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/SON)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But it will also be possible to get one to work with SON’s self-connecting SL interface that integrates a powered ring directly into the dropout (like on this red fork that comes on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=urwahn\" target=\"_blank\">Urwahn</a> bikes). Then you don’t even need to unplug the dynamo to remove the front wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>SON 29 S dynamo – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo_driveside-flange.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo_driveside-flange.jpg\" alt=\"SON 29 S sleek low-profile hub dynamo, 12mm thru-axle with stright-pull spokes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo_driveside-flange.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo_driveside-flange-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo_driveside-flange-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo_driveside-flange-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo_driveside-flange-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo_driveside-flange-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo_driveside-flange-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the straight-pull hub design requires a bit more expertise to build up, at first SON is only offering the new SON 29 S dynamo hub in wheels built by them now in Germany. Complete front wheel builds start at 550€ with an alloy DT Swiss rim for road or gravel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that said, expect the new hub to also be available soon to reputable professional wheelbuilders for custom builds. And with its narrow design and 2:1 24-hole option, we expect to see a number of carbon road, all-road, and gravel wheels built up with the new SON 29 S hub dynamo in time for the start of next year’s adventure racing season.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Ladelux LED dynamo headlight, too</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo-connected-to-smart-Ladelux-LED-USB-charging-headlight.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo-connected-to-smart-Ladelux-LED-USB-charging-headlight.jpg\" alt=\"SON 29 S sleek low-profile hub dynamo powers new smart Ladelux LED high-beam USB-chargin headlight  \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo-connected-to-smart-Ladelux-LED-USB-charging-headlight.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo-connected-to-smart-Ladelux-LED-USB-charging-headlight-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo-connected-to-smart-Ladelux-LED-USB-charging-headlight-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo-connected-to-smart-Ladelux-LED-USB-charging-headlight-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo-connected-to-smart-Ladelux-LED-USB-charging-headlight-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo-connected-to-smart-Ladelux-LED-USB-charging-headlight-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SON-29-S-sleek-low-profile-hub-dynamo-connected-to-smart-Ladelux-LED-USB-charging-headlight-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the innovative new dynamo hub, SON also has a smart new Ladelux dynamo-powered headlight, with low &amp; high beams. SON designed the Ladelux for smooth output USB-charging of your electronics with a small internal buffer battery. And SON claims it is able to draw more power from a hub dynamo than any other charging device on the market (from 700c riding speed of &gt;30km/hr) making it perfect for the adventure racer with lots of gadgets to keep juiced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 480€ Ladelux puts out 120/180Lux at any speed, backed by a 1200mAh battery inside, and includes a handlebar switch and magnetic charging cable for your smart device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://nabendynamo.de/\" target=\"_blank\">NabenDynamo.de</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/son-29-s-creates-dynamo-hub-so-tiny-it-disappears-behind-your-brake-rotor/\">SON 29 S Creates Dynamo Hub So Tiny, It Disappears Behind Your Brake Rotor</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b91010791e9e62e3bfed9d6406bbc85c221587dd8b58d16d18af94c81fbab054","category":"Cycling"}
