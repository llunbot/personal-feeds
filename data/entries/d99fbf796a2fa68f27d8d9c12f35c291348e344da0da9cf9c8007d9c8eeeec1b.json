But there's a handy clipboard trick that's worth keeping in mind.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/copy-paste-shortcut.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nIn Windows, the Copy and Paste key combinations are <strong>Control-C</strong> and <strong>Control-V</strong>, respectively. On the Mac, it's very similar – all you do is use the <strong>Command (⌘)</strong> key instead of Control. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nBut did you know that you can also paste text without its original formatting? Not knowing that this is possible on a Mac, many users paste text into a plain-format text editor to strip it of any styling before copying and pasting it again to its intended destination. But you don't have to do that.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/strip-formatting-shortcut.jpg\" alt=\"strip formatting\" width=\"2899\" height=\"1182\" />\r<br />\nIf you'd rather directly paste the copied text elsewhere as purely plain text, use the key combination <strong>Command-Option-Shift-V</strong> and it will be automatically stripped of any formatting. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis is a system-wide shortcut, so you can use it almost anywhere in macOS that accepts text input.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/macos-copy-paste-text-without-formatting/\">macOS Quick Tip: Copy and Paste Text Without Formatting</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-quick-tip-copy-and-paste-text-without-formatting.2455828/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d99fbf796a2fa68f27d8d9c12f35c291348e344da0da9cf9c8007d9c8eeeec1b","category":"Apple"}
