That timing, Gurman says, will likely take things \"deeper into next month\" for a launch of the new iPads although an announcement could happen a bit sooner.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlongside revamped ‌iPad Pro‌ models with OLED displays, Apple's M3 chip, and additional enhancements, we're also expecting updated ‌iPad Air‌ models including a new 12.9-inch size option.
