That may give smartphone makers enough time to use the cells in thinner models launching this year, he suggested.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"We've made good progress, and we're shipping them very soon,\" Saito said, adding that \"some handset makers might be able to use the new battery in their product one generation early.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe timing could be soon enough for Apple's expected September launch of the iPhone 17 Air, which is rumored to measure just <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/\">5.5mm at its thinnest point</a>, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTDK's batteries use silicon for anodes instead of the traditional graphite, allowing them to pack 15% more energy into the same space compared to conventional rechargeable battery packs. This advancement could be key to maintaining adequate battery life in such a slim form factor.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHaving said that, reports have been mixed regarding the iPhone 17 Air's potential battery performance. While <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma claimed the device will have \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-17-air-battery-case-report/\">worse</a>\" battery life compared to previous iPhone models, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman offered a more optimistic outlook, stating that battery life would be \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/iphone-17-air-price-battery-life-more/\">on par with current iPhones</a>\" thanks to hardware and software optimizations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFurther supporting the possibility of decent battery life, Kuo recently mentioned in a blog post that the iPhone 17 Air will feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/iphone-17-air-high-density-battery-rumor/\">\"high-density\" battery</a>, although he didn't elaborate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe device is also rumored to incorporate Apple's power-efficient C1 modem and lack an Ultra Wide camera, potentially providing more internal space for a larger battery.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLooking further ahead, a recent report from <em>ETNews</em> has suggested that Apple could adopt <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/14/2027-iphone-game-changing-silicon-battery/\">advanced silicon battery technology</a> for its 2027 iPhone, marking the 20th anniversary of the iconic device. The next-generation battery could theoretically use pure silicon anodes, which can store up to 10 times more lithium ions per gram than current materials.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTDK is already working on its fourth-generation silicon batteries, according to the company's CEO. \"We plan to introduce fourth-generation silicon batteries sometime in the next fiscal year to widen our lead even further,\" said Saito, claiming that \"mass-producing silicon batteries requires special know-how. It's not like you can do it by just putting the materials together.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe 6.6-inch iPhone 17 Air is expected to replace the Plus model in Apple's 2025 lineup, and is likely to be announced in September, per Apple's typical fall release schedule.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/\">iPhone 17 Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/16/iphone-17-air-advanced-silicon-battery/\">iPhone 17 Air Could Debut Advanced Silicon Battery Tech</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-air-could-debut-advanced-silicon-battery-tech.2457204/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"153abd9a1bc383e3808568f20b01abe2f0c2c3e96683db75d0c9af69edc87ec4","category":"Apple"}
