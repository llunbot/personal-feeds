In addition, the summary report was provided to the Union Cycliste Internationale – the governing body under which British Cycling operates – and to the United Kingdom Department of Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport for their attention.</p><p>“‘Operation Echo’ makes no corrective recommendations as those involved in the events of 2011 are no longer employed by UKAD, and UKAD has already put safeguards in place to avoid a repeat occurrence. It is important to acknowledge that WADA I&amp;I received the full cooperation and transparency of British Cycling and UKAD throughout our investigation.”</p><p>In a statement, British Cycling said that it had “only conducted the testing having sought and received the express approval of UKAD’s Director of Legal.”</p><p>Operation Echo also looked into allegations that the UKAD had given athletes’ biological passport data to British Cycling, and that it had allowed two athletes to privately test supplements for potential contamination as part of their defenses in adverse analytical finding cases and then use the results in anti-doping hearings. The investigation did not find evidence to support any of those allegations.</p></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"4eaf94c1f385374ae1c06de1be0f5369870a9345967250822454feea215ec267","category":"Cycling"}
