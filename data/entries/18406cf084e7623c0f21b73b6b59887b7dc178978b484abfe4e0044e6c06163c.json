After initially ruling out the race from his programme, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tadej-pogacar-interview\">Tadej Pogačar</a> will make his long-awaited Paris-Roubaix debut this weekend after all, and will be starting the race with one genuine objective: victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A reigning Tour de France champion hasn’t raced Paris-Roubaix since 1991, when Greg LeMond tackled the French cobbles. The last time a reigning Tour winner won Roubaix was back in 1973, courtesy of (you guessed it) <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pogacar-vs-merckx\">Eddy Merckx</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considered to be the greatest cyclist of our time (and by many of <em>all</em> time), reigning world champion Pogačar will go into the race as one of <em>the</em> riders to watch. Paris-Roubaix is a unique challenge for Pogačar, with some already touting him for glory on his debut. But the question on everyone’s lips remains: ‘Can Tadej Pogačar <em>really </em>win Paris-Roubaix?’</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>He’s got the form and the confidence needed</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-5-1-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-5-1-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-5-1-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-5-1-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-5-1-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-5-1-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-5-1-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-5-1-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-5-1-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-5-1-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-5-1-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Xavier Pereyron</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, let’s remove any Paris-Roubaix nuance from the equation. Tadej Pogačar is on incredible form. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is coming into the race with a Strade Bianche and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-flanders-2025-gallery\">Tour of Flanders victory</a> under his belt. He dislodged Mathieu van der Poel, Mads Pedersen and Wout van Aert in Flanders to take his eighth Monument title. He’s definitely acclimatised to uneven road surfaces. His acceleration is where it needs to be to get away from his competitors, and he hasn’t over-exerted himself in recent weeks chasing other Classics titles, unlike some of his rivals on the start line on Sunday, who may be starting to feel the pinch of their recent efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After his initial sheepishness to address the big Roubaix question mark, the Slovenian convinced his UAE Team Emirates bosses to add the Queen of the Classics into his schedule in March. He’s since headed to France, done recons and smashed the Strava segment record on several sectors, including the five-star <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-mons-en-pevele\">Mons-en-Pévèle</a> and four-star Auchy-lez-Orchies à Bersée.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has carefully curated his schedule around the Tour de France, but he’s calculated that Paris-Roubaix is worth the risk, even with a packed Ardennes schedule on the horizon. He’s even released a new line of merchandise to commemorate his historic Roubaix appearance. A necessary confidence is evidently there, as is the hunger for victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+2\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-970x300.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>A proven track record on the cobbles</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1407146220-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"WALLERS, FRANCE - JULY 06: Jasper Stuyven of Belgium and Team Trek - Segafredo and Tadej Pogacar of Slovenia and UAE Team Emirates - White Best Young Rider Jersey compete passing through a cobblestones sector while fans cheer during the 109th Tour de France 2022, Stage 5 a 157km stage from Lille to Wallers-Arenberg / #TDF2022 / #WorldTour / on July 06, 2022 in Wallers, France.\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1407146220-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1407146220-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1407146220-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1407146220-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1407146220-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1407146220-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1407146220-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1407146220-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1407146220-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1407146220-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption> </figcaption><figcaption>Bernard Papon - Pool/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Pogačar hasn’t taken part in Paris-Roubaix before (at the elite level at least), he has raced across many of the cobbled sectors it takes in. On the fifth stage of the 2022 Tour de France, the Slovenian launched a bold move alongside Jasper Stuyven on the pavé. Together they drew out a gap of around 30 seconds while a splintered peloton chased behind. They eventually rolled over the finish line with a more moderate 13 seconds, but that’s enough to see some evidence of expertise on the French cobbles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several caveats to address here. This previous performance was during a Grand Tour, on a stage that was much shorter than Paris-Roubaix. It was the summer with good conditions and there were no five-star sectors. Mathieu van der Poel was out of form and Wout van Aert crashed. With these observations noted, it’s fair to say that this might be a tainted example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned though, Pogačar has already performed several recons of the route, including the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-arenberg-forest\">Trouée d’Arenberg</a>. He recorded Strava bests on some of the sectors, and he doesn’t need time to warm up to a race to taste success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On his debut at the Tour of Flanders, Pogačar came close to victory when up against Van der Poel in 2022. Tactical blunders, on the other hand, left him in fourth place. The Ronde may be cobbled, but it’s a different kettle of fish. The total amount of elevation in that race – just over 2,000m – is much tougher than Paris-Roubaix, a race crafted for hyper-specialists. Debutants rarely win this Monument, with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-win-paris-roubaix#:~:text=Win%20a%20two%2Dup%20sprint&amp;text=The%20build%2Dup%20to%20the,like%20a%20Magic%208%20Ball.\">the exception of Sonny Colbrelli</a>, who took the title in 2021 on his first and only appearance at the race. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bear in mind, Paris-Roubaix is unique. Luck can play a huge role in race results, and the tactics can often lead to debutants showing their hand too early on the day. Pogačar will have done his homework, but the proof will be in the pudding.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n

/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a rarity to see a Tour de France champion on the start line of Paris-Roubaix, let alone the reigning champion. Due to the risks of entering the Hell of the North, the reigning <em>maillot jaune</em> holder has steered well clear of this race for the past 34 years. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/no-slowing-down-greg-lemond-profile\">Greg LeMond</a> was the last Tour winner to take part in Paris-Roubaix ahead of a title defence at the Tour. On that occasion, he finished in 55th (and could only manage 7th at the Tour later in the year).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pogačar’s not worried about this well-documented risk, telling the press last month that ‘Roubaix isn’t worse than any other race’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, there’s a low conversion rate for Grand Tour winners at Paris-Roubaix. Just 12 Giro, Tour and Vuelta victors have Paris-Roubaix alongside a three-weeker in their <em>palmarès</em>. That’s just under 10% of the total winners of this race. A total of ten Tour winners have won Paris-Roubaix during their careers: Henri Cornet, Octave Lapize, Henri Pélissier, André Leducq, Sylvère Maes, Fausto Coppi, Louison Bobet, Jan Janssen, Eddy Merckx and Bernard Hinault. Hinault won Paris-Roubaix in 1981 while in the rainbow jersey, three months before winning his third Tour. This, however, was not his first dabble on the pavé. It was his fourth attempt. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More recently, Bradley Wiggins re-dipped his toe into Roubaix during the twilight of his professional career with Team Sky. His best finish was ninth place at the 2014 race. This came after six previous Paris-Roubaix appearances, however, not at his first time of asking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More unsettling for Pogačar is the record for <em>reigning </em>Tour winners in Paris-Roubaix. Only three <em>maillot jaune</em> winners have managed to win Paris-Roubaix the following spring: Fausto Coppi (1950), Louison Bobet (1956) and Eddy Merckx (1970 and 1973). History is stacked against Pogačar, but he’s managed to dispel these kinds of odds before.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Assessing the competition</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-106-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-106-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-106-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-106-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-106-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-106-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-106-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-106-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-106-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-106-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-106-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Xavier Pereyron</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Paris-Roubaix always benefits from a stellar start list. Given its reputation as the most prestigious one-day race on the calendar, it’s no surprise to see a ring of former world champions, Monument winners and Classics rivals eager to rain on Pogačar’s rainbow parade this weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two-time winner Mathieu van der Poel is the obvious rival here. The Alpecin-Decueninck rider has an impressive record in Roubaix, having made the podium on three of his four appearances. When supported by two-time runner-up Jasper Philipsen, former gravel world champion Gianni Vermeersch and 2018 second-place finisher Silvan Dillier, Van der Poel’s team will be the most proven. He can be confident about his sprint as well if he sticks with Pogačar, given that he has beaten the Slovenian already this year in a three-up dash at Milan-San Remo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wout van Aert has been suffering from somewhat of a Roubaix curse in recent years. Despite being the favourite on several occasions, the Belgian has failed to convert that into cobblewear in his five appearances. Van Aert can also rely on his sprint, but his legs have looked hot and cold since the beginning of this season, although he did seem improved at last week’s Tour of Flanders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fierce sprinting opposition continues when we throw last year’s bronze medallist Mads Pedersen into the mix. The Dane has a strong engine on the flat, with teammate Jasper Stuyven for company. The Lidl-Trek boys look to be on good form and both could work in collaboration to keep Pogačar out of the mix when the race approaches the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-velodrome\">Roubaix Velodrome</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined, these guys provide a strong argument against Pogačar’s title chances on Sunday. All of the competitors mentioned are usually much faster than him in a sprint and are more proven in Paris-Roubaix. That said, the race has been claimed by a solo move over the past three years, much like the Tour of Flanders. Pogačar has the necessary bike handling to get over the cobbles, and he’s a wildly different rider to the similar profiles of Van Aert, Van der Poel and Pedersen, who may over-analyse their fellow favourites and try to keep their powder dry for a potential dash to the line inside the velodrome.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How can he pull it off?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-85-min-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-85-min-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-85-min-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-85-min-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-85-min-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-85-min-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-85-min-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-85-min-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-85-min-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-85-min-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-85-min-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-85-min-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Xavier Pereyron</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how could Pogačar actually win this race?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, he’d have to go solo if Van der Poel, Van Aert or Pedersen are in the mix once again. Mons-en-Pévèle, a segment the Slovenian recently conquered on Strava, is very Pogačar-friendly. Its slightly uphill nature could offer Pogačar a rare chance to benefit from his climbing legs. It’s hard to know whether he’ll be strong enough to break free elsewhere though, given how unproven he is on flatter five-star sectors like the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-carrefour-de-l-arbre\" target=\"_blank\">Carrefour de l’Arbre</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, don’t underestimate Pogačar’s engine on the flat. He managed to extend his gap on the flat arrival into Oudenaarde at the Tour of Flanders against a strong group, consisting of most of his likely Roubaix enemies. He’s also a consistent time-triallist, a skill set that often translates to strong Roubaix results. Pogačar may be faster than you think in a fatigue-fuelled sprint too – he’s bettered Van Aert and Pedersen at the end of Classics before (the GP Montréal and 2023 UCI Road World Championships), so he may pull something out of the bag with over 250km in the legs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, it wouldn’t be shocking if Pogačar wins Paris-Roubaix this weekend. He’s the most all-round bike rider in the world right now and he’ll no doubt be a factor on Sunday, whether it ends in victory or not. It’ll be a tough ask for UAE Team Emirates, but there’s a real chance that we see Tadej Pogačar enter the Roubaix Velodrome in front on Sunday, showcasing another side to his incredible portfolio.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tadej-pogacar-paris-roubaix-favourite\">Can Tadej Pogačar actually win Paris-Roubaix 2025?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"18406cf084e7623c0f21b73b6b59887b7dc178978b484abfe4e0044e6c06163c","category":"Cycling"}
