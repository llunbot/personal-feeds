This may have helped the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wari_culture\">Wari</a> forge political alliances and expand their empire.</p>\n<p>Now archaeologists have discovered direct evidence that the use of vilca was a common practice some 1,000 years earlier than the Wari, thanks to analysis of artifacts unearthed at Chavín de Huántar, located about 250 kilometers north of Lima, Peru. And the Chavín people may have used it for a different purpose: to reinforce social hierarchies by limiting consumption of those substances to an elite few, according to a new paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>\n<p>There is ample evidence that humans in many cultures throughout history used various hallucinogenic substances in religious ceremonies or shamanic rituals. That includes <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/study-confirms-egyptians-likely-used-hallucinogens-in-rituals/\">ancient Egypt</a>, as well as ancient Greek, Vedic, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/study-the-maya-blessed-their-ball-courts-in-rituals-with-hallucinogenic-plants/\">Maya</a>, Inca, and Aztec cultures. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urarina\">Urarina</a> people who live in the Peruvian Amazon Basin still use a psychoactive brew called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca\">ayahuasca</a> in their rituals, and Westerners seeking their own brand of enlightenment have been known to participate. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wari_Empire\">Wari empire</a> lasted from around 500 CE to 1100 CE in the central highlands of Peru.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/only-elites-used-hallucinogens-in-ancient-andes-society/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/only-elites-used-hallucinogens-in-ancient-andes-society/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"28e993efa558ecfba81ae00e31eec67be30a0dd8719560326763e5b64ddcf708","category":"Tech"}
