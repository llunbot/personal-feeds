Researchers at the National University of Singapore (NUS) have developed a new method that uses ultrasound to more evenly distribute graphene oxide (GO) in ceramics, according to a <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsomega.4c05798\">new paper</a> published in the journal ACS Omega. And as a bonus, they collaborated with an artist who used the resulting ceramic tiles to create a unique art exhibit at the NUS Museum—a striking merger of science and art.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/08/graphene-veils-may-hold-the-secret-to-conserving-priceless-works-of-art/\">reported previously</a>, graphene is the thinnest material yet known, composed of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. That structure gives it many unusual properties that hold great promise for real-world applications: batteries, super capacitors, antennas, water filters, transistors, solar cells, and touchscreens, just to name a few.</p>\n<p>In 2021, scientists found that this wonder material might also provide a solution to the fading of colors of many artistic masterpieces. For instance, several of Georgia O'Keeffe's oil paintings housed in the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico, have developed tiny <a href=\"https://news.northwestern.edu/for-journalists/press-kits/2019-aaas-conference/georgia-okeeffe/\">pin-sized blisters</a>, almost like acne, for decades. Conservators have found similar deterioration in oil-based masterpieces across all time periods, including works by Rembrandt.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/graphene-enhanced-ceramic-tiles-make-striking-art/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/graphene-enhanced-ceramic-tiles-make-striking-art/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b0cb0d2ec8277a7c39cc992477e74edcbc479da1a635dea1bd53546cdbccb39c","category":"Tech"}
