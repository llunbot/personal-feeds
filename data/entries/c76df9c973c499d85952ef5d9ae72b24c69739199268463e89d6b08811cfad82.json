Without that one-time charge, Apple's profits would have been $1.64 per share, up 12 percent year-over-year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGross margin for the quarter was 46.2 percent, compared to 45.2 percent in the year-ago quarter. Apple also declared a quarterly dividend payment of $0.25 per share, payable on November 14 to shareholders of record as of November 11.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor the full fiscal year, Apple recorded $391.0 billion in sales and $93.7 billion in net income, compared to $383.3 billion in sales and $97.0 billion in net income for fiscal 2023.<blockquote>\"Today Apple is reporting a new September quarter revenue record of $94.9 billion, up 6 percent from a year ago,\" said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. \"During the quarter, we were excited to announce our best products yet, with the all-new iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4, and remarkable features for hearing health and sleep apnea detection. And this week, we released our first set of features for Apple Intelligence, which sets a new standard for privacy in AI and supercharges our lineup heading into the holiday season.\"</blockquote>As has been the case for over four years now, Apple is once again not issuing guidance for the current quarter ending in December.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/aapl-4q-2024-pie-chart.jpg\" width=\"2178\" height=\"1162\" />\r<br />\nApple will <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/\">provide live streaming</a> of its fiscal Q4 2024 financial results conference call at 2:00 pm Pacific, and <em>MacRumors</em> will update this story with coverage of the conference call highlights.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>Conference call starts at 2:00 p.m. Pacific - No need to refresh</b> <img src=\"https://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/01/loading.gif\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div>Loading live updates...</div> \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/\">Earnings</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/31/apple-4q-2024-earnings/\">Apple Reports 4Q 2024 Results: $14.7B Profit on $94.9B Revenue</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reports-4q-2024-results-14-7b-profit-on-94-9b-revenue.2441640/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Jordan Golson","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c76df9c973c499d85952ef5d9ae72b24c69739199268463e89d6b08811cfad82","category":"Apple"}
