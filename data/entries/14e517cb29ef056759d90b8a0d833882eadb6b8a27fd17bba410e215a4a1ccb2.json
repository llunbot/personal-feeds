With fully 15 teams still without a stage win as the riders rolled out of Mourenx, the action was fast and furious from the start.</p>\n<p>But eventually a group of 20 riders came together and once Ineos Grenadiers and Israel Start-Up Nation were persuaded by yellow jersey Tadej Pogacar to stop chasing, the gap quickly shot up as the peloton downed tools and let them go.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8632/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-tour-de-france-2021\">How to watch and live stream the Tour de France 2021</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1755/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2021: Everything you need to know</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nMaybe Pogacar knew something we didn’t – at this point we wouldn’t be surprised – since that inadvertently set countryman Mohoric on his way to victory.</p>\n<p>It didn’t come easy for the Slovenian national champion, but driving a huge gear directly into the wind with his head down, he pushed on while the rest of the group fought over who was going to chase and who wasn’t, and that was that.</p>\n<p>The victory made for a welcome distraction for Bahrain Victorious after it emerged the <a href=\"/news/9885/bahrain-victorious-hotel-and-bus-searched-by-police\" target=\"_blank\">team's hotel had been searched by French police</a> on Thursday night, allegedly amid doping suspicions.</p>\n<p>Now it’s on to the Tour’s final weekend, with first a time-trial tomorrow and then the traditional procession into Paris on Sunday almost certainly culminating in a bunch sprint on the Champs-Élysées.</p>\n<p>The smart money is surely on a peloton-breaking performance (again) from Pogacar tomorrow and – dare we say it – a record-breaking one from Mark Cavendish on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Here’s a taste of the action from Stage 19 of the 2021 Tour de France courtesy of Cyclist photographer Chris Auld:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9894/tour-de-france-2021-stage-19-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 29</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/tour_de_france_2021_stage_19_01.jpg?itok=B9FbLArg\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 1 of </span>29</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/9894/tour-de-france-2021-stage-19-gallery\">Tour de France 2021 Stage 19 gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/authors/chris-auld\">Chris Auld</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>17 Jul 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9894%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-19-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Tour%20de%20France%202021%20Stage%2019%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9894%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-19-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Tour%20de%20France%202021%20Stage%2019%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9894%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-19-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Tour%20de%20France%202021%20Stage%2019%20gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9894%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-19-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9894/tour-de-france-2021-stage-19-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 29</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/tour_de_france_2021_stage_19_01.jpg?itok=B9FbLArg\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"14e517cb29ef056759d90b8a0d833882eadb6b8a27fd17bba410e215a4a1ccb2","category":"Cycling"}
