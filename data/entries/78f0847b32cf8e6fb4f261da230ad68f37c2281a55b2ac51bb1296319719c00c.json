These rigid steel frames were inspired by beach cruisers and the motocross bikes of the day. They had slack head angles, low bottom brackets and long wheelbases to maximise stability.</p>\n<p>As purpose-built <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike/\">mountain bikes</a> began to hit the mainstream around a decade later, their geometry looked more akin to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-under-3000/\">road bikes</a>. Stems grew longer, wheelbases shrank and head angles began to steepen.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, those days are well and truly over. In the last 10 years, the development of progressive geometry has accelerated. Industry outliers, increasingly technical trails and racetrack research adn development have all played their part in the continuous evolution of what <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-bike-geometry-and-handling/\">MTB geometry</a> looks like today.</p>\n<p>Are we still on a curve of innovation, or has the industry started to apply the brakes on progressive geometry? Let’s look at some of the best downhill, enduro and trail bikes to see how their geometry has changed.</p>\n\n<h2>Downhill bikes</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Person riding downhill bike through woods.\" title=\"MBK_426_biketest.TH_356A5217-Enhanced-NR\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Downhill bikes have the most progressive geometries out of all the mountain bike disciplines.</span></figcaption><span> <i> Tom Hardman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Downhill bikes have to tackle the world’s gnarliest off-road terrain at incredibly fast speeds. They are machines focused on descending, so surely this is where the gnarliest, no-compromise geometry can be found.</p>\n<p>Looking at the geometry charts of two of the most popular <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downhill-mountain-bikes/\">downhill bikes</a> on the market, the Specialized Demo and Canyon Sender, we can see downhill bike geometry has barely changed in the last five years.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Sender CFR downhill mountain bike\" title=\"Canyon Sender CFR-2\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Downhill bike geometry has remained relatively unchanged for a long time.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans</i></span></div>\n<p>Let’s start with the head angle. Since its launch in 2016, the Canyon Sender has stuck with the same 63-degree head angle, despite being revised a handful of times.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Demo downhill mountain bike.\" title=\"Specialized Demo Race\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Specialized has been teasing a new Demo at UCI Downhill World Cups.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr</i></span></div>\n<p>Comparatively, the Specialized Demo, which sported a 63.5-degree head angle back in 2018, now sits at 63.2 degrees as standard. The head angle underwent a considerable slackening in 2019 before gradually steepening to within 0.2 degrees of its original head angle.</p>\n<p>What about length? Well, the reach grew from 460mm for a size-large Sender to 485mm in 2021, but it hasn’t changed since. We see a similar story with the Specialized: a size medium Demo has grown by only four millimetres over the past half-decade.</p>\n<h2>Enduro bikes</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Norco Range C1 high pivot trail mountain bike ridden by male mountain bike tester Alex Evans on a trail called Too Hard For EWS in Scotland's Tweed Valley in the UK.\" title=\"Norco Range C1 high pivot enduro mountain bike-29\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Enduro bikes have become more aggressive over the past half-decade, with more capable geometries.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-enduro-bikes/\">best enduro bikes</a> are designed to go long distances on extreme terrain and stand up to serious abuse, but you should still be able to pedal comfortably on the transitions between <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/beginners-guide-to-enduro-racing/\">enduro racing stages</a> without having your energy sapped.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Mojo/Nicolai's radical GeoMetron machines are now available for test ride and purchase\" title=\"1447243473852-1gtqqxy01wl7r-e7152be\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Nicolai Geometron was one of the first bikes to really push geometry in the enduro segment.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>In recent years, brands such as Pole, Geometron and Alutech have pushed enduro geometries into and beyond the realms of downhill bikes, paving the way for more mainstream manufacturers to push the boat out.</p>\n<p>So, what do the numbers for enduro bikes from mainstream manufacturers tell us? Let’s look at a stalwart of the enduro scene: the Trek Slash.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The Trek Slash 9.9 29 Race Shop Limited is Mountain Biking UK's Enduro Bike of the Year for 2017\" title=\"trek-slash-29-full-2-1502993913624-i2vtts6pxktu-1503069662123-1deggmqd6y3wk-7864279\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Slash is Trek’s dedicated enduro bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Josh Patterson / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Trek Slash has undergone a steady evolution over the past five years. As head angles have rapidly slackened and bottom bracket heights dropped, reaches have grown too.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Trek Slash 9.9 X0 Eagle AXS T-Type\" title=\"Trek Slash 9.9 X0 Eagle AXS T-Type\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new Slash geometry hasn’t changed massively, with only a few adjustments to the bottom bracket height and head angle.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Sam Needham</i></span></div>\n<p>However, Trek’s amazing new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2024-trek-slash/\">Slash Gen 6</a>, with its high-pivot wizardry, comes with an 8mm greater bottom bracket height than the previous iteration. The reach has grown since the Gen 5, but only by 4mm.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the head angle is over half a degree slacker than the older model, now coming in at just 63.5 degrees.</p>\n<p>For the Slash, it seems as though the rate of change in geometry is slowing, or even reversing, in terms of reach and bottom bracket height. However, we’ve found the head angle change is certainly noticeable on the trail. Will the next Slash be even slacker, or has Trek finally hit the nail on the head?</p>\n<h2>Trail bikes</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"man riding steep terrain\" title=\"orbea occam riding pic\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Trail bikes have seen huge changes in geometry in recent years.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jérémie Reuiller</i></span></div>\n<p>With intentions set on delivering maximum fun on a variety of trails, gradients and terrain, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">trail bikes</a> are the ultimate do-it-all grin-inducers for riders who aren’t fussed about competing.</p>\n<p>Most at home at the trail centre, but still fun when riding off-piste tracks or even at the bike park, trail bikes have arguably evolved the most over the past decade.</p>\n<p>The Specialized Stumpjumper Evo broke the mould in 2018, becoming one of the most extreme mainstream trail bikes ever brought to market. But how has it evolved over the past five years? Has it got even more extreme?</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Stumpjumper EVO Elite Alloy\" title=\"Specialized Stumpjumper EVO Elite Alloy\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The current Specialized Stumpjumper EVO geometry remains very similar to the 2018 model.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd</i></span></div>\n<p>The short answer is no. In fact, the current Stumpjumper Evo has a steeper head angle (by 0.5 degrees) and a higher BB than the 2018 bike. The differences aren’t massive by any means, so Specialized was certainly onto something with the original Stumpjumper Evo. However, it is interesting to note that rather than pushing even further, the brand has decided to slightly reign in its aggressive trail bike.</p>\n<h2>What does all this mean for riders?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Male mountain biker Alex Evans riding a We Are One Arrival 152 enduro mountain bike fitted with SRAM's XX T-Type Eagle Transmission Powermeter AXS groupset\" title=\"SRAM XX T-Type Eagle Transmission Powermeter AXS groupset-8\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> We might just have reached the peak, though minor details will of course be refined.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>While there are sure to be some tweaks here and there, you can rest assured that the current MTB geometries will still work really well in five years.</p>\n<p>In short, mountain bikes are the best they’ve ever been.
