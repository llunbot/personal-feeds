While the different strata of sedimentary rock represent periods of geologic history frozen in time, accurately dating them or the fossils trapped within them has frequently proven to be frustrating.</p>\n<p>Fossilized bones and teeth have been dated with some success before, but that success is inconsistent and depends on the specimens. Both fossilization and the process of sediment turning to rock can alter the bone in ways that interfere with accuracy. While uranium-lead dating is among the most widely used methods for dating materials, it is just an emerging technology when applied to directly dating fossils.</p>\n<p>Dinosaur eggshells might have finally cracked a way to date surrounding rocks and fossils. Led by paleontologist Ryan Tucker of Stellenbosch University, a team of researchers has devised a method of dating eggshells that reveals how long ago they were covered in what was once sand, mud, or other sediments. That information will give the burial time of any other fossils embedded in the same layer of rock.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/dinosaur-eggshells-can-reveal-the-age-of-other-fossils/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/dinosaur-eggshells-can-reveal-the-age-of-other-fossils/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"47ddd9178961c8b4539d662d539419913da577b8cb6e32cd915ebf62fed9c368","category":"Tech"}
