It’ll do that, or take an existing GPX route, then run a mixed surface simulation that combines your bike, skill level, and power output to give you a recommended tire size/pressure for optimum performance. It’ll also recommend a nutrition plan and give you headwind, tailwind, and weather for the entire course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Got a race coming up that provides the route files? Plop those in and try it yourself, it’s all free to use. You can even update the surface types on your route if you have better intel than the OpenStreet map data they use.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sherpa-map-activity-racer-compares-multiple-GPX-ride-files.jpg\"><img width=\"1723\" height=\"1273\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sherpa-map-activity-racer-compares-multiple-GPX-ride-files.jpg\" alt=\"sherpa map activity racer compares multiple GPX ride files to show who is faster\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sherpa-map-activity-racer-compares-multiple-GPX-ride-files.jpg 1723w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sherpa-map-activity-racer-compares-multiple-GPX-ride-files-297x219.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sherpa-map-activity-racer-compares-multiple-GPX-ride-files-800x591.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sherpa-map-activity-racer-compares-multiple-GPX-ride-files-120x89.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sherpa-map-activity-racer-compares-multiple-GPX-ride-files-768x567.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sherpa-map-activity-racer-compares-multiple-GPX-ride-files-1536x1135.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://sherpa-map.com/activity-racer.html\" target=\"_blank\">Activity Racer</a> lets you upload a friend’s (or competitor’s) ride file and compare their performance to your own on that same course. Or upload your older files with some recent ones to see how and where you’re improving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start the virtual rides and it’ll show different color dots moving along the course so you can see where each rider is faster, who’s crushing popular segments, and what their heart rate and power output was for those segments (assuming they recorded that data and it’s in their file, of course).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All features are free as they build out the service, and it’s free to create an account. <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sherpa-map-highlights-gravel-roads-weather-for-free/\">Check our original story</a> to see more of what they’re up to.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sherpa-map-predicts-your-best-bike-setup-for-any-route/\">Sherpa Map Predicts Your Best Bike Setup for any Route</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b1cb0329d46f308a936711dedbf76726dc010f4ed8568e5638c317768303e432","category":"Cycling"}
