In <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24168733/zoom-ceo-ai-clones-digital-twins-videoconferencing-decoder-interview\">an interview</a> with The Verge's Nilay Patel published Monday, Yuan shared his plans for Zoom to become an \"AI-first company,\" using AI to automate tasks and reduce the need for human involvement in day-to-day work.</p>\n<p>\"Let’s say the team is waiting for the CEO to make a decision or maybe some meaningful conversation, my digital twin really can represent me and also can be part of the decision making process,\" Yuan said in the interview. \"We’re not there yet, but that’s a reason why there’s limitations in today’s LLMs.\"</p>\n\n<p>LLMs are <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/07/a-jargon-free-explanation-of-how-ai-large-language-models-work/\">large language models</a>—text-predicting AI models that power AI assistants like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/\">ChatGPT</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/bing-chat-is-now-microsoft-copilot-in-potentially-confusing-rebranding-move/\">Microsoft Copilot</a>. They can output very convincing human-like text based on probabilities, but they are far from being able to replicate human reasoning. Still, Yuan suggests that instead of relying on a generic LLM to impersonate you, in the future, people will train custom LLMs to simulate each person.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028754#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028754&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4ce9b21bb480af39614539ec467a6f4c30f0da2f453dd5419ae7728ea6d65a0c","category":"Tech"}
