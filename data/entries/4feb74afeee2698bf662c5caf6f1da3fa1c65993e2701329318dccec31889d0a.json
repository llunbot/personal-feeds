Shortly after it arrived in February 2024 (but after it <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/steam-next-fest-eight-game-demos-that-stood-out-from-the-crowd/\">already got its hooks into one of us</a>), some storefronts removed or re-rated the game on concerns about its cards and chips themes, causing him to <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/balatro-devs-argue-poker-roguelike-does-not-encourage-gambling-as-it-vanishes-from-some-stores\">explain his line</a> between random number generation (RNG), risk/reward mechanics, and actual gambling. He <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roguelike/i-hate-the-thought-of-balatro-becoming-a-true-gambling-game-localthunk-is-making-sure-casinos-cant-get-their-hands-on-his-game-even-after-he-dies-by-literally-writing-it-into-his-will/\">literally wrote it into his will</a> that the game cannot be used in any kind of gambling or casino property.</p>\n<p>So LocalThunk has done everything he can to ensure <em>Balatro</em> won't waste people's money. Time, though? If you're a <em>Balatro</em> fan already, or more of a mobile gamer than a console or computer player, your time is in danger.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047492#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047492&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4feb74afeee2698bf662c5caf6f1da3fa1c65993e2701329318dccec31889d0a","category":"Tech"}
