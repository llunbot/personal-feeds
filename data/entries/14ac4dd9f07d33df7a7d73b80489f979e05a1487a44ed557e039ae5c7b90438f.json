It's a desk stand that clamps on to the edge of a desk or a table, with an adjustable arm that can be tilted and angled to get the perfect viewing position.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/lululook-ipad-stand-arm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"788\" height=\"443\" />\r<br />\nAn ‌iPad‌ connects directly to the mount using magnets that hold it securely in place, while the other end clamps to a desk. There are actually 88 small magnets to ensure that your ‌iPad‌ isn't going to go anywhere. A joint on the clamp allows it to be rotated 360 degrees, and there's also another joint at the top, so it's easy to reposition.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/lululook-ipad-stand-arm-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1063\" height=\"599\" />\r<br />\nA USB-C cable provides power, and the ‌iPad‌ is able to charge through the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-connector/\">Smart Connector</a>. With the three section arm, it can be shifted around on a desk, so it's perfect for setting up an ‌iPad‌ as a second monitor, or attaching one to a worktable where you want to be able to watch video content while the ‌iPad‌ is out of your workspace. You can use it in either landscape or portrait mode. There are versions of the stand for the 13-inch 2024 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2025-ipad-air/\">2025 iPad Air</a> models, plus it works with some older iPads too, including the 2018 and later 13-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/lululook-ipad-stand-arm-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1124\" height=\"631\" />\r<br />\nLululook has plenty of other stand options too, if you don't need the clamp design. The <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FiPad-Pro-12-9-Air-13%2Fdp%2FB0DZXGHZGM%2F%3Fth%3D1\">Magnetic Wireless Charging Stand</a> for the 13-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ and Air is $90, and it has a clean, Mac-like look. It charges an ‌iPad‌ via ‌Smart Connector‌, and it has two 360-degree pivot points for adjustability. The stand is made from aluminum alloy so it has a sleek look that blends well with Apple devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/lululook-magnetic-ipad-charging-stand.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThere's also the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Magnetic-Spinning-Foldable-12-9%2Fdp%2FB0C3H3721R%2F\">$80 Magnetic iPad Stand</a> for the 13-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ and ‌iPad Air‌, which is a good option if you don't need included charging.
