Only a small number of people can view each link, and airline staff must authenticate using an Apple ID or a verified partner email to gain access.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nChina Airlines said that as soon as customers find their item, location sharing is disabled. The owner can also stop sharing their location at any time, and the sharing link automatically expires after 7 days to ensure the privacy of passengers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Apple-Share-Item-Location-iPhone-iPad-Mac.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nAmerican Airlines rolled out support for the feature in February.
