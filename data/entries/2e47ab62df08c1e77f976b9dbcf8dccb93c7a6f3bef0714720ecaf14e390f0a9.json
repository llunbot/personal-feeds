David Saunders, a World War II and Korean War veteran, died of COVID-19 on August 24 at the age of 98. Donating his body was his last act of patriotism, Elsie Saunders said.</p>\n<p>But instead of being delivered to a research facility, David Saunders' body ended up in a Marriott Hotel ballroom in Portland, Oregon, where DeathScience.org held an \"Oddities and Curiosities Expo.\" At the October 17 event, members of the public sat ringside from 9 am to 4 pm—with a break for lunch—to watch David Saunders' body be carefully dissected. Tickets for the dissection sold for up to $500 per person.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810925#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810925&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2e47ab62df08c1e77f976b9dbcf8dccb93c7a6f3bef0714720ecaf14e390f0a9","category":"Tech"}
