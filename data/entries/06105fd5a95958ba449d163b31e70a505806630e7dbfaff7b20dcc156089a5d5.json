The website claims to have obtained exclusive information suggesting that the Vision Pro will launch on Saturday, January 27 in the United States. While the report clearly says that the launch is set to occur on a date that falls on a Saturday in the United States, there is a chance that the website is actually referring to January 27 in China, which falls on Friday, January 26 in the United States â€“ a much more likely date for the launch of the Vision Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has never launched any of its hardware products on a Saturday, so it seems very unlikely that the Vision Pro headset would the first. The company likely prefers to launch products on weekdays to align with normal business hours, ensuring maximum media coverage and stock market reaction. Friday, January 26 is likely also a more accurate interpretation since Apple overwhelmingly chooses Fridays to launch its new devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple simply says that the Vision Pro headset will launch \"early\" this year and has not yet announced any specific time frame for pre-orders and the product's launch.
