The most interesting is that the Pixel 8a, Pixel 8, and Pixel 8 Pro are all getting DisplayPort Alt Mode capabilities via their USB-C ports. This means you can go from USB-C to DisplayPort and plug right into a TV or monitor. This has been <a href=\"https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1623734657996017667\">rumored forever</a> and landed in some of the <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-8-display-output-3424412/\">Android Betas</a> earlier, but now it's finally shipping out to production.</p>\n<p>The Pixel 8's initial display support is just a mirrored mode. You can either get an awkward vertical phone in the middle of your wide-screen display or turn the phone sideways and get a more reasonable layout. You could see it being useful for videos or presentations. It would be nice if it could do more.</p>\n<p>Alongside this year-plus of display port rumors has been a steady drum beat (again) for an Android desktop mode. Google has been <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/03/this-is-android-ns-freeform-window-mode/\">playing around</a> with this idea since Android 7.0 in 2016. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/07/android-qa-android-engineers-take-us-on-a-deep-dive-of-android-q/3/#:~:text=Ghuloum%3A%C2%A0I,form%20factor%20devices.\">In 2019</a>, we were told it was just a development testing project, and it never shipped to any real devices. Work around Android's desktop mode has been heating up, though, so maybe a second swing at this idea will result in an actual product.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030791#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030791&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d6492bae6d4b5cecac20cfddeed634ee557416ffe3a50c1d15b5fc039d5279d4","category":"Tech"}
