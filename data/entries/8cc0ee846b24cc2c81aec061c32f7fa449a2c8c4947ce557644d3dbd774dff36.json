In a separate incident on the same day, the system falsely claimed that Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, misinterpreting a story about a Brazilian tennis player.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThese latest mishaps follow previous concerns raised by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), which called for Apple to remove the AI summary feature last month after it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/19/apple-faces-criticism-new-notification-summaries/\">generated misleading headlines</a> about a high-profile murder case. The journalism organization warned that such AI-generated summaries pose \"a danger to the public's right to reliable information.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe BBC has demanded urgent action from Apple, claiming that the recurring issue threatens the credibility of trusted news organizations. \"It is essential that Apple fixes this problem urgently - as this has happened multiple times,\" a BBC spokesperson said.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-turn-off-notification-summaries/\">iOS Notification Summaries Lost in Translation? How to Turn Them Off</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nApple Intelligence is available on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16 models, and select iPads and Macs running iOS 18.1 or later. Amongst other things, the AI features aim to simplify notification management by condensing multiple alerts into brief summaries. The feature includes a reporting mechanism for inaccurate summaries, but Apple has not publicly addressed the ongoing concerns or disclosed the number of reports it has received.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/06/bbc-calls-out-apple-ai-creating-fake-news-titles/\">BBC Calls Out Apple's AI Feature for Creating More Fake News Headlines</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bbc-calls-out-apples-ai-feature-for-creating-more-fake-news-headlines.2446778/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8cc0ee846b24cc2c81aec061c32f7fa449a2c8c4947ce557644d3dbd774dff36","category":"Apple"}
