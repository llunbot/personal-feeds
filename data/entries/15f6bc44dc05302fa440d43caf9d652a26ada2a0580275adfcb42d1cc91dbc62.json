Raleigh says it worked closely with internal hub gear manufacturer Sturmey-Archer to replicate this feature on the 2023 Chopper.</p>\n<p>Raleigh’s managing director Lee Kidger <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-raleigh-chopper/\">explained to BikeRadar</a> that the new Chopper was designed to be as close to the original MK2 Chopper as possible. Such is the resemblance, he said enthusiasts often mistook the new version for the original.</p>\n<p>Kidger also said he hoped releasing the new Chopper would inspire people to cycle more and that Raleigh’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">electric bikes</a> would provide a practical solution to facilitate this behaviour change.</p>\n<p>The Chopper’s return led to widespread media coverage, with Kidger appearing on the BBC Breakfast TV show in the UK to explain why the brand had brought back the bike, which became a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tech/raleigh-chopper-1970s-icon/\">1970s icon</a>.</p>\n<h2>When will the second drop of Raleigh Choppers be available?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Man smiling through frame of red Raleigh Chopper.\" title=\"Raleigh Chopper\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The second release will be available from 25 July at midday.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Raleigh</i></span></div>\n<p>Raleigh says the second drop of the 2023 Chopper bike will be available on its website from 12pm (BST) on 25 July.</p>\n<p>Potential customers will be put in a queuing system and the server will randomly allocate a position to everyone on the website.</p>\n<p>Raleigh says this means waiting on the site earlier than midday does not guarantee a better position.</p>\n<p>Purchases will be restricted to one Chopper of each available colour, Ultra Violet and Infrared.
