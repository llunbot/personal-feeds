Fortunately, with the upcoming macOS 13.3 update, it appears that Apple has fixed the issue.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Ventura-Macs-Feature-Yellow.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nSeveral users who were affected by the issue have noted that network file sharing is functional again as of the third beta of macOS 13.3 and later, with one user saying that Apple confirmed a fix was implemented. macOS 13.3 is in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/21/apple-seeds-macos-ventura-13-3-release-candidate/\">final stages of beta testing</a> and is expected to be publicly released as soon as next week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUsers complained about macOS 13.2 breaking network file sharing across the <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ventura-today-13-2-file-sharing-now-quit.2378064/\">MacRumors Forums</a>, <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254588815\">Apple Support Community</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/10k7070/ventura_132_cannot_connect_with_smb/\">Reddit</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maddisondesigns/status/1632662619768381440\">Twitter</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFile Sharing can be enabled in System Settings → General → Sharing and allows for a Mac's files to be accessed remotely over a local network. For example, a user may have a Mac mini set up as a server and enable File Sharing on that computer in order to remotely access files from their primary computer, such as a MacBook Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks, Todd Willbur!)</em><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-13/\">macOS Ventura</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-ventura.239\">macOS Ventura</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/23/macos-13-3-fixes-network-file-sharing/\">macOS 13.3 Coming Soon With Fix for Network File Sharing</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-13-3-coming-soon-with-fix-for-network-file-sharing.2384572/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"26d762e972fe16a78a39d7a619842252dcf53abdc6c0cd28bc8ecc384bdc7dda","category":"Apple"}
