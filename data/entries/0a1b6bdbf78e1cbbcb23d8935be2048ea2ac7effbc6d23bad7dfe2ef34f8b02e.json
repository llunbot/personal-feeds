It's unclear when the update will be released, but it will likely be available within the next week or two.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/iOS-16.4.1-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nLike other minor updates, iOS 16.4.1 will likely be focused on bug fixes and/or security patches. Since iOS 16.4 was released last week, some iPhone users have complained about being forced to re-enter Wi-Fi passwords occasionally, and various user interface glitches. Some users continue to complain about <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/04/weather-app-forecast-data-not-loading/\">Weather app data failing to display</a> too, despite Apple's system status page indicating that issue is now resolved.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 16.4.1 will be a stopgap until iOS 16.5 is released around May. Apple seeded the first beta of iOS 16.5 last week with a few minor changes, including a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/28/apple-news-app-sports-tab-ios-16-5/\">Sports tab in the Apple News app</a> and the ability to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/28/ios-16-5-siri-screen-recording/\">start a screen recording with Siri</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce iOS 17 during the WWDC 2023 keynote <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/29/apple-announces-wwdc-2023/\">on June 5</a>, so the iOS 16 software cycle is nearing its completion.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/\">iOS 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-16/\">iPadOS 16</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-16.238\">iOS 16</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/05/apple-testing-ios-16-4-1/\">Apple Now Testing iOS 16.4.1 for iPhone With Bug Fixes Expected</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-testing-ios-16-4-1-for-iphone-with-bug-fixes-expected.2386009/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0a1b6bdbf78e1cbbcb23d8935be2048ea2ac7effbc6d23bad7dfe2ef34f8b02e","category":"Apple"}
