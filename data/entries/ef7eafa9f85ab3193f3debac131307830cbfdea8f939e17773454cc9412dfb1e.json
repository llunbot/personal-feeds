Before you know it, the whole family will be out enjoying life on two wheels.</p>\n<h2>How to choose the right size bike for your child</h2>\n<p>The most important factors to consider when choosing a bike for your child are height and ability.</p>\n<p>The weight of the bike will also affect its handling, and bikes at the very low end of the price spectrum are often the heaviest.</p>\n<p>If you already know what size bike to go for, scroll down to see our suggestions for children of each age group.</p>\n<h3>Why it’s important to get the right size</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s more to sizing kids’ bikes than simply frame size.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Woom</i></span></div>\n<p>Kids grow remarkably fast, and no one knows that better than their parents!</p>\n<p>While it might be tempting to buy a bike that’s a little too large for your child for them to ‘grow into’, this can actually hamper the learning process and make it much harder for them.</p>\n<p>Riding a bike that’s too big can not only make it more difficult to manoeuvre, but it can also really take the fun out of the process. If you want your child’s first memories of cycling to be positive and enjoyable, then making sure you find a bike that’s the perfect size for them at their current measurements is really key.</p>\n<h3>How bikes differ in size</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Kids’ bikes range widely in wheel size. Getting the right one matters.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ben Delaney / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>There are two ways in which children’s bikes differ in size: the wheels and the frame. These two major elements increase in size, in tandem, as the child grows. However, unlike adult bikes, kids’ bikes are typically measured and sold by wheel size.</p>\n<p>The smallest wheels you’re likely to find are tiny 12-inch wheels on balance bikes, and they then go up to 26 inches for some bikes designed for teenagers. Sizes typically increase in two-inch increments. The frames are designed with geometry to accommodate the increasing wheel size as children grow.</p>\n<p>On smaller frames, you’ll find correspondingly reduced-size components too, from smaller, adjustable-reach brake levers to shorter cranks.</p>\n<p>Check out our guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/guide-to-kids-bike-wheel-sizes/\">kids’ bike wheel sizes</a> for more help on what size bike to choose.</p>\n<h3>How to choose the right size bike</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Most bike brands will offer comprehensive guides to help you find the right size for your child.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Woom </i></span></div>\n<p>You can pretty much disregard the age of your child when it comes to choosing the right size bike: height and inseam length are much more important, as kids grow at such varying rates.</p>\n<p>You’ll find that most brands offer size guides for helping you to choose the best-sized bike. For example, Woom and Islabikes both offer inseam charts, accompanied by tips for measuring your child.</p>\n<p>When it comes to sitting your child on the bike that you’re looking to buy, you need to make sure that they can reach both feet on the ground while sitting on the saddle.</p>\n<p>This is not only important for giving a good pedalling position, but also allows the child to stop and put their feet down when they want to.</p>\n<p>The second element of the fit is the reach. You need to make sure that they can not only comfortably reach the handlebars with both hands, but also the brake levers – and be able to operate these easily. Some bikes will be built with adjustable-reach brake levers, so check for these.</p>\n<h3>What if your child is in between sizes?</h3>\n<p>Again, as tempting as it might be to size up like you might with school uniform or shoes, it’s usually best here to choose the smaller size. Why is that?</p>\n<p>Well, a larger bike will typically be harder for a child to steer, stop and start, especially where they might need to stand on their tiptoes to reach the floor. This larger bike might feel more intimidating and less comfortable, especially for less confident riders.</p>\n<p>As the feelings of control, security and confidence are key to an enjoyable cycling experience for kids, it’s clear to see why a smaller bike is likely to offer a better experience here if you’re unsure between sizes.</p>\n<p>The exception to this guidance would be that if the child is really on the cusp of the larger size, it might be a better idea because they’ll be able to enjoy riding it for much longer, as well as have a more efficient pedal stroke on the larger bike.</p>\n<h3>How long until a child outgrows their bike?</h3>\n<p>Of course no two children are the same or grow at the same rates, but some brands suggest that their bikes last an average of two years before it’s outgrown. This is if it’s purchased when the child fits in the lower end of the sizing bracket.</p>\n<p>This might not seem like long at all, but thankfully many of these quality children’s bikes hold excellent resale value. Some brands also offer trade-in schemes when you purchase a larger-sized bike.</p>\n<h3>How a child’s cycling skill can affect size</h3>\n<p>Interestingly, it’s not only your child’s measurements that can dictate which size will be best for them. Their skill level also has a bearing on what size and weight of bike will be best.</p>\n<p>A less confident or less skilled child might really benefit from a slightly smaller, more lightweight bicycle. This is because they tend to be easier for the child to handle and manoeuvre, as well as to get onto and dismount.</p>\n<p>Having said this, the most key part will still be getting the basic fit right, again for your child’s physical size, rather than age.</p>\n<h2>Balance bike vs pedal bike</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> After a new bike for your child but not sure where to start? Let us help!</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy</i></span></div>\n<p>First things first, when it comes to kids’ bikes, what’s on offer?</p>\n<p>You might be thinking it’s just a shrunken-down adult bike, but in reality it’s a little different. There’s a lot to consider when buying a kids’ bike but, broadly speaking, let’s start with the two main options: a balance bike and a pedal bike.</p>\n<p>Balance bikes have become really popular over recent years as a child’s first bike, and with good reason too, which we’ll come on to later. Alternatively, there’s the more traditional approach of small pedal bikes, often fitted with removable stabilisers.</p>\n<p>Children’s bikes tend to feature flat bars rather than the drop bars we’re used to seeing on road bikes, especially for younger ages. As they grow, you are likely to find more choice, including rigid and suspension bikes, with hybrids and hardtails on offer.</p>\n<p>The first stages of teaching a child how to ride a bike are really crucial, and the balance bike has been something of a revelation for many keen parents – not to mention kids.</p>\n<p>These simple little bikes don’t feature pedals, and some don’t have a brake either. The clue is in the name: a balance bike teaches the child fundamental balancing skills, which they simply don’t get by riding a pedal bike fitted with stabilisers.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Balance bikes are great for learning how to ride.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oli Woodman / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>In fact, the technique for cornering a bike with or without stabilisers is really quite different, as these effectively turn the bike into a tricycle, so starting out with stabilisers can actually complicate, rather than aid, the learning process.</p>\n<p>By learning on a balance bike, kids can master balance, steering and sometimes braking techniques from the very start, which they can then build on when it comes to upgrading to their first pedal bike, and adding the challenge of pedalling.</p>\n<p>Balance bikes are great for children from as soon as they start walking to around four years old, although the time to switch to a pedal bike will vary according to the child’s capability.</p>\n<p>Some will take a little longer to grasp these early skills and others will pick them up much faster.</p>\n<h2>The best kids’ bikes in 2021</h2>\n<h3>Ages 4 to 6</h3>\n<p>For children aged four to six, measuring around 105cm to 115cm / 3ft 5in to 3ft 9in, go for a bike with 14in to 16in wheels. Most of these are simple bikes with pedals and brakes, and many come with a small range of gears.</p>\n<h3>Ages 7 to 10</h3>\n<p>For ages seven to 10 (height 115cm to 135cm / 3ft 9in to 4ft 5in), choose a bike with 18in to 20in wheels. You’ll also start to see a wider range of gears appearing at this price point, and you may find bikes with front suspension, which are more suitable for rough terrain.</p>\n<h3>Ages 10 to 13</h3>\n<p>Children aged between 10 and 13 (height 135cm to 150cm / 4ft 5in to 5ft) will usually move on to a 24in-wheel bike and, at this point, you’ll find bikes that are essentially a smaller version of an adult bike.</p>\n<p>You’ll also start to see different types of bike, from junior-sized road bikes and mountain bikes to hybrid/leisure bikes. Choose a bike type that’s going to suit the majority of the riding your child will be doing – if it’s mostly going to be off-road, wide tyres with a grippy tread are a good choice, for example.</p>\n<h3>Teenagers</h3>\n<p>For teenagers, you’re going to be looking at adult bikes in smaller sizes. There are smaller wheel-size options for junior road bikes, such as 650b, but most bikes will have 26in, 27.5in or 700c wheels.</p>\n<p>Bear in mind that these sizes are a guideline only. If your teen is taller or smaller than average, or more or less confident, they may be better off on a different size. If in doubt, talk to your local bike shop.</p>\n<h2>How to teach a child to ride a bike</h2>\n<p>Need to teach a child how to ride? We’ve got a separate guide on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/how-to-teach-a-child-to-cycle-in-30-minutes/\">how to teach a child to ride a bike</a> in only 30 minutes. Or just watch the video tutorial below.</p>\n<p>We’ve also got a guide on <a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/beginners/gear/article/how-to-teach-a-kid-to-ride-using-a-balance-bike-42867/\">how to teach a child to ride a balance bike</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Best bikes and balance bikes for ages 1 to 4</h2>\n<p>Your child has just started walking and you’re keen to make the transition to the bike for your budding rider as natural as possible. Enter stage left, the balance bike.</p>\n<p>Weight is a surprisingly important factor here.</p>\n<p>No, your kid’s not looking to get airtime or take on a hill climb race just yet – but compared to a toddler, the weight of a bike is really significant. The lighter you can afford within your budget, the better, as this is likely to make it much easier for your child, and hence more enjoyable.</p>\n<p>Although some more basic balance bikes won’t be fitted with a brake, it’s a good idea to look for one that does. Your child can learn this important skill in the early stages, before moving on to a pedal bike. This is especially important if your local playground or park is a bit hilly.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Balance bikes are generally accepted as the best way to teach young children to ride.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>Balance bikes that have an easily adjustable seatpost can also be a good idea, as this can be adapted as they grow.</p>\n<p>Finally, look for a balance bike that’s made to last. Dragged through the mud, splashed through puddles and maybe even left out in the rain: you want a bike that’ll stand up to the rigous of heavy use and still be in good condition to pass on or sell after. Alloy bikes tend to last better than wooden-style balance bikes.</p>\n<p>There are also some pedal-powered options for two- to four-year-olds, and many will come with brakes – either lever-operated ones or coaster brakes that work by back-pedalling, and sometimes both.</p>\n<h2>Woom 1</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The red Woom 1 balance bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Woom</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>€189 / $199</li>\n</ul><p>Kids’ bike specialists Woom’s first offering is this 2.95kg balance bike, the Woom 1.

Your kid is zipping about in front of you, flinging legs to gain speed, cornering with confidence and effectively braking. It’s just the time to think about adding the next element into the mix: pedalling.</p>\n<p>Moving from a balance bike to a pedal bike is a really crucial step, and fit is key here.</p>\n<p>You need to make sure that your child can comfortably reach the floor with their feet when seated in the saddle, as well as reaching the handlebars and crucially the brake levers.</p>\n<p>To keep it simple, your child’s first pedal bike might only have a single, or couple of gears to choose from. Once they’ve mastered the art of pedalling, they can move on to having many more gears as they grow and size up to bigger bikes.</p>\n<p>Just like with a balance bike, having a lightweight option here is also really helpful, as your child is likely to still be very small.</p>\n<p>The riding position is best if it is relatively upright. As they get to grips with pedalling, this will help them focus on what’s going on around them.</p>\n<p>These bikes typically measure up with 14in or 16in wheels. If the bike was already supplied with stabilisers, and your child is confident riding without them, then remove them ASAP.</p>\n<p>Most kids’ bikes in this price bracket should allow you to adjust the reach to the brakes. Many also have coaster brakes rather than lever-operated brakes, which are operated by back-pedalling.</p>\n<h2>Early Rider Belter 16in</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Early Rider Belter 16 is ideal for riders aged between 4 and 6.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Early Rider</i></span></div>\n<ul><li> £359 / $439</li>\n</ul><p>The 5.9kg Belter from Early Rider is a fantastic first pedal bike.</p>\n<p>Early Rider has chosen to spec a Gates rubber belt where you’d normally find a chain.

In the early stages, kids’ bikes tend to be rigid, flat-bar bikes, from balance bikes through to early pedal cycles. Off-road bikes with wider tyres and potentially a suspension fork comes later, as do drop-bar road bikes.</p>\n<p>What’s essential is getting the fundamental skills mastered in the early stages, rather than trying to specialise into any particular cycling discipline yet.</p>\n<h3>Should you buy a bike with suspension?</h3>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> In most cases, you’re best off avoiding suspension on smaller bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Go Outdoors</i></span></div>\n<p>Thinking of looking for a bike with suspension for your budding shredder? In short, don’t. For really young children, when inflated to the correct pressures, tyres can provide all the suspension they need.</p>\n<p>For children of a really young age and small size, suspension forks not only make the bike much heavier, and therefore harder to handle, but can also be a lot more expensive.</p>\n<p>It’s much better to opt for a rigid bike with good brakes and wider tyres, leaving the added complication of suspension for when they’ve grown a little and mastered the fundamentals without it.</p>\n<h3>Weight</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The smaller the child, the more important bike weight becomes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Black Mountain</i></span></div>\n<p>Bike weight is something we’ve mentioned already, but it’s worth emphasing again.</p>\n<p>Because children are much lighter than adults, their bike’s comparative weight becomes really important, and has a big effect on how easy the bike is to ride and handle.</p>\n<p>It’s a good idea to choose the lightest bike that you can afford within your budget at the optimum size for your child. This should make the whole process more enjoyable for your young cyclist, and for you too!</p>\n<h3>Gears and brakes</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The larger the bike, the more gears they tend to feature.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>Don’t be surprised if the bikes you’re looking at don’t feature many gears – this doesn’t mean bad value for money. These are typically reserved for larger kids’ bikes, and hence older children, so that there are only one or two new things to concentrate on learning for each new bike size.</p>\n<p>Many first pedal bikes will be either singlespeed or only feature a few gears. As they increase in size, you’ll find 8-speed cassettes and single chainring options, for example.</p>\n<p>As well as keeping things simple in the early stages, limiting the gears also helps to keep bikes lightweight. As a child grows in both size and ability, gears become more important for longer rides, where they’re more likely to encounter a hill or two.</p>\n<p>You’re likely to find either rim or disc brakes, with levers on the handlebars. You might even find a pedal brake, or coaster brake, which is a legal requirement for kids’ bikes with a maximum seat height of 25in or less that are sold in the US.</p>\n<p>While coaster brakes, which are applied by backpedalling, are often thought to be easier for children to use, causing fewer accidents due to harsh braking, they don’t give quite as much control as rim or disc brakes, especially when it comes to riding off-road.</p>\n<p>On the handlebars, the brakes are not only smaller than adults’ bikes, but also feature adjustable brake levers so you can reduce the reach for smaller hands. Gear shifting is often through a grip shifter, which can take less strength to shift.</p>\n<h3>Protection</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There are loads of fun designs to choose from when it comes to kids’ lids.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ben Delaney / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>While you’re shopping for your child’s first bike, it’s also a really good idea to check out the protection on offer. A helmet is crucial here, and it needs to be well-fitting to be safe. Make sure that it doesn’t move around at all when fitted before you buy.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-kids-bike-helmets-a-buyers-guide/\">buyer’s guide to kids’ helmets</a> offers a few recommendations, as well as help to ensure you get a well-fitting helmet for your child.</p>\n<p>For children just getting to grips with riding, it might be a good idea to invest in some knee and elbow pads too, which can help avoid the almost inevitable bumps and scrapes that come with learning how to ride.</p>\n<p>One final point worth mentioning – many kids’ bikes come with a chainguard and that’s often useful to keep little hands clean and safe.</p>\n<h2>Over to you</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Start ’em young and share the joy of riding a bike!</span></figcaption><span> <i>Woom</i></span></div>\n<p>And there you have it – everything you need to know about buying a kids’ bike.</p>\n<p>There’s quite a lot to think about when choosing a bike for a child, but essentially the most crucial parts are getting the size right, and making sure your little cyclist feels comfortable, safe and confident in the saddle.</p>\n<p>A fun and happy learning experience is key to building a hobby that a kid will keep coming back to. It will also ensure that you really get your money’s worth from your investment, rather than the bike simply getting relegated to the shed and forgotten about!</p>\n<p>Finally, if you are considering doing the school or nursery run by bike, we have plenty of advice for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/handy-tips-for-commuting-with-kids/\">commuting with kids</a>.</p>","author":"Oli Woodman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"ef7eafa9f85ab3193f3debac131307830cbfdea8f939e17773454cc9412dfb1e","category":"Cycling"}
