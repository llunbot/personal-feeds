The \"Ecobee Smart Thermostat\" (Model # : EB-STAT-02) and the Ecobee Energy Management System (EMS) business thermostat (Model #: EB-EMS-02) are <a href=\"https://support.ecobee.com/s/articles/Connectivity-and-Support-for-Legacy-Products\">losing web access</a> on July 31, 2024. Every Ecobee device has nearly the same name, but these are older devices. Ecobee says these will still function as local thermostats after the shutdown, but \"any features requiring connectivity to the Ecobee servers, such as control from the Ecobee Web Portal, weather information, integrations etc, will no longer function.\"</p>\n<p>The EB-STAT-02 was \"the <a href=\"https://smartthermostatguide.com/ecobee-eb-stat-02-smart-thermostat-review/\">worldâ€™s first Wi-Fi enabled thermostat</a>\" when it launched in 2008, and sales ended in 2013. Unlike the current Ecobees, this is a white rectangle that connected to a giant \"<a href=\"https://www.ontimemall.com/ecobee-ebstat02-wireless-internet-thermostat.html\">equipment interface module</a>\" box you needed to hide in your HVAC system somewhere. The wall-mounted controller used an old-even-in-2009 <em>resistive</em> touchscreen, was an inch thick, and had a colorful interface that looked a lot like early versions of iOS. Most of the basics were here though, with an app that mimicked the wall controller interface, over-the-Internet control, a web portal, and access to lots of data. The EB-EMS-02 launched two years later as a commercial version of the Stat 02 and needed a subscription fee to work.</p>\n<p>As you'd expect from an old Internet-connected device, the Wi-Fi support of the Stat 02 is pretty bad nowadays. According to <a href=\"https://support.ecobee.com/s/articles/ecobee-smart-installation-and-setup-guide\">Ecobee's support page</a>, it only supported 802.11b/g for Wi-Fi (that would be \"Wi-Fi 3\" under the current naming scheme). Encryption went up to WPA2, and even with firmware updates, you <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/04/serious-flaws-leave-wpa3-vulnerable-to-hacks-that-steal-wi-fi-passwords/\">have to</a> <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/10/severe-flaw-in-wpa2-protocol-leaves-wi-fi-traffic-open-to-eavesdropping/\">start</a> <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/farewell-to-firewalls-wi-fi-bugs-open-network-devices-to-remote-hacks/\">questioning</a> the security of a 16-year-old Internet-connected device. Not relying on the cloud would be nice, but at some point, you just have to throw this stuff out.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021683#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021683&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e7c42557c172579b153a8c637a7111dae1aff573d7b36a0052854aa5978126b4","category":"Tech"}
