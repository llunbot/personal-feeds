The functionality of the app &amp; website is better than ever with recent features such as <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ride-with-gps-quicknav-navigation-app-directions-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">QuickNav</a>. Those improvements have made a Ride with GPS subscription more useful than ever – and those subscriptions are on sale once again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the only discount they run during the year, which means if you plan on paying for a Premium RwGPS account, now is the time. Available until January 2nd, RwGPS is offering 15 months of premium for the price of 12. That means you’re paying $79.99 for 15 months, which works out to a 25% discount. As a bonus, BikeRumor will get a small percentage of that discount as well – so you can help find your way and help us continue to provide great content!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could <a href=\"https://ridewithgps.com/gifts\">purchase the plan for yourself, or give it as a gift</a>. The subscription can be redeemed any time in the future, and if you choose to gift the subscription, you can choose the delivery date when it will be delivered via email. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time to start planning those rides in the new year! Follow the link below to redeem the offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ridewithgps.com/gifts?giveback=BikeRumor\" target=\"_blank\"><em>ridewithgps.com</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ride-with-gps-premium-subscription-black-friday-holiday-gift-sale-promo/\">Ride with GPS Three Free Months of Premium Promo is Back and Supports BikeRumor!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"0765bdb523f039ae9cd06d882858510b94199c0efdf45492c0c23ff5d63a5b93","category":"Cycling"}
