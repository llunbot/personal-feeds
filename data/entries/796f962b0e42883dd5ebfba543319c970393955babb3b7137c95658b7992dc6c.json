These bare-bones GPUs won't play many games, as we found <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/ryzen-7600x-and-7950x-review-zen-4-starts-off-expensive-but-impressive/5/#h2\">when we tested them</a>, but they're a reliable way to light up a couple of monitors.</p>\n<p>AMD said at the time that it also planned to continue making desktop APUs, the company's longstanding terminology for a Ryzen CPU paired with a more powerful integrated Radeon GPU, but we haven't heard anything about a new Ryzen desktop APU since. That could be changing early next year, according to the release notes for <a href=\"https://www.gigabyte.com/Press/News/2123\">a slew of BIOS updates for Gigabyte motherboards</a>. According to Gigabyte, a new series of APUs for socket AM5 motherboards will be released starting in January 2024, and they'll be compatible with any current socket AM5 motherboard running version 1.1.0.0 or newer of AMD's AGESA firmware.</p>\n<p>Tom's Hardware has <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/gigabyte-releases-Ryzen-8000G-supporting-BIOS\">a breakdown</a> of the Ryzen 8000G series, purportedly gleaned from this new AGESA version. According to this, the chips will be named the Ryzen 8000G series, and they'll use the same \"Phoenix\" silicon that AMD uses in its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/amd-is-ready-to-launch-its-twice-delayed-ryzen-7000-chips-for-lightweight-laptops/\">Ryzen 7040U laptop processors</a> and the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/amds-ryzen-z1-chips-could-power-a-new-wave-of-handheld-steam-deck-clones/\">Ryzen Z1 series</a> of chips for gaming handhelds.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983286#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983286&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"796f962b0e42883dd5ebfba543319c970393955babb3b7137c95658b7992dc6c","category":"Tech"}
