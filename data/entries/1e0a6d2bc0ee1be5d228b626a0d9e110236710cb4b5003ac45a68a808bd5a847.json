Named in honor of famous Autobot leader Optimus Prime, Prime Day is the international day of celebration where we—wait, they're telling me that Prime Day is in fact <em>not</em> named after famous Autobot leader Optimus Prime and is in fact <em>not</em> an international day of celebration. Well, if that's the case, then what the hell am I going to do with this gigantic Optimus Prime costume I spent all week making? I've got a whole list of Optimus Prime-related activities we were going to do! I brought craft supplies! We were going to make little macramé trucks!</p>\n<p>This has really taken the wind out of my sails, ugh. While I figure out what to do with an overwhelming amount of Transformers party supplies, maybe you folks can pull up your chairs, pull out your wallets, and peruse the Amazon Prime Day deals below (which are, I am assured, the best deals the commerce team could sniff out). Because if we can't celebrate Prime Day by cosplaying as our favorite Transformers characters, maybe we can still hold onto the spirit of the day by buying a whole bunch of stuff on sale! Retail therapy for everyone! It's what Optimus would have wanted!</p>\n<p>(A note on pricing: We've confirmed the prices on all the items below are accurate as of the publication time of this article. However, much like Megatron's evil schemes, Prime Day pricing is mutable and constantly changing. Make sure to verify the price on what you want to buy before you buy it!)</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/10/ars-prime-day-2024-techstravaganza-the-best-deals-on-the-best-things/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/10/ars-prime-day-2024-techstravaganza-the-best-deals-on-the-best-things/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Lee Hutchinson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1e0a6d2bc0ee1be5d228b626a0d9e110236710cb4b5003ac45a68a808bd5a847","category":"Tech"}
