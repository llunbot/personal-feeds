It’s also larger than the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hammerhead-karoo-3\" target=\"_blank\">Hammerhead Karoo</a>, but with the same high 480×800-pixel resolution. It has an on-board Sim slot for wireless data and is priced at €570. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Easy-to-read data display</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-2-970x646.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-2-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-2-2048x1364.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-2-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-2-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Jespr </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Jespr claims that its cycling computer offers a unique interface that’s designed to be easily read when riding. Integrated mobile data via an in-device Sim means that you don’t need to bring your phone along for connected features. This used to be the case for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/hammerhead-karoo-2-review\" target=\"_blank\">Hammerhead Karoo 2 </a>as well, but the Sim slot isn’t present in the new Karoo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other features of the Jespr computer, which are now standard in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-computers-gps-computers-for-training-navigation-and-data\" target=\"_blank\">best bike computers</a>, include climb detection, navigation and re-routing. You can view route topology, so you can see the ups and downs on your route and Jespr includes wind speed and direction info on its home screen, so you’ll know if you’ll be <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-cycle-in-headwinds\" target=\"_blank\">riding into a headwind</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It offers multiple display modes, including a training mode with power-focussed metrics and a race mode with data kept to a minimum so that you can see your key ride stats. Race mode includes a display of key course milestones such as major climbs and feed zones too, emulating the race info that the pros stick to their stems.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n

features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can choose multiple bike profiles, with the data and route options displayed tailored to your ride needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As usual, you can hook up to peripheral measurement devices, including a<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/heart-rate-training-get-with-the-beat\" target=\"_blank\"> heart rate monitor</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/best-power-meters-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">power meter</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/garmin-varia-rtl515-rear-light-review\" target=\"_blank\">rearview radar</a> via both ANT+ and BLE. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jespr says that it can also derive an estimate of live power data from other measurements, allowing you to see your power data even if you don’t ride with a power meter. It’s something that <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/strava-how-to-use\" target=\"_blank\">Strava </a>estimates too, although only post-ride and not in real time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s the usual connectivity to Strava, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-use-komoot\" target=\"_blank\">Komoot </a>and other <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-cycling-training-apps\" target=\"_blank\">training apps</a>, as well as Jespr’s own platform, which offers wireless route and workout synchronisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of size, the Jespr computer is 25×69.5x122mm and is said to weigh 180g. That’s a little larger than the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/garmin-edge-1040-solar-gps-bike-computer-review\" target=\"_blank\">Garmin Edge 1040</a>, which is 20×59.3×117.6mm with a claimed 133g weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jespr says that its computer’s thickness is designed to match that of many handlebars, so that it’s aerodynamic. It connects to the bike with a standard Garmin-style quarter-turn mount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The display is a 4-inch diagonal touchscreen with 480×800-pixel resolution and there are also buttons at the bottom of the unit’s front face, positioned similarly to those on the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/wahoo-elemnt-roam-review\" target=\"_blank\">Wahoo Elemnt </a>computers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jespr claims a runtime of seven hours, with micro-USB charging rather than the now more normal USB-C. The Jespr computer’s runtime is a little lower than the competition, with Hammerhead increasing its claimed battery life from eight hours for the Karoo 2 to over 15 hours with its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hammerhead-karoo-3\" target=\"_blank\">latest update </a>in May 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-1-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Jespr-cycling-computer-1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Jespr </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The screen size is significantly larger than the Garmin Edge 1040, which has a 3.5-inch screen and the Hammerhead Karoo at 3.2 inches, while the screen resolution matches the Karoo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The device uses the GPS, Glonass, Galileo and BeiDou satellite constellations. Display languages are German or English. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Jespr cycling computer is available from the brand’s website and is priced at €570 in Europe. Jespr is offering a data plan with the device to its first customers, which is free until the end of 2025.
