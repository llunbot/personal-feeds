Citrix disclosed the vulnerability and issued a patch on October 10. Comcast didn't patch its network until October 16 at the earliest and October 19 at the latest, a lapse of six to nine days. On October 18, researchers reported that the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-4966 and by the name Citrix Bleed, had been under <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/10/the-latest-high-severity-citrix-vulnerability-under-attack-isnt-easy-to-fix/\">active exploitation</a> since August.</p>\n<p>“However, we subsequently discovered that prior to mitigation, between October 16 and October 19, 2023, there was unauthorized access to some of our internal systems that we concluded was a result of this vulnerability,” an <a href=\"https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/49e711c6-e27c-4340-867c-9a529ab3ca2c/b2edd967-0331-4ac6-a37e-cc846cf50bb7/document.html\">accompanying notice</a> stated. “We notified federal law enforcement and conducted an investigation into the nature and scope of the incident.
