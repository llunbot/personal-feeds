He would place 47<sup>th</sup> on the day.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8632/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-tour-de-france-2021\">How to watch and live stream the Tour de France 2021</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1755/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2021: Everything you need to know</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nTwice a solo winner already this year, Matej Mohoric was clearly still smarting from his efforts on Stage 19, his eventual 140<sup>th</sup> place testament to just how much the day before had cost him.</p>\n<p>Rather than yellow or the rainbow stripes, Julian Alaphilippe was in his normal Deceuninck-QuickStep skinsuit for once, reminding us of his integral role in the Wolf Pack on his way to 19<sup>th</sup>, 2:05 off the best time of the day.</p>\n<p>Remember when we were talking about <a href=\"/tags/wout-van-aert\">Wout van Aert</a> playing second fiddle to Mathieu van der Poel in the battle of the ridiculously talented ‘Vans’?</p>\n<p>Well, Van der Poel may have won the battle with his yellow jersey-grabbing win on Stage 2, but Wout won the war, first by winning the Ventoux stage and then following up with an effort against the clock that nobody could match yesterday – a pair of stage wins leaving <a href=\"/tags/jumbo-visma\" target=\"_blank\">Jumbo-Visma</a>’s Tour return looking decidedly healthy despite Primoz Roglic’s disappointing withdrawal mid-race.</p>\n<p>Sepp Kuss’s stage win in Andorra certainly helped, but the real silver lining for the team has been the rise of Jonas Vingegaard, who took an excellent third on the day to cement his second place overall.</p>\n<p>Then there was Tadej. We’ve dished out no shortage of praise for <a href=\"/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogacar</a> during the 2021 Tour de France but for once he wasn’t up to the task yesterday, finishing a modest eighth on the day. We supect he’ll still be more than satisfied with his 5:20 lead over Vingegaard going into today’s final run to Paris.</p>\n<p>Here are Cyclist photographer Chris Auld’s photos from Stage 20:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9896/tour-de-france-2021-stage-20-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 42</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/tour_de_france_2021_stage_20_01.jpg?itok=evKpgOZa\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 1 of </span>42</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/9896/tour-de-france-2021-stage-20-gallery\">Tour de France 2021 Stage 20 gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/authors/chris-auld\">Chris Auld</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>18 Jul 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9896%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-20-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Tour%20de%20France%202021%20Stage%2020%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9896%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-20-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Tour%20de%20France%202021%20Stage%2020%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9896%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-20-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Tour%20de%20France%202021%20Stage%2020%20gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9896%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-20-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9896/tour-de-france-2021-stage-20-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 42</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/tour_de_france_2021_stage_20_01.jpg?itok=evKpgOZa\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"30e8c9015eabefacb424bd70835e434bf131d0524b221349162d48813dbfc621","category":"Cycling"}
