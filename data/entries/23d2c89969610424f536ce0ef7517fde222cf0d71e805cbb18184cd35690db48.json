After years of painstaking restoration costing around $740 million, the cathedral reopens to the public this weekend. The December issue of National Geographic features <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/notre-dame-cathedral-restoration-reopening\">an exclusive look</a> inside the restored cathedral, accompanied by striking photographs by Paris-based photographer and visual artist Tomas van Houtryve.</p>\n<p>For several hours, it seemed as if the flames would utterly destroy the 800-year-old cathedral. But after a long night of work by more than 400 Paris firefighters, the fire finally began to cool and attention began to shift to what could be salvaged and rebuilt. French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to restore Notre Dame to its former glory and set a five-year deadline. The COVID-19 pandemic caused some delays, but France nearly met that deadline regardless.</p>\n<p>Those reconstruction efforts were helped by the fact that, a few years before the fire, scientist <a href=\"https://www.sah.org/publications-and-research/sah-newsletter/sah-newsletter-ind/2018/12/06/obituary-prof.-andrew-j.-tallon-1969-2018\">Andrew Tallon</a> had used laser scanning to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/04/laser-scans-could-help-rebuild-notre-dame-cathedral/587230/\">create precisely detailed maps</a> of the interior and exterior of the cathedralâ€”an invaluable aid as Paris rebuilds this landmark structure. French acousticians had also made detailed measurements of Notre Dame's \"soundscape\" that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/05/acoustic-maps-of-notre-dame-could-help-recreate-the-cathedrals-soundscape/\">were instrumental</a> in helping architects factor acoustics into their reconstruction plans. The resulting model even enabled Brian FG Katz, research director of the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) at Sorbonne University, to create a <a href=\"https://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/1.4987161?dm_i=3Q4Y,KLEO,J2QTD,286II,1\">virtual reality version</a> of Notre Dame with all the acoustical parameters in place.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/a-peek-inside-the-restoration-of-the-iconic-notre-dame-cathedral/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/a-peek-inside-the-restoration-of-the-iconic-notre-dame-cathedral/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"23d2c89969610424f536ce0ef7517fde222cf0d71e805cbb18184cd35690db48","category":"Tech"}
