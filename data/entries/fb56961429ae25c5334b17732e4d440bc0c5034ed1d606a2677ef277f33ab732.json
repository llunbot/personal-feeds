Intuit \"engaged in deceptive advertising in violation of the FTC Act and deceived consumers when it ran ads for 'free' tax products and services for which many consumers were ineligible,\" the FTC said in an <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/01/ftc-issues-opinion-finding-turbotax-maker-intuit-inc-engaged-deceptive-practices\">announcement</a> of its decision.</p>\n<p>FTC commissioners voted 3–0 to issue a final order that upholds a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/ftc-judge-rules-intuit-broke-law-must-stop-advertising-turbotax-as-free/\">September 2023 ruling</a> against Intuit by the FTC's chief administrative law judge.</p>\n<p>\"The <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/d09408_commission_final_order.pdf\">Commission's Final Order</a> prohibits Intuit from advertising or marketing that any good or service is free unless it is free for all consumers or it discloses clearly and conspicuously and in close proximity to the 'free' claim the percentage of taxpayers or consumers that qualify for the free product or service. Alternatively, if the good or service is not free for a majority of consumers, it could disclose that a majority of consumers do not qualify,\" the FTC said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998179#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998179&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fb56961429ae25c5334b17732e4d440bc0c5034ed1d606a2677ef277f33ab732","category":"Tech"}
