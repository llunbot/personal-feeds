Once the OS is finished, Apple needs to send it off to the factories to be installed on the new hardware. That process could last a couple weeks, probably taking us deeper into next month.</blockquote>Young expects Apple to announce the new iPad Pro models in \"late March or early April,\" so the devices could still be unveiled later this month. Gurman has also said that an announcement is possible <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/new-ipads-end-of-march-or-april-gurman/\">as early as the \"end of March.\"</a>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYoung reiterated that Apple plans to launch a larger 12.9-inch iPad Air as well, and it will likely be announced alongside the new iPad Pro models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\nThe following iPad-related announcements are expected in March or April:<ul><li>Two new iPad Pro models with the M3 chip, OLED displays, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-thinner/\">thinner enclosure</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/\">landscape-oriented front camera</a>, a redesigned rear camera bump and other design tweaks, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/\">possibly MagSafe wireless charging</a></li>\r<br />\n<li>Two new iPad Air models with the M2 chip and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/\">landscape-oriented front camera</a>, including a first-ever 12.9-inch model</li>\r<br />\n<li>A new Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro with a larger trackpad, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/\">a partially-aluminum enclosure</a>, and other design tweaks</li>\r<br />\n<li>A <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/new-apple-pencil-to-launch-this-month/\">new Apple Pencil</a></li></ul>Gurman previously <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/no-apple-event-for-new-ipads-macs-gurman/\">ruled out an Apple Event for the new iPads</a>.
