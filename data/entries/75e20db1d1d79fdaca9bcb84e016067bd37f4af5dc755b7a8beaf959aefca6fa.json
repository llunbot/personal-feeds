{"title":"American Classic relaunches with gravel and road tyre collection priced at just £30/$35","link":"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/american-classic-tyres/","date":1631708755000,"content":"<img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/American-Classic-Torchbearer-lifestyle-08c4831.jpg?quality=45&amp;resize=620,413\" />                                            <p>American Classic has relaunched with a collection of eight new tyres for gravel and road, covering a range of different terrains and riding styles.</p>\n<p>American Classic was originally founded by Bill Shook in 1982 and manufactured wheels, hubs and seatposts. The brand <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/wheel-maker-american-classic-shuts-down/\">closed down in 2018</a> and sold its intellectual property rights after difficulties with sales started in 2016.</p>\n<p>This re-entry into the cycling market marks a change in direction, shifting focus from wheels to tyres. On the relaunch, Bill Shook says: “When I founded American Classic in 1982, I sought to engineer the lightest components for road racers. It was important to me that American Classic’s new owners shared that sense of innovation. I look forward to seeing the American Classic name on tyres everywhere.”</p>\n<p>The range is currently only available in the USA via a direct-to-consumer model on its <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?me=A2F5KGSJTTMDQ3&amp;marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon store</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amclassic.com/collections/all\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, which the brand says helps to keep prices competitive, with all tyres costing £30/$35.</p>\n<p>On top of the low price, American Classic is also offering a Road Hazard Replacement policy for its tyres. Riders will be offered 50 per cent off the retail price of a new American Classic tyre if a puncture or rip occurs on a tyre while riding.</p>\n<h2>American Classic gravel tyres</h2>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/American-Classic-Kimberlite-fb8e826.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Kimberlite sits at the road end of the American Classic gravel tyre spectrum.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>American Classic</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/American-Classic-Aggregate-ee352d2.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Aggregate is said to be for mixed surfaces and hard-packed dirt.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>American Classic</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/American-Classic-UDDEN-525dbfb.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Udden has 70 per cent cornering grip, according to American Classic’s categorising system.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>American Classic</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/American-Classic-Krumbein-5795c4f.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Krumbein is American Classic’s hardest going gravel tyre and is designed for singletrack riding.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>American Classic</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/American-Classic-Wentworth-fe254a4.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Wentworth is only second to the Krumbein when it comes to cornering grip. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>American Classic</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nAiming to gain a foothold in the booming <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bike</a> market, the new collection includes five <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\">gravel tyres</a>, and American Classic claims the range is the most versatile on the market.\n<p>American Classic differentiates its gravel tyres according to ‘grip intensity’. It defines this as the percentage breakdown of cornering tread versus tread for rolling in a straight line. The tyres are also split by intended use, from pavement to singletrack.</p>\n<p>The collection is as follows:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Kimberlite –</strong> for road to mixed surface riding with 55 per cent cornering grip and 50 per cent rolling grip</li>\n<li><strong>Aggregate –</strong> for mixed surface to hard-packed dirt with 60 per cent cornering grip and 55 per cent rolling grip</li>\n<li><strong>Udden</strong> – for hard-packed dirt to loose gravel with 70 per cent cornering grip and 60 per cent rolling grip</li>\n<li><strong>Wentworth</strong> – for predominantly loose gravel but some singletrack with 75 per cent cornering grip and 70 per cent rolling grip</li>\n<li><strong>Krumbein</strong> – for loose gravel and singletrack with 85 per cent cornering grip and 80 per cent rolling grip</li>\n</ul><p>All the gravel tyres come in 40mm and 50mm width options for 700c and 47mm for 650b wheels. All tyres feature a 120 TPI casing, are <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless</a>-ready and come in either black or tan sidewall options.</p>\n<p>The gravel tyres are handmade at American Classics’s own facilities.</p>\n<h2>American Classic road tyres</h2>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/American-Classic-TIMEKEEPER-302488c.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Timekeeper is American Classic’s road race tyre.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>American Classic</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/American-Classic-TORCHBEARER-1ed356d.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Torchbearer is described as a “modern road standard”.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>American Classic</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/American-Classic-LAMPLIGHTER-BLACK-3509a42.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>American Classic’s commuting tyre is suitable for electric bikes.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>American Classic</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThe American Classic road tyre collection includes three models spanning road racing to commuting. American Classic says they will all be available with black, tan or ‘classic brown’ sidewalls.\n<p>The fastest rolling tyre in its road collection is the <strong>Timekeeper</strong> (though it has not provided rolling resistance data for any of its tyres), which is available in 25mm or 28mm widths.</p>\n<p>The Timekeeper has a minimal tyre tread that resembles the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/road-bike-tyres/continental-grand-prix-5000-clincher-tyre-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Continental Grand Prix 5000</a> tread pattern. The brand claims the Timekeeper’s 120 TPI construction and puncture protection lead to a supple tyre that will still fend off punctures.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Torchbearer</strong> road tyre is available in 25mm, 28mm and 32mm widths. It offers more cornering grip and puncture protection than the Timekeeper.</p>\n<p>American Classic says the Torchbearer constitutes a “modern road standard”, presumably following the trend for bikes with greater tyre clearance and many riders not shying away from some light gravel dalliances, even on their road machines.</p>\n<p>The Timekeeper and Torchbearer road tyres are available in different designs that can be run with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-inner-tubes/\">inner tubes</a> or set up <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-tubeless-road-tyres/\">tubeless</a>.</p>\n<p>The final tyre in American Classic’s range is the <strong>Lamplighter</strong>, which is aimed at commuting and is suitable for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">electric bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>The Lamplighter has the greatest puncture protection out of all American Classic’s tyres. Like the gravel tyres, it is available in 40mm and 50mm widths for 700c wheels and a 47mm option for 650b wheels. This tyre is only available to be run with inner tubes, though.</p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"75e20db1d1d79fdaca9bcb84e016067bd37f4af5dc755b7a8beaf959aefca6fa","category":"Cycling"}
