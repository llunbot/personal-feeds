Today, Ellsworth is announcing “a new chapter” in their history with limited runs of 450 for each model per year. Currently, those models will include the 100/120mm travel Truth, the 140mm travel Rogue, and new Roots gravel race bike. All models will exclusively run Industry Nine wheels moving forward, and they’ll be offered in Premium or Team-issue builds with the option hand pick individual spec like crank length, chainring, &amp; cassette size, colors, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Roots-Three-Qjpg-768x648-1.jpg\"><img width=\"768\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Roots-Three-Qjpg-768x648-1.jpg\" alt=\"Ellsworth Roots detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Roots-Three-Qjpg-768x648-1.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Roots-Three-Qjpg-768x648-1-297x251.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Roots-Three-Qjpg-768x648-1-120x101.jpg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Roots-Side-Shot-768x648-1.jpg\"><img width=\"768\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Roots-Side-Shot-768x648-1.jpg\" alt=\"Ellsworth Roots Detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Roots-Side-Shot-768x648-1.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Roots-Side-Shot-768x648-1-297x251.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Roots-Side-Shot-768x648-1-120x101.jpg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellsworth lists that the new Roots is the first of <em>two</em> new gravel models, and this one is geared towards gravel racing.
