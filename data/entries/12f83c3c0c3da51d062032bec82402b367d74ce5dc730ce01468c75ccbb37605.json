The system, known as AlphaEvolve, is based on the company's Gemini large language models (LLMs), with the addition of an \"evolutionary\" approach that evaluates and improves algorithms across a range of use cases.</p>\n<p>AlphaEvolve is essentially an AI coding agent, but it goes deeper than a standard Gemini chatbot. When you talk to Gemini, there is always a risk of hallucination, where the AI makes up details due to the non-deterministic nature of the underlying technology. AlphaEvolve uses an interesting approach to increase its accuracy when handling complex algorithmic problems.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/\">According to DeepMind</a>, this AI uses an automatic evaluation system. When a researcher interacts with AlphaEvolve, they input a problem along with possible solutions and avenues to explore. The model generates multiple possible solutions, using the efficient Gemini Flash and the more detail-oriented Gemini Pro, and then each solution is analyzed by the evaluator. An evolutionary framework allows AlphaEvolve to focus on the best solution and improve upon it.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/google-deepmind-creates-super-advanced-ai-that-can-invent-new-algorithms/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/google-deepmind-creates-super-advanced-ai-that-can-invent-new-algorithms/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"12f83c3c0c3da51d062032bec82402b367d74ce5dc730ce01468c75ccbb37605","category":"Tech"}
