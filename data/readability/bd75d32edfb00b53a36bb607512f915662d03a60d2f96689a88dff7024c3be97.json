Now Shimano says 55mm is the way to go and Trek’s all-in with the revamped Top Fuel (55mm chainline not just with Shimano cranks, but also SRAM and E13). I just can’t believe 55mm in the lowest gears can be good for a chain.</strong></p><p><strong>Julian Litterst, Scott Sports: </strong>55mm chainlines present no problem at all for the chain, cassette, and chainrings. This change has been tested on the world cup circuit for almost two years now. With leading groupset manufacturers stating that the increase in width is the way forward, we are confident that their products are being designed to work perfectly in this scenario.</p><div id=\"attachment_261430\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09081841/2022-Scott-Spark-900-XC-trail-mountain-bike_light-fully-integrated-cross-country-MTB_900-Tuned-AXS-complete-mtn.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-261430\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09081841/2022-Scott-Spark-900-XC-trail-mountain-bike_light-fully-integrated-cross-country-MTB_900-Tuned-AXS-complete-mtn.jpg\" alt=\"2022 Scott Spark RC &amp; 900 XC trail mountain bikes, light fully-integrated cross-country MTB,&nbsp;complete\" width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09081841/2022-Scott-Spark-900-XC-trail-mountain-bike_light-fully-integrated-cross-country-MTB_900-Tuned-AXS-complete-mtn.jpg 1500w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09081841/2022-Scott-Spark-900-XC-trail-mountain-bike_light-fully-integrated-cross-country-MTB_900-Tuned-AXS-complete-mtn-297x178.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09081841/2022-Scott-Spark-900-XC-trail-mountain-bike_light-fully-integrated-cross-country-MTB_900-Tuned-AXS-complete-mtn-800x480.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09081841/2022-Scott-Spark-900-XC-trail-mountain-bike_light-fully-integrated-cross-country-MTB_900-Tuned-AXS-complete-mtn-120x72.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09081841/2022-Scott-Spark-900-XC-trail-mountain-bike_light-fully-integrated-cross-country-MTB_900-Tuned-AXS-complete-mtn-768x461.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09081841/2022-Scott-Spark-900-XC-trail-mountain-bike_light-fully-integrated-cross-country-MTB_900-Tuned-AXS-complete-mtn-696x418.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09081841/2022-Scott-Spark-900-XC-trail-mountain-bike_light-fully-integrated-cross-country-MTB_900-Tuned-AXS-complete-mtn-1068x641.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09081841/2022-Scott-Spark-900-XC-trail-mountain-bike_light-fully-integrated-cross-country-MTB_900-Tuned-AXS-complete-mtn-700x420.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-261430\">The 2022 Scott Spark 900 Tuned AXS XC bike’s 55mm chainline gives room for up to 2.6″ tire clearance as well as the massive 40T chainrings that Nino races on around the widely-space PF92 bottom bracket.</p></div><p>From a frame engineering point of view, even tiny increases in clearance in this critical area can substantially help with frame strength, stiffness, and/or tire clearance.
