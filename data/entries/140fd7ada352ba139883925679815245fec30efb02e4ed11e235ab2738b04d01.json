It purchased worldwide exclusive rights to use material developed by LiquidMetal, a zirconium-based alloy with an amorphous structure used for small high-precision, high-performance parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until now, it hasn’t been clear why Apple purchased the company. The most notable LiquidMetal product has been the iPhone’s SIM ejector tool, and it has reportedly been used in some Apple Watch parts as well. However, a new rumor suggests that Apple’s investment in LiquidMetal could play a major role in the folding iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1902942517861159377\">According to Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, Apple is working on a hinge for a folding phone that will use liquid metal instead of traditional metal. “According to recent industry research, Apple is focused on improving durability, enhancing screen flatness, and minimizing crease marks in its foldable iPhone design,” he writes. “To achieve these goals, key components like the hinges will be crafted from liquid metal using a die-casting process.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be clear, the company LiquidMetal does not make metal parts that are actually fluid. Quite the opposite: It specializes in a special die-casting process that produces exceptionally strong, hard, and precise metal parts that do not require further shaping and finishing. The “liquid” part comes from the casting process and the amorphous atomic structure of the metal before casting, not the final form of the metal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kuo points to liquid metal purveyor EonTec as the “primary beneficiary” of Apple’s decision and doesn’t mention Apple’s own investment in LiquidMetal, but it has surely played a role in the development of the phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to launch its <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2629813/apple-folding-iphone-design-display-specs-release.html\">first folding iPhone</a> in 2026.
