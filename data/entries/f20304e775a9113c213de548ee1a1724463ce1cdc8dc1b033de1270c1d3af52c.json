{"title":"GQ: ‘Tim Cook Thinks Different’","link":"https://www.gq.com/story/tim-cook-global-creativity-awards-cover-2023","date":1680575012000,"content":"\n<p>Zach Baron’s cover story for GQ, a profile of Tim Cook, is a must-read:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And yet Cook is, in the wealth of biographies and hagiography that\nhas grown up around Apple since its founding, an enigma still.\n“He’s very hard to read,” says Eddy Cue, who has been at Apple\nsince 1989 and now leads its services division. “If you’re looking\nto make your decision or your beliefs based on reading his facial\nexpressions, you’re probably not going to be good at that. I\nalways joke around with him that he’d be a great poker player,\nbecause he’d have four aces and no one would know.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Cook’s world-class poker face makes him difficult to profile, I think. Baron’s piece seems to get to Cook’s personality better than any I’ve read before. For example, noting that Cook laughed here:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Years ago, when asked about the possibility of Apple manufacturing\nglasses, in the mold of Google Glass, an early AR product, Cook\ntold The New Yorker’s Ian Parker that he was skeptical of the\nenterprise: “We always thought that glasses were not a smart move,\nfrom a point of view that people would not really want to wear\nthem. They were intrusive, instead of pushing technology to the\nbackground, as we’ve always believed.” He said then: “We always\nthought it would flop, and, you know, so far it has.”</p>\n\n<p>When I raise this with Cook, he laughs. “My thinking always\nevolves. Steve taught me well: never to get married to your\nconvictions of yesterday. To always, if presented with something\nnew that says you were wrong, admit it and go forward instead of\ncontinuing to hunker down and say why you’re right.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/03/tim-cook-gq\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f20304e775a9113c213de548ee1a1724463ce1cdc8dc1b033de1270c1d3af52c","category":"Tech"}
