At $5,000, three percent Daily Cash is unlocked. Spending $10,000 unlocks four percent Daily Cash, and spending $15,000 unlocks five percent Daily Cash.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou will need to spend at least $5,000 to get the bonus, and it is not retroactive, so it will only apply to purchases made after you hit each spending limit.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says that the offer is limited to select ‌Apple Card‌ users who receive a notification about it in the Wallet app. Those eligible who have ‌Apple Card‌ participants will see shared spending count toward the total.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor ‌Apple Card‌ partner stores that already offer three percent cash back, there will be no additional Daily Cash increase until the four percent tier is reached. The Daily Cash bonus is available on up to $50,000 in total purchases.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-card-promo-daily-cash-back/\">Apple Card Users Can Get Up to 5% Daily Cash on All Purchases Through Holiday Season</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-card-users-can-get-up-to-5-daily-cash-on-all-purchases-through-holiday-season.2441195/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6f794c9fdb16be71a54599a100b976f03e9caebf89b895fa87b36ed5885277c3","category":"Apple"}
