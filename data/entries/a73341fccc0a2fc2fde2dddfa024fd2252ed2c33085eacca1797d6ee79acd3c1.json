It integrates more directly with the vehicle to provide information on all of the driver's screens, featuring real-time content and gauges in the instrument cluster with options for the speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge, temperature gauge, and more. Drivers can choose to display information from the iPhone, such as maps and media, alongside information from the vehicle, such as advanced driver assistance systems and tire pressure.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Releases iOS 18.5 With New Wallpaper, Screen Time Changes, Carrier Satellite Support for iPhone 13 and More</h2>\r<br />\nAs expected, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-releases-ios-18-5/\">Apple this week released iOS 18.5 and iPadOS 18.5</a>, relatively minor updates with only a few changes, feature additions, and bug fixes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iOS-18.5-Apple-Intelligence-Color-Palette-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nRelated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-releases-macos-sequoia-15-5/\">macOS Sequoia 15.5</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-releases-watchos-11-5/\">watchOS 11.5</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-releases-tvos-18-5/\">tvOS 18.5</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-releases-visionos-2-5/\">visionOS 2.5</a> updates were also released this week, and we're expecting at least one more round of x.6 updates to the current major operating system versions as Apple prepares to unveil iOS 19 and friends at WWDC next month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Preparing to Launch Mind-Control Support for iPhones</h2>\r<br />\nIt sounds like science fiction, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/13/apple-preparing-to-launch-mind-control-support/\">Apple is indeed working with neurotechnology startup Synchron</a> to allow users with severe motor impairments to control their devices via neural signals detected by an implantable brain-computer device called the Stentrode.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iOS-19-Accessibility-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe news comes as Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/13/apple-previews-ios-19-accessibility-features/\">announced a wide range of new accessibility features</a> coming to its products later this year. Based on previous patterns, most of these new and improved features will come with iOS 19 and related updates.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Top Five Announcements to Look Forward to at WWDC 2025</h2>\r<br />\nTime sure flies, and we're now less than a month away from the 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference where Apple will introduce new software updates. Rumors are picking up ahead of the event, so <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/14/wwdc-top-five-features/\">we thought we'd highlight some of the updates</a> that we're looking forward to learning more about.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/WWDC25-One-Month-Thumb-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nWWDC 2025 will begin with a keynote event on June 9 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. Apple will have a live stream available, but we'll also be providing coverage here on MacRumors.com and through the MacRumorsLive Twitter account for those who aren't able to watch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Acquisition Hints at Upgraded Calendar App on iOS 19 or Beyond</h2>\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/09/apple-acquired-mayday-labs/\">acquired Canadian startup Mayday Labs</a> in April 2024, according to a European Commission listing recently spotted by French blog MacGeneration.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/Mayday-Calendar.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nMayday Labs had developed an AI-powered calendar, task manager, and scheduling assistant for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. The all-in-one app used AI to automatically schedule your events and tasks at ideal times, and it could learn your scheduling preferences and daily patterns over time to further optimize your calendar.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt would be reasonable to assume that some of Mayday's features and technologies could be added to Apple's Calendar app across the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, under the Apple Intelligence umbrella.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Music Gets New Transfer Tool to Make Switching From Spotify Easier</h2>\r<br />\nApple this week introduced a new feature designed to allow prospective Apple Music users to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/14/apple-music-transfer-tool/\">import their saved music and playlists from third-party music services to ‌Apple Music‌</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/apple-music.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe feature is either in an expanded testing phase or it has started rolling out, and it is available in Australia and New Zealand according to an Apple Support document.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is partnering with SongShift for the new ‌Apple Music‌ feature. SongShift is an app that transfers music playlists across streaming platforms, but by working with Apple, the functionality has been integrated directly in the ‌Apple Music‌ app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/may-15-2025\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/17/top-stories-carplay-ultra-debuts/\">Top Stories: CarPlay Ultra Debuts, iOS 18.5 Released, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-carplay-ultra-debuts-ios-18-5-released-and-more.2457248/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a73341fccc0a2fc2fde2dddfa024fd2252ed2c33085eacca1797d6ee79acd3c1","category":"Apple"}
