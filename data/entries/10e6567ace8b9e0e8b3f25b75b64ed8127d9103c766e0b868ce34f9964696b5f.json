Since then, demand for coal has plummeted, largely due to the rise of natural gas and renewable energy. Taking federal coal off the table in the basin could all but put an expiration date on the nation’s thermal coal industry.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025541#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025541&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Inside Climate News","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"10e6567ace8b9e0e8b3f25b75b64ed8127d9103c766e0b868ce34f9964696b5f","category":"Tech"}
