The most recent update was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-releases-homepod-software-17-4/\">released on March 7</a>, and enables <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> to learn what your preferred media service is. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/HomePod-2-and-HomePod-Mini.jpeg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nBy default, updates are installed on your ‌HomePod‌ devices automatically, but there's also a way to force an update if new software is released. However, Apple's auto-update function isn't typically immediate, so it can sometimes be handy to have a way to manually install software when you know an update has become available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/update-homepod-17.4.jpg\" alt=\"home\" width=\"4137\" height=\"2716\" />\r<br />\nLocating ‌HomePod‌ updates and checking on the software version you have installed is pretty simple, but it's not entirely intuitive because the update function is buried in the Home app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe following steps show you how to update your ‌HomePod‌ on devices running <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a> and later.\r<br />\n<ol>\r<br />\n<li>Open the <strong>Home</strong> app.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap on the icon that looks like three dots in the upper right corner.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap <strong>Home Settings</strong> in the dropdown menu that appears.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Software Update</strong> to see if there are any available updates.</li>\r<br />\n</ol>\r<br />\nOnce you've selected \"Software Update,\" you'll be able to see the current version of the ‌HomePod‌ software that you have installed, along with available updates, and you can toggle off automatic updates if you want.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf there is an available update, you just need to tap the <strong>Install</strong> button to update your ‌HomePod‌. If you have multiple HomePods in your home, each one will be updated at the same time through this software update feature. If you're registered for ‌HomePod‌ Beta Updates, a menu option will also appear here for updating individual HomePods.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/homepod-software-update/\">How to Update to HomePod Software 17.4</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-update-to-homepod-software-17-4.2105572/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1d5f536661c1f80e0fe6e3cb15b9b404ef2089d40353e224c8766e13d4387969","category":"Apple"}
