Even if your system isn't affected by this specific bug because you're running Windows 10 or a lower-core-count Ryzen CPU, the new driver has fixes for a handful of other Ryzen and Threadripper systems running either Windows 10 or Windows 11.</p>\n<p>Another issue affected L3 cache latency on all Ryzen processors, lowering performance by between 3 and 5 percent for most apps and by up to 15 percent for some games.Â Microsoft began issuing a fix for the L3 cache issue <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/fixes-for-amd-ryzen-performance-other-windows-11-issues-rolling-out-to-testers-now/\">to testers last week</a>, and it's one of the many issues fixed in build 22000.282 of Windows 11 (you can see your build number by typing \"winver\" into a Run window or Windows Search).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806412#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806412&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"040771438df41efaa021b35b1bed9a34323e01663cce1d30e2cb411bdc396ddb","category":"Tech"}
