They\nsuspected that he had pursued a widely mocked tactic known as\n“boosting,” paying strangers to play his character and rake in\nloot so that, when he logged in, he could face challenges with the\nmost powerful gear.</p>\n\n<p>Musk fought the allegations before ultimately confessing in\nmessages this month. “It’s impossible to beat players in Asia if\nyou don’t,” he wrote. A few days later, his character could be\nseen chasing treasure through the game’s sulfuric caverns while\n<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/20/billionaires-trump-inauguration-elon-musk-jeff-bezos/\">Musk was in the Capitol Rotunda, attending President Donald\nTrump’s inauguration</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Every cheater’s story is the same: “<em>I’m not cheating, and I’m offended you’d accuse me.</em>” Then, presented with incontrovertible proof, “<em>I had to cheat because everyone else is cheating so it’s the only way to win, and anyone who isn’t doing it is a simp.</em>” But the simple truth is that cheaters are rotten people, and most people naturally despise cheating.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But watching Musk’s streams, Jake began to suspect foul play. The\nbillionaire did amateurish things, such as failing to drink mana\nflasks when he needed them and trying to pick up items when his\ninventory was full. And he made comments that struck devoted\nplayers as clueless, saying, for instance, that his character’s\n“Hand of Wisdom and Action” gloves, which rank among the game’s\nmost valuable items, “could be better.” A normal gamer could write\nthese off as simple flubs in the heat of battle, Jake said. But\nMusk was supposedly a global grand master, and gamers at that\nlevel don’t make these kinds of mistakes.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s like if you said you’re the number two truck driver in the\nworld … and when you try to get the truck to turn on, the\nwindshield wipers start going,” Jake said. “It just felt like\nthere was no way this guy did this.”</p>\n\n<p>When Jake posted a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1hwxc17/documenting_the_saga_of_elon_musks_account/\">thread</a> on Reddit documenting Musk’s\n“suspicious” gameplay, the accusations kicked up a firestorm, with\n“Path of Exile 2” fans scraping through the streams Musk had\nposted to X for clues of what some were calling his <a href=\"https://x.com/Diamonte916/status/1878047536336052365\">“stolen\nvalor.”</a> [...]</p>\n\n<p>By paying someone else to earn him his high-level gear, they\nsaid, he had removed most of the challenge — only to boast how\nquickly he had beaten others who played fair and square. One\nposter on a Diablo subreddit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1hxi3vh/gamers_are_accusing_elon_musk_of_cheating_at/\">called</a> it “unbelievably\npathetic” that the world’s richest man would feel “the need to\ncheat” in a video game to “claim he is good at something” most\npeople “couldn’t care less about.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s the boasting that’s most revealing.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a trope as old as fiction itself that villains cheat at everything. Auric Goldfinger cheated at golf, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTBvu-fTTIk\">famously</a>. And in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Moonraker-James-Bond-Ian-Fleming/dp/1612185452/?tag=df-amzn-20\">Ian Fleming’s <em>Moonraker</em></a> (but not the movie), the whole plot was driven by M’s suspicion that mysterious millionaire (the billionaire of the 1950s) industrialist Hugo Drax was cheating at cards at their gentlemen’s club. He assigned Bond to figure out how he was cheating, and Bond stumbled into Drax’s plot to annihilate London. Drax, you see, is in fact a Nazi. And his industry: rocketry.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/elon-musk-cheats-at-video-games\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"08c223d682dabeafb25d4fb7c3b9fa6a4a61e527caa0950263cb5ba86bd5eb2a","category":"Tech"}
