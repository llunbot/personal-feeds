This year's ‌iPhone‌ features considerable upgrades compared to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a>, including a ProMotion display, smaller notch, and more premium camera features. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Nikkie Asia</em> reports that production issues should begin to clear up in mid-October but adds caution that some of Apple's other suppliers, such as Foxconn and Pegatron, could start to see issues in the near future. On the flip side, the ‌iPhone 13‌'s high demand is leading some of Apple's suppliers to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/29/iphone-taiwan-suppliers-prioritize-apple/\">prioritize the Cupertino tech giant over other clients</a>. \r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>The situation may improve as soon as around mid-October as production at one of the key iPhone camera module manufacturing facilities in southern Vietnam has gradually resumed in recent days after several months of on-and-off disruption, another executive familiar with the situation told Nikkei.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSo far, key iPhone assemblers Foxconn, Pegatron and Luxshare have not yet been significantly affected by the power cuts, Nikkei learned. But still unknown is the scope of a potential chain reaction from production halts at the makers of materials, components, modules and parts.</blockquote>Apple's suppliers have also had to battle reduced work hours due to new energy restrictions in China, ultimately impacting production.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nikkei-com/\">nikkei.com</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13\">iPhone 13 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13-Pro\">iPhone 13 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/29/iphone-13-production-issues-long-delivery-times/\">iPhone 13 Reportedly Having Production Issues, Leaving Customers to Face Prolonged Delivery Times</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-13-reportedly-having-production-issues-leaving-customers-to-face-prolonged-delivery-times.2314358/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=YiPNmWK6TRE:nRsQ5TJ-W5E:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=YiPNmWK6TRE:nRsQ5TJ-W5E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/YiPNmWK6TRE\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d83aceb98e03f5355e8ada792fcb01465a8142226b2ebd20b46b7293fae2fb3e","category":"Apple"}
