He <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/phil-schiller-epic-games-v-apple/\">testified during the Epic v. Apple lawsuit</a> to ardently defend the ‌App Store‌, and he is involved in Apple's EU messaging as well. Schiller joined in on Apple PR calls with members of the media when the iOS 17.4 changes were announced, and he spent time explaining how the DMA will impact user privacy and security in Europe.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen Apple terminated the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/06/apple-explains-terminating-epic-games-account/\">Epic Games developer account</a> in March to prevent it from creating an alternate app marketplace, it was Schiller <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/apple-reinstates-epic-games-developer-account-eu/\">who sent an email</a> to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/\">Epic Games</a> CEO Tim Sweeney to suggest that the account had been shut down because of Epic's criticism of Apple's DMA compliance. Schiller's email did not go over well with the European Commission, and Apple ultimately reversed its decision.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to <em>The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/\">Wall Street Journal</a></em>, Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> defers to Schiller when it comes to ‌App Store‌ matters. Schiller joined Apple back in 1987, left in 1993, and returned in 1997 when Steve Jobs came back to Apple. He has been at the forefront of some of Apple's biggest product launches, developing marketing strategies for everything from the iPod to the Mac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHe was one of the main supporters of adding third-party apps to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, working to convince Jobs to launch the ‌App Store‌ in 2008. Known as a Jobs \"mini-me,\" Schiller has reportedly kept Jobs' philosophy alive at Apple. Under his watch, human review has remained a key part of the ‌App Store‌, and the ‌App Store‌ has grown into a major revenue stream for Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMore on Schiller can be <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-turns-to-longtime-steve-jobs-disciple-to-defend-its-walled-garden-2ab44fae\">read in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>'s full profile</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phil-schiller/\">Phil Schiller</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/apple-phil-schiller-profile/\">Apple's Phil Schiller Works 80 Hours a Week Overseeing App Store</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-phil-schiller-works-80-hours-a-week-overseeing-app-store.2422966/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"eb3c997f8dc8de155607d3d9e96bf538c990ac2be231b5870b1defe9ef4886a4","category":"Apple"}
