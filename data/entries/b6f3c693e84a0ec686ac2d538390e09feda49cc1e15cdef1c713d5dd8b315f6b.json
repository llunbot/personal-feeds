We’ll finish by explaining the benefits of the more expensive groupsets and discussing compatibility.</p>\n<p>If knobbly tyres are more your thing, we’ve got a separate guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/mountain-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">mountain bike groupsets</a>.

It began life in Japan in 1921 when Shozaburo Shimano decided to start making freewheels in a rented corner of a demolished celluloid factory.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to today, and it’s become so successful that Shimano now accounts for at least half of the global bike components industry.</p>\n<section>\n    <div>\n        \n<h4>Shimano road groupset ranking</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Claris R2000:</strong> 8-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Sora R3000:</strong> 9-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Tiagra 4700:</strong> 10-speed</li>\n<li><strong>105 R7100:</strong> 12-speed</li>\n<li><strong>105 Di2 R7150:</strong> 12-speed electronic only</li>\n<li><strong>Ultegra Di2 R8100:</strong> 12-speed electronic only</li>\n<li><strong>Dura-Ace Di2 R9200:</strong> 12-speed electronic only</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section>\n\n<h3>Entry-level Shimano groupsets: Claris, Sora and Tiagra</h3>\n<h4>Shimano Claris R2000</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The latest Claris R2000 groupset borrows design cues from its more expensive siblings\" title=\"claris-1520601513622-jdhhkljjrydb-8b0dae4\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The latest Claris R2000 may be Shimano’s cheapest road groupset but it still borrows design cues from its more expensive siblings.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gearing:</strong> 8-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Shifting:</strong> Mechanical</li>\n<li><strong>Braking:</strong> Rim</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Shimano component range starts with the budget-priced <strong>Shimano</strong> <strong>Claris</strong>, which is usually found on the most affordable bikes available.</p>\n<p>Claris is an 8-speed system (eight gears at the rear) combined with either a double or triple crankset (two or three gears at the front).

This gives you a slightly easier climbing gear while still retaining a big top gear. It is a popular option among competitive amateur riders</li>\n<li>The <strong><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-a-compact-crank/\">compact crankset</a></strong> is 50/34. It has become very popular thanks to its combination of easy gearing and low weight</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/road/gear/article/super-compact-chainsets-the-next-big-thing-for-road-cyclists-48974/\">Super-compact or sub-compact cranksets</a></strong> offer an even lower gear range on double chainrings, such as 48t/32, 48/31 or 46/30. These are becoming popular with gravel riders and bikepackers who want the low, closely spaced gearing a 2x setup can offer.</li>\n<li>SRAM upset the applecart when it went 12-speed and introduced cassettes with a 10t small cog, rather than 11 teeth. That lets it achieve similar gear ratios with smaller chainrings, saving weight and offering even wider ranges. SRAM’s second-tier Force eTap AXS groupset now includes a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-force-etap-axs-wide-gearing/\">low-range 43/30t option</a>, for example.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Triple cranksets</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>triple</strong> is an older type of chainset commonly seen on vintage road bikes and touring bikes. It offers a wide range of gears, but at a weight penalty by adding a third chainring. It typically combines a 50t outer ring, a 39t middle ring and an inner ring that has just 30 teeth. It is popular with touring cyclists who value a super-small ‘spinny’ ring when loaded down with panniers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Single cranksets</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>single-ring crankset</strong> has only one chainring. To compensate for the loss of the smaller, inner ring, a 1× crankset is often matched to a wider-range cassette. Single ring cranksets use alternating wide and narrow teeth with a higher profile, to aid chain retention.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Road bike shifters explained</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"GRX lever\" title=\"Enigma Escape titanium-9\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> While the overall shape is similar, the three major brands have their own different methods of shifting.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>For the most part, modern road bikes use dual-action shifters that incorporate the gear levers into the brake levers.</p>\n<p>Each brand has its own spin on the concept, so how you shift mechanical gears on a Shimano-equipped bike is slightly different to how you shift on a Campagnolo- or SRAM-equipped bike.</p>\n<p>Electronic shifting still relies on paddles built into the brake levers but uses small servomotors in the derailleurs to make them move.</p>\n<p>Electronic drivetrains offer consistently precise shifting and lower maintenance than a mechanically actuated <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/drivetrains-explained-all-of-the-parts-that-make-your-bike-go/\">drivetrain</a>.</p>\n<p>For a full explanation of how the different systems change gear, read our detailed article on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/technique/how-to-change-gear-on-a-bike/\">how to change gear on a road bike</a>.</p>\n<h3>Road bike brakes explained</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rim and disc brakes\" title=\"Brake types\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Road brakes come in various forms, but basically, boil down to rim brakes (left) and disc brakes (right).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The complications don’t end with the various shift actions and whether they’re mechanically or electronically actuated.

The amount of weight that you save for your money diminishes dramatically at the upper end, though.</p>\n<p>These weight differences are the result of more expensive materials and refined, or more time-consuming, manufacturing processes.</p>\n<p>In addition to further machining, hole-drilling and high precision, more expensive components often use materials such as carbon fibre, titanium, lightweight aluminium and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/ceramic-bearings/\">ceramic bearings</a> to achieve the pinnacle in low weight and performance.</p>\n<h3>Durability</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Nine tips to conquer the Rapha Festive 500 this year\" title=\"Female cyclist climbing on a road bike in winter\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Today’s road groupsets can take all sorts of punishment, even off the tarmac.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robert Smith / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If you’re spending more money on a groupset, you’d expect it to outlast a cheaper option. Durability does improve with price, but our experience is that durability also plateaus at the second-tier options, and in some ways, actually starts to decline at the most expensive option.</p>\n<p>The more expensive technical components are built with greater precision, refinement and materials that lend themselves to greater longevity. This is apparent in derailleurs and shifters where the cheaper options will develop play and slop over time, while the better parts often remain like new.</p>\n<p>Wear items, such as cassettes and chainrings, however, are often the reverse of this. Cheaper options are made of heavier but more durable steels, while the more expensive versions are sometimes made from lighter but softer aluminium or titanium alloys.</p>\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"SRAM Force AXS Ride Shots (brazodehierro) 23\" title=\"SRAM Force AXS Ride Shots (brazodehierro) 23\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Improved performance is the promise of higher-priced groupsets: smoother, more precise and quicker shifts between gears, stiffer cranks and better braking.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>In addition to the benefits of reduced weight, more expensive groupsets find other ways of increasing performance. Most noticeably, higher-priced options provide a smoother, more precise and in some cases quicker shift between gears.</p>\n<p>This includes reduced effort at the lever, something that becomes apparent once you’ve been on the bike for a few hours. It’s an area where electronic gears set the benchmark; ultimate precision at the simple push of a button.</p>\n<p>Another performance example is increased crankset stiffness to provide crisper shifting and more efficient power transfer from the pedals to the rear wheel. This is achieved with more complex designs, and materials that increase strength and stiffness, but don’t add weight.</p>\n<p>Braking raises an entire new list of benefits as prices go up. Simply put, more expensive brakes are stronger, offer better feel and control, and stop you with less hand force required.</p>\n<p>This difference is much more apparent with rim brakes, though. There’s hardly any meaningful performance difference between low- and high-end hydraulic disc brakes.</p>\n<h3>Additional features</h3>\n<p>Besides offering extra gears, the more expensive groupsets usually get new features first.</p>\n<p>Shimano first launched Di2 electronic shifting at the Dura-Ace level, before trickling it down to Ultegra. The same is true of more mundane details – Dura-Ace was the first to get reach adjustment using a built-in screw rather than ugly shims, a feature now found all the way down to Claris level.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Shimano and Campagnolo now offer their higher-end cranksets in a universal size that’s cross-compatible with its range of chainrings. This means if you ever wish to change your chainring sizes, you can do so without needing a new crankset.</p>\n<h2>Groupset compatibility issues</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Berria Belader Allroad LTD against a graffiti background\" title=\"BR_09978\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Watch out for compatibility issues when upgrading individual components.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>It’s worth being aware that not all groupset components from a given manufacturer are compatible with one another, even in cases where it seems like they should be.</p>\n<p>Manufacturers tend to update their ranges incrementally over time so you can’t always assume, for example, that one 11-speed component will work with another if they’re not from the same year or groupset.</p>\n<p>There are differences in the precise amount of cable pulled by different rim brake levers too, so you may not get optimal performance if you move up the hierarchy when you replace individual parts.</p>\n<p>That said, groupsets of a given brand are generally designed to work with each other, providing they share the same number of gears. (i.e. Shimano 11-speed with Shimano 11-speed, Campagnolo 11-speed with Campagnolo 11-speed.)</p>\n<p>For specific compatibility queries, we’d suggest you ask your local retailer before buying, consult manufacturer technical documents online, or <a href=\"https://forum.bikeradar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">seek advice on our forum</a>.
