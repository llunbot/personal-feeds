Unfortunately, the stranger drops the iPhone, leading to a moment of suspense given the device might have been damaged. However, the display glass remains intact due to the Ceramic Shield.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Relax, it's iPhone 16,\" the video description concludes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOf course, your mileage may vary.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple introduced the Ceramic Shield on all iPhone 12 models, and it has continued to improve the glass-ceramic material's formulation over the years.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/\">Apple Ads</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ceramic-shield/\">Ceramic Shield</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16\">iPhone 16 (Neutral)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/iphone-16-trust-issues-ad/\">iPhone 16 Ad Highlights a Key Advantage Over Android Smartphones</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-ad-highlights-a-key-advantage-over-android-smartphones.2455895/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"296affd5cb6ddb7f56be676a3ba79157a86d08929e89b225ac83f508445afd9c","category":"Apple"}
