Yesterday, I attended a <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/aws-ug-jakarta/events/296076566\">community event</a> – a collaboration between <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/AWS-User-Group-Indonesia/\">AWS User Group Indonesia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hacktiv8.com/\">Hacktiv8</a> with “Innovating Yourself as Early-Stage Developers” as the main theme. We had a blast and I had a wonderful time connecting with speakers and developers.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/09/25/awsug-hacktiv8-20230924.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/09/25/awsug-hacktiv8-20230924.png\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" /></a></p> \n<p>Next up, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/id/events/cloud-day-indonesia/\">AWS Cloud Day Indonesia</a>. I’ll be at the Developer Lounge, come and say hi!</p> \n<p><span><strong>Last Week’s Launches</strong></span><br /> Here are some of the launches that caught my attention last week:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-add-your-swift-packages-to-aws-codeartifact/\">Add Your Swift Packages to AWS CodeArtifact</a> – In this article, Seb describes how <a href=\"https://www.swift.org/\">Swift</a> developers who write code for Apple platforms (<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/ios/\">iOS</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/ipados/\">iPadOS</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/macos/\">macOS</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/tvos/\">tvOS</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/watchos/\">watchOS</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/visionos/\">visionOS</a> or <a href=\"https://www.swift.org/server/\">Swift</a>) applications running on the server side can use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/codeartifact\">AWS CodeArtifact</a> to securely store and retrieve their package dependencies. What I really like is how developers can still use standard developer tools, such as <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/xcode/\">Xcode</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2339/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40014588-CH1-HOW_DO_I_BUILD_MY_PROJECTS_FROM_THE_COMMAND_LINE_\">xcodebuild</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.swift.org/package-manager/\">Swift Package Manager</a> (the <code>swift package</code> command) to interact with AWS CodeArtifact and facilitate integration into the development workflow.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/09/12/2023-09-12_00-03-46.png\" width=\"1600\" height=\"504\" /></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-m2-pro-mac-instances-built-on-apple-silicon-m2-pro-mac-mini-computers/\">Amazon EC2 M2 Pro Mac Instances Built on Apple Silicon M2 Pro Mac Mini Computers</a> – Channy wrote how developers can use Amazon EC2 M2 Pro Mac to run memory intensive builds and test workloads, modernize their CI/CD and accelerate their product time to market.
