We headed down to capture some of the highlights</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Words: </strong>Will Strickson <strong>Photos: </strong>Col Morley</p>\n<p>Lockdown took a lot away from us in 2020 including toilet roll, the Tour of Guangxi and feeling comfortable in public. One of the biggest things we missed was Bespoked, the UK's handmade bicycle show.</p>\n<p>Last weekend it finally returned, with frame builders, component brands and a public desperate to check out some steel workmanship descended – and ascended – upon Harrogate Convention Centre in north Yorkshire.</p>\n<p><em>Cyclist </em>was fortunate enough to be invited down on Friday to check out the show, see some old friends and find new material for the magazine. Here are some of the highlights and stories to look out for in future editions.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/10/002_8936.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Look at the delight on this guy's face as he checks out the work of <a href=\"https://www.spooncustoms.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Spoon Customs</a>, you can't get that over Zoom.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.spooncustoms.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><br />\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/10/nd5_7904.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p></p></a></p>\n<p>Ironbridge's <a href=\"https://www.bicycles-by-design.co.uk/bicycles/swallow/\" target=\"_blank\">Swallow</a> has been building bikes for over 40 years, meaning, alongside classic road and touring bikes, Pete and Rob have built gravel bikes since they were mountain bikes.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/10/nd5_7925.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>This one, kitted out with Dutch-style Jones handlebar, Pinion gearing and a belt drive system, is a versatile, electric-ready bike perfect for commuting and delivers a lesson in the finer details.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/10/nd5_8566.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Hope was also there with its aerodynamic beasts in the form of Team GB's Olympic track bike, and the unique time-trial bike ridden by Ethan Vernon in the World Championships. A live lay-up was also on display and, as you can imagine, it caught an eye or two.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/10/nd5_7948.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>What do you do when the government imposes a six o'clock <em>couvre-feu? </em>Head to the workshop and start a bike company. At least that's what Marie and Laurent of <a href=\"https://www.avalanche-cycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Avalanche Cycles</a> did.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/10/nd5_7967.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Producing sleek steel road and gravel bikes built for the mountains, the pair do it all, right through to the stunning paint jobs.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/10/nd5_8657.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>While bike builders tend to be more down to earth than most, American brand Thomson, which specialises in using aerospace technology for bike parts and framesets, also made an appearance. Who needs spaceships when you can have a bike?</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/10/nd5_8021.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>No prizes for guessing whose bike this is. An impressive TIG welded frame built from Columbus XCr and Spirit shows what <a href=\"https://ryden.bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Ryden Bikes</a> is all about. The Subaru World Rally paint isn't bad either.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/10/nd5_8010.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Darren Ryden was also showing off a geometry alignment tool and an app he created for super easy set ups with helpful calculations of saddle height, saddle set back, saddle tilt, bottom bracket height, handlebar height, saddle to handlebar distance and handlebar drop.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/10/nd5_8674.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Bespoked's previous home in Bristol was in a room with huge windows drawing in light from all angles, but this time windows were the only thing missing. That might've helped draw attention to what mattered though, as <a href=\"https://www.enigmabikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Enigma Bicycle Works</a>'s display proved.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/10/nd5_8054.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.halletthandbuiltcycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hallett Handbuilt Bicycles</a> was showing off this beautiful vintage build with downtube shifters.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/10/nd5_8060.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>As former technical editor of <em>Cycling Weekly</em> he's ridden one or two and knows all about details. Check out his handmade steel stem and the fine detailing on the top tube.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/10/nd5_8381.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>It's not all metal, <a href=\"https://www.twmpacycles.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Twmpa Cycles</a> was among the builders present who specialise in wooden frames.

But happily, that's because he's taking over the running of Bespoked from Phil and Tessa, so we're hoping his influence will spread throughout the weekend next year.
