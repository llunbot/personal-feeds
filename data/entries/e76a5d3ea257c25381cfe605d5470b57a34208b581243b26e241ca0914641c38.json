(<em>And maybe even heavier conventional mountain bikes, too.</em>) With more and heavier performance ebikes and eMTBs being sold, we’ve seen more tool companies adding motorized professional work stands to lift those heavy two-wheelers. But Feedback wanted a more compact, more affordable solution for ebike buyers to do their own regular repairs at home. And they may have also created a good solution for smaller bike shops that would benefit from an electric lift stand, but didn’t want or need such massive, expensive stand permanently in their workshop. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Feedback Sports Pro E Lift home ebike repair work stand</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_low-roll-in-height.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_low-roll-in-height.jpg\" alt=\"Feedback Sports Pro E Lift telescoping electric assist home bicycle repair stand for ebike eMTB mechanics, down\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_low-roll-in-height.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_low-roll-in-height-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_low-roll-in-height-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_low-roll-in-height-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_low-roll-in-height-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_low-roll-in-height-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_low-roll-in-height-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Unveiled at Eurobike this week, the all-new Feedback Pro E Lift is a unique way to look at motorized repair stands in general. And also, how to solve the needs of ebikers who want to wrench on their own rides at home. And maybe those of us at home with heavier long-travel mountain bikes, too!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty much every company builds their modern electric lift-assist repair stands as a permanently-fixed solution in a professional bike workshop. That’s meant some great integration of things like charging solutions, power access, ready-acces tool storage, and even laptop/tablet mounts for access to online resources. But heavy-duty construction and tons of features also make those stands extremely expensive, take up a lot of floor space, and be a permanent fixture in the workshop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Feedback Pro E Lift is pretty much the opposite of all of that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It uses a lighter-duty lift mechanism, dials back lifting height to a reasonable but completely sufficient range, and uses a stable but roll-away base so it doesn’t always have to take up so much room. And simple metal foot button switches make adjustment up &amp; down easy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, it’s less than half the price of comparable professional e-lift repair stands.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_foot-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_foot-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Feedback Sports Pro E Lift telescoping electric assist home bicycle repair stand for ebike eMTB mechanics, foto detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_foot-detail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_foot-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_foot-detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_foot-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_foot-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_foot-detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_foot-detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Do I personally need it? I don’t even have my own eMTB at home, so no.. not really. But I kinda would still love to have a compact Pro E Lift stand at home. Even if that’s just to work on my more burly enduro bikes, and the occasional e-test bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_adjustable-foot-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_adjustable-foot-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Feedback Pro E Lift electric assist home bicycle repair stand for ebikes, foot detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_adjustable-foot-detail.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_adjustable-foot-detail-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_adjustable-foot-detail-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_adjustable-foot-detail-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_adjustable-foot-detail-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Feedback)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Feedback developed the Pro E Lift repair stand to be easy-to-use and live with for amateur DIY home mechanics. That means it’s relatively compact – taking up a 29”/74cm square footprint. Not too heavy, and even though stable when in-use, roll it a bit out-of-the-way when you don’t need it. And it works with other regular Feedback workstand tool holder access. The 55lb/34kg work stand even arrives mostly assembled. So the DIYer only really needs to bolt on the wide base before getting to work on their eMTB.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_clamp-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_clamp-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Feedback Sports Pro E Lift telescoping electric assist home bicycle repair stand for ebike eMTB mechanics, clamp detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_clamp-detail.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_clamp-detail-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_clamp-detail-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Sports-Pro-E-Lift-telescoping-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebike-eMTB-mechanics_clamp-detail-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The stand has over 3’/1m of lift to get eMTB/ebikes up to your preferred working height – quickly &amp; quietly adjustable depending what kind of maintenance or repair task you need to carry out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The clamp head starts as low as 34”/84cm off the ground to grab you ebike’s seatpost without any lifting needed. The stand’s flat feet are easy to roll over, but still have adjusters to accommodate uneven floor surfaces. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you just step on the metal up/down buttons on the repair stand base to lift it up. Max clamp height is 76”/194cm, plenty high to get eye-level access to suspension or drivetrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_head-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_head-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Feedback Pro E Lift electric assist home bicycle repair stand for ebikes, clamp detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_head-detail.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_head-detail-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_head-detail-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_head-detail-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_head-detail-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_head-detail-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Feedback)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The e-assist work stand features the familiar and easy-to-use Feedback Speed Ratchet + Spinner Knob clamp. There’s the big dial to tighten the clamp on your bike, and QR button to fully open the jaws in an instant. And the jaw covers are replaceable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Built for performance ebikes the Feedback Pro E Lift repair stand has a maximum solace / 50kg lift capacity. Feedback offers US and EU AC power supplies, for 100-127V 5A or 220-240V 2A max power draw.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Feedback Pro E Lift repair stand – Pricing and availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_studio.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_studio.jpg\" alt=\"Feedback Pro E Lift electric assist home bicycle repair stand for ebikes, complete\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_studio.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_studio-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_studio-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_studio-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feedback-Pro-E-Lift-electric-assist-home-bicycle-repair-stand-for-ebikes_studio-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Feedback)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pricing is a big key to making the Feedback Pro E Lift repair stand a viable solution for home mechanics or even for small bike shops on the fence about a powered work stand. Feedback will sell the Pro E Lift for $1200 / 1350€. And availability is slated for the beginning of next year – January 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, that’s pretty pricey for an at home mechanic. But when we routinely see top-tier e-bikes selling in the $10-15,000€, it seems feasible that some of those tech-savvy ebike buyers would appreciate an equally hi-tech stand to make home maintenance easier. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll be able to get the new Feedback Pro E Lift through your local independent bike shop (where you may even see one in use) or direct from Feedback. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://feedbacksports.com\"><em>FeedbackSports.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/feedback-sports-pro-e-lift-repair-stand-gives-home-emtb-mechanics-a-hand-up/\">Feedback Sports Pro E Lift Repair Stand Gives Home eMTB Mechanics a Hand Up</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"e76a5d3ea257c25381cfe605d5470b57a34208b581243b26e241ca0914641c38","category":"Cycling"}
