Today's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> announcement was heavily focused on the Mac's Apple Intelligence features, and Apple has also shared two new Apple Intelligence ads.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nApple's first ad shows off Writing Tools, featuring an office worker who sends an email and uses the \"Professional\" rewriting feature to make it sound less casual. The well-crafted email impresses his boss.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nThe second ad features a woman who forgot it was her husband's birthday, so she whips up a quick Memory Movie slideshow on her <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> as a gift.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth Writing Tools and Memory Movies  in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> app are new features that are available on devices running iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, or ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.1.
