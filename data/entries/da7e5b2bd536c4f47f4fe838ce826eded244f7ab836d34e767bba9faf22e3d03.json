In Los Angeles County, masks are once again required, so Apple employees in this area will indeed be wearing masks.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAll Apple stores worldwide are still open at this point in time, and it is not clear if there will be further shutdowns in any areas.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple had planned to have its corporate employees return to work in September, but yesterday said that those plans <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/apple-delays-return-to-offices/\">have been delayed</a> until October at the earliest.
