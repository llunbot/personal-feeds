{"title":"How to fix a Microsoft Outlook login that won’t work due to local port conflicts on your Mac","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/1942760/fix-outlook-login-mac-port-conflict.html","date":1689325200000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you connect to Outlook via a Mac email client and your organization requires a fresh login after a certain number of days set by its security policy, you might find yourself mysteriously stymied and be unable to troubleshoot the problem if you hit the same snag I did recently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After years of receiving weekly requests to perform a login and two-factor authentication via my browser for an Outlook account, it suddenly failed. No amount of troubleshooting seemed to allow me to reconnect. Strangely, on a different Mac, authentication continued to work without a hitch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a substantial amount of trial and error, I discovered a new piece of software that I had installed interfered with my email client’s browser launch. The new software, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/607430/peakhour-review-mac-gems.html\">PeakHour</a>, operates a tiny local web server to manage some information gathering about your Mac’s data usage. As with all internet-based servers, it requires a port number–a unique number that identifies a particular service on any internet-connected device, like email, secure web browser, and the like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In trying to troubleshoot an unrelated network problem, I had installed PeakHour, which enabled its server at port 8000. What I didn’t realize (and you can’t find documented anywhere) is that either Outlook or some email client use port 8000 to create a short-lived local web server to manage the authentication with Microsoft’s Outlook login systems. Because my email client couldn’t launch a web page at port 8000–the PeakHour page came up instead–it failed to authenticate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most software that creates a local web server also has the option to change the number. I changed it from 8000 to 8002, restarted PeakHour, and was immediately able to get my Outlook email account working again. Check the settings for the software for such an option.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
