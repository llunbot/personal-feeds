Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos' space company, urged the federal government to consider capping the number of Starship launches and landings, test-firings, and other operations, and limiting SpaceX's activities to particular times.</p>\n<p>Elon Musk, founder and CEO of SpaceX, called Blue Origin's filing with the FAA \"an obviously disingenuous response. Not cool of them to try (for the third time) to impede SpaceX’s progress by lawfare.\" We'll get to that in a moment.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035078#p3\">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035078&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fb5940f57b44ce8bdf1655b3507d138e9b3af1f0ac439d8ac345aa3047f20aa7","category":"Tech"}
