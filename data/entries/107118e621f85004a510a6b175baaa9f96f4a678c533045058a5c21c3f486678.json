{"title":"The Other Memory-Holed Episode of ‘The Simpsons’ — the One With Michael Jackson","link":"https://slate.com/culture/2019/03/simpsons-michael-jackson-stark-raving-dad-pulled.html","date":1638487403000,"content":"\n<p>Small bit of follow-up regarding <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/12/01/disney-plus-simpsons-tiananmen-square\">yesterday’s item</a> about Disney+ blocking an episode of <em>The Simpsons</em> in Hong Kong because it contained a joke about Tiananmen Square. The article I linked to at The Wrap claimed “Disney+ users in the U.S. may be able to stream every episode of ‘The Simpsons’ ever made,” but that’s not true. Here’s Isaac Butler, writing for Slate two years ago:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One unexpected fallout from our cultural reckoning with the life\nand work of Michael Jackson is <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2019/03/michael-jackson-simpsons-episode-featuring-singers-voice-to-be-pulled-from-circulation.html\">the erasure of a <em>Simpsons</em>\nepisode</a>. “Stark Raving Dad,” the premiere of the show’s\nthird season, tells the story of Homer being committed to an\ninsane asylum, where he meets a patient named Leon Kompowsky, who\nclaims to be Michael Jackson. Homer, not knowing who Michael\nJackson is, believes him. Antics ensue. The central joke is that\nLeon is actually voiced by Michael Jackson, a joke extended\nfurther by his use of a pseudonym in the end credits. Following\nthe renewed <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2019/02/michael-jackson-leaving-neverland-cancel-culture-metoo.html\">allegations of child sexual abuse</a> against\nJackson, executive producer James L. Brooks announced last week\nthat <em>The Simpsons</em> will no longer include the episode in\nsyndication packages, streaming, or even future DVD releases of\nthe show. It’s gone. But don’t call it a book burning, he\ncautions. “This is our book,” he told the Wall Street Journal,\n“and we’re allowed to take out a chapter.” [...]</p>\n\n<p>“Stark Raving Dad” is not the golden age’s best episode, but it is\nthe shot across the bow. In its absurd plotting and metatextual\njapery, its alchemical mixture of cynicism and heartwarming\nsentiment — to say nothing of the way it reckons with its guest\ncelebrity’s public image — it establishes the formula that the\nshow was to follow for years. The episode belongs in a museum — preserved forever, not swept into the memory hole.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There was also a years-long stretch after 9/11 where the season premiere of season 9 — “The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson” — was held from syndication because a segment takes place at the World Trade Center. It’s been back in syndication and streaming since 2006, though. They should do the same with “Stark Raving Dad”.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/12/02/the-simpsons-michael-jackson\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"107118e621f85004a510a6b175baaa9f96f4a678c533045058a5c21c3f486678","category":"Tech"}
