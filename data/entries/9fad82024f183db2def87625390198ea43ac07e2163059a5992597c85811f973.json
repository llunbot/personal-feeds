Made by hand one-at-a-time to an exacting level of attention to detail in Europe, these limited edition Masterpiece carbon frames truly are a work of art for bike nerds like us. But shockingly enough, this Teammachine R Mpc frameset is actually more affordable than when BMC introduced us to their masterpiece collection a couple of years ago…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>BMC Teammachine R Mpc ltd. edition carbon aero road bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BMC-Teammachine-R-Mpc-limited-edition-premium-carbon-aero-road-bike_riding-a-masterpiece-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BMC-Teammachine-R-Mpc-limited-edition-premium-carbon-aero-road-bike_riding-a-masterpiece-jpg.webp\" alt=\"BMC Teammachine R Mpc limited edition premium carbon aero road bike, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BMC-Teammachine-R-Mpc-limited-edition-premium-carbon-aero-road-bike_riding-a-masterpiece-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BMC-Teammachine-R-Mpc-limited-edition-premium-carbon-aero-road-bike_riding-a-masterpiece-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BMC-Teammachine-R-Mpc-limited-edition-premium-carbon-aero-road-bike_riding-a-masterpiece-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BMC-Teammachine-R-Mpc-limited-edition-premium-carbon-aero-road-bike_riding-a-masterpiece-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BMC-Teammachine-R-Mpc-limited-edition-premium-carbon-aero-road-bike_riding-a-masterpiece-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/BMC)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Masterpiece is BMC’s vision of the perfect carbon bike. This is the result of their Swiss engineers geeking out on the highest-performance carbon material, the most precise layup, and the most advanced molds. However, it is not an efficient process suitable for production bikes. So instead, they build one frame at a time, sparing no expense. BMC create what they describe as “a work of art” in carbon, without paint or filler to hide the beautiful raw carbon fiber work.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It takes too long to make each one. We can’t make very many. They will be too expensive. It’s unnecessary. But we can.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BMC-Teammachine-R-Mpc-limited-edition-premium-carbon-aero-road-bike_a-masterpiece-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BMC-Teammachine-R-Mpc-limited-edition-premium-carbon-aero-road-bike_a-masterpiece-jpg.webp\" alt=\"BMC Teammachine R Mpc limited edition premium carbon aero road bike, top tube detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BMC-Teammachine-R-Mpc-limited-edition-premium-carbon-aero-road-bike_a-masterpiece-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BMC-Teammachine-R-Mpc-limited-edition-premium-carbon-aero-road-bike_a-masterpiece-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BMC-Teammachine-R-Mpc-limited-edition-premium-carbon-aero-road-bike_a-masterpiece-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BMC-Teammachine-R-Mpc-limited-edition-premium-carbon-aero-road-bike_a-masterpiece-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BMC-Teammachine-R-Mpc-limited-edition-premium-carbon-aero-road-bike_a-masterpiece-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BMC-Teammachine-R-Mpc-limited-edition-premium-carbon-aero-road-bike_a-masterpiece-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, with a new Teammachine R to work from, BMC recreate a more premium Teammachine R Mpc.

Maintaining all those other critical factors for maximum speed at the same elite level? That’s nearly miraculous.
