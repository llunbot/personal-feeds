When the 80% hard limit is enabled, the iPhone will never charge past that point whatsoever.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn all iPhone 15 models, there are three options under Settings → Battery → Battery Health &amp; Charging → Charging Optimization:<ul><li>Optimized Battery Charging</li>\r<br />\n<li>80% Limit</li>\r<br />\n<li>None</li></ul>As with Optimized Battery Charging, the 80% hard limit can improve an iPhone battery's lifespan by reducing the time that the battery is fully charged.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new setting was previously discovered in iOS 17 code by software researcher <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevemoser\">Steve Moser</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says all of the iPhone 15 models have the same battery life as iPhone 14 models.
