There are no new features and the update seemingly contains just a single patch. However, Apple appears to have pulled the update just a few hours after it was pushed to the general public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213823&amp;xcust=1-1-1986514-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple’s security page</a> describes the flaw:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WebKit</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Available for:</strong> iOS 16.5.1 and iPadOS 16.5.1 and macOS Ventura 13.4.1</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Processing web content may lead to arbitrary code execution. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Description:</strong> The issue was addressed with improved checks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CVE-2023-37450:</strong> an anonymous researcher</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, there’s a way for bad actors to create web content that can make your iPhone, iPad, or Mac run whatever they want. And this flaw seems to have already been used in the wild, hence the emergency need for the patch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Twitter user Aaron, who closely tracks Apple’s software updates, Apple temporarily pulled the update after users reported that it “broke certain apps such as Facebook, Instagram, Zoom to name a few.” We checked an iPhone that hadn’t yet installed the update and it no longer appeared in the Software Update tab.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Apple has pulled the Rapid Security Responses released earlier today.<br /><br />There are reports on the MacRumors forums that it broke certain apps such as Facebook, Instagram, Zoom to name a few.</p>— Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1678603028113289217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-1986514-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">July 11, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple pushed its <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1922298/ios-macos-rapid-security-response-webkit-flaw-safari-zero-day.html\">first Rapid Security Response update</a> in May for iOS 16.4, iPadOS 16.4, and macOS 13.3, though it didn’t divulge the contents until a couple of weeks later. So it’s possible that this update contains other fixes that Apple isn’t declaring yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To update your device when it reappears, go to the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad, tap <em>General</em>, then <em>Software Update</em>, and then <em>Download and Install</em>. On your Mac, head over to <em>System Settings</em>, then select <em>General</em> and <em>Software Update</em>.</p>\n\niOS, MacOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"cf1222edc146be0d6d17daa182db98f20f387ff5fb8372b56129ad11c473fd11","category":"Apple"}
