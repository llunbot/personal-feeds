Samsung has also included Dynamic Thermal Guard technology to protect against overheating.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe SSD measures in at 3.74 inches in length and 1.57 inches in width, and it weighs 3.6 ounces, so it is portable and ideal for travel.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe 8TB version of the T5 EVO SSD is priced at $650, and it can be <a href=\"https://howl.me/ck0j1XGvcAW\">purchased from the Samsung website</a>.
