{"title":"Fox News Dumps Tucker Carlson","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/04/24/business/tucker-carlson-fox-news#tucker-carlson-fox-news","date":1682363912000,"content":"\n<p>The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Fox News said Monday that it was parting ways with Tucker\nCarlson, its most popular prime time host who was also the\nsource of repeated controversies and headaches for the network\nbecause of his statements on everything from race relations to\nL.G.B.T.Q. rights.</p>\n\n<p>The network made the announcement less than a week after it agreed\nto pay $787.5 million in a defamation lawsuit in which Mr.\nCarlson’s show, one of the highest rated on Fox, figured\nprominently for its role in spreading misinformation after the\n2020 election.</p>\n\n<p>In making its announcement, Fox <a href=\"https://press.foxnews.com/2023/04/fox-news-media-and-tucker-carlson-part-ways\">offered a terse statement</a>\nof gratitude. “Fox News Media and Tucker Carlson have agreed to\npart ways. We thank him for his service to the network as a host\nand prior to that as a contributor,” it said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1650525732819423234\">Aaron Rupar</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Here was the end of what turned out to be Tucker Carlson’s final\nFox News show last Friday. Certainly no indication that he didn’t\nexpect to be on the air tonight. In fact Tucker’s final words are,\n“We’ll be back on Monday.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1650533995036246016\">Brian Stelter</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Let’s make one thing very clear: Tucker Carlson did not choose to\nleave Fox News like this. Others can decide whether the word\n“fired” applies here, but he isn’t leaving on his own terms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems like it’s unlikely to be a complete coincidence that Fox News settled the Dominion lawsuit for nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars, but odious though Carlson may be, he wasn’t really at the forefront of Fox’s election lies. <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-03-09/fox-news-anchor-maria-bartiromo-dominion-defamation-suit-murdoch-trump-election-2020-carlson\">Maria Bartiromo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/judge-in-dominions-defamation-case-suggests-fox-news-has-a-lou-dobbs-problem\">Lou Dobbs</a> were — and they’re both still employed at Fox.</p>\n\n<p>Some people are speculating that it might be acquiescence to The Boss in Mar-a-Lago, after text messages uncovered in the Dominion suit revealed Carlson writing to colleagues, of Trump, “<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/08/carlson-on-trump\">I hate him passionately</a>.” But if Trump had a grudge against Carlson, why did he do an interview on Carlson’s show just two weeks ago?</p>\n\n<p>Makes me think something else is going on. Maybe some sort of harassment situation? Or maybe the Murdochs figured <em>someone</em> had to be fired, and it might as well be the guy who’s too big for his britches?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> The LA Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>People familiar with the situation who were not authorized to\ncomment publicly said the decision to fire Carlson came straight\nfrom Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch. Carlson’s exit is related\nto the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-03-27/fired-fox-news-producer-said-she-was-coached-by-network-lawyers-on-defamation-case-testimony\">discrimination lawsuit filed by Abby Grossberg</a>,\nthe producer fired by the network last month, the people said.\nCarlson’s senior executive producer Justin Wells has also been\nterminated, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/24/tucker-carlson-fox-dumped\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6014f8681888f03d58fa81d4bcd8e92289eb1d18e3c36b17089e6d6836c5f2de","category":"Tech"}
