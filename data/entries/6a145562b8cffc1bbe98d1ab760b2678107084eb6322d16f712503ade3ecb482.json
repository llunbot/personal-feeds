Relatedly, lots of business-minded webapps use Google's OAuth, i.e. \"Sign in with Google.\" It's a low-friction feedback loop—up until the startup fails, the domain goes up for sale, and somebody forgot to close down all the Google stuff.</p>\n<p>Dylan Ayrey, of Truffle Security Co., <a href=\"https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/millions-at-risk-due-to-google-s-oauth-flaw\">suggests in a report</a> that this problem is more serious than anyone, especially Google, is acknowledging. Many startups make the critical mistake of not properly closing their accounts—on both Google and other web-based apps—before letting their domains expire.</p>\n<p>Given the number of people working for tech startups (6 million), the failure rate of said startups (90 percent), their usage of Google Workspaces (50 percent, all by Ayrey's numbers), and the speed at which startups tend to fall apart, there are a lot of Google-auth-connected domains up for sale at any time. That would not be an inherent problem, except that, as Ayrey shows, buying a domain with a still-active Google account can let you re-activate the Google accounts for former employees.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/startup-necromancy-dead-google-apps-domains-can-be-compromised-by-new-owners/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/startup-necromancy-dead-google-apps-domains-can-be-compromised-by-new-owners/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6a145562b8cffc1bbe98d1ab760b2678107084eb6322d16f712503ade3ecb482","category":"Tech"}
