What’s fastest for one rider and their position on the bike, may not be fastest for the next.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Stephen Roche (The Bike Tailor) directing Liam Cahill in the Silverstone Sports Engineering Hub wind tunnel\" title=\"Best value aero upgrades\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Many aero helmets are designed to work best when riding in aggressive positions.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Joseph Branston / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If you really want to know which is fastest for you, then, it will likely require heading to a wind tunnel or velodrome for some aero testing to find out.</p>\n<p>Failing that, we’d suggest not worrying about it too much.</p>\n<p>For day-to-day riding, the marginal aerodynamic differences between aero helmets don’t matter as much as factors such as comfort and ventilation, which we’ve focused on here.</p>\n<h2>What to consider when buying an aero helmet</h2>\n<p>As with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aero-road-bike/\">aero road bikes</a>, it’s worth considering that aerodynamic efficiency isn’t the be all and end all of helmet performance.</p>\n<p>It’s important, of course, but factors such as comfort, ventilation, weight and safety shouldn’t be overlooked either.</p>\n<h3>Aerodynamics</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Evade 3 helmet\" title=\"Specialized Evade 3 helmet\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Specialized Evade 3 has an elongated shape designed to help smooth the airflow over your head.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / BikeRadar</i></span></div>\n<p>Aerodynamically optimised helmets tend to achieve efficiency via a few common methods.</p>\n<p>Helmets such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/helmets/road-cycling-helmets/specialized-s-works-evade-3-helmet-review/\">Specialized Evade 3</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/new-trek-ballista-velocis/\">Trek Ballista</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/abus-gamechanger-2/\">ABUS GameChanger 2.0</a> are all shaped to act like truncated (or ‘Kammtail’) aerofoils, for example.</p>\n<p>As with aero frame tubes, or deep-section aero rims, the idea is that these shapes are aerodynamically efficient by nature.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lazer Vento KinetiCore helmet\" title=\"Lazer Vento KinetiCore helmet\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> As with many aero helmets, Lazer’s Vento KinetiCore features minimal venting up front. Another tactic is to close off ventilation holes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Ventilation holes typically cause drag as they allow air to flow through the helmet and on to your head, where it stalls and things get messy.</p>\n<p>This is ideal for keeping your head cool, of course, but closing off these vents can help to direct the airflow over your head more smoothly. In turn, this can help reduce drag.</p>\n<p>Some helmets also include one or two small aero tricks, aimed at reducing drag even further.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Trek Ballista helmet\" title=\"Trek Ballista helmet\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Trek’s Ballista features a trip line, which is claimed to serve an aerodynamic purpose.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Trek Ballista, for example, has a ‘trip line’ running horizontally across the midsection of its outer shell.</p>\n<p>Like the dimples on a golf ball, this is claimed to reduce drag by tripping the airflow from laminar (smooth) to turbulent (rough) at an optimal point.</p>\n<p>In theory, this helps the airflow to stay attached to the helmet for longer and reduces the size of the trailing low-pressure wake.</p>\n<h3>Ventilation</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Simon von Bromley riding a Giant TCR\" title=\"13-49-01_SNY0451\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> On hot days, compromising on ventilation might not be ideal.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you ride somewhere where the weather is generally cooler, or you do a lot of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/complete-guide-to-winter-road-cycling/\">winter cycling</a>, then less ventilation might be a welcome thing.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you’ve ever <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cycling-in-hot-weather/\">ridden your bike in hot weather</a>, then you’ll likely be aware that staying cool and comfortable is critical to performance.</p>\n<p>For this reason, ventilation is a key consideration for any helmet – be it aero-optimised or not.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Evade 3 helmet front\" title=\"Specialized Evade 3 helmet\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Ventilation holes on aero helmets are carefully sized and positioned to avoid adding too much drag.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / BikeRadar</i></span></div>\n<p>As already discussed, this can pose a problem for aero helmets because adding ventilation holes is usually detrimental to aerodynamic performance.</p>\n<p>Time trial helmets typically feature very minimal venting for this reason.</p>\n<p>In contrast, the best aero road helmets strike a balance between aerodynamic efficiency and ventilation.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lazer Vento KinetiCore helmet\" title=\"Lazer Vento KinetiCore helmet\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Most aero helmets feature intricate internal channelling to try to allow air to flow through them and keep your head cool.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>In our experience, most modern aero helmets offer excellent cooling at higher speeds, when air flow through the minimalist venting is strong.</p>\n<p>Conversely, many can struggle at slower speeds, when airflow through the helmet is reduced and the relatively closed outer shell makes thermal radiation more difficult.</p>\n<p>This is why we often see pros at the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/tour-de-france-bikes/\">Tour de France</a> using vented helmets for hot days in the mountains.</p>\n<div>\n    <img

Media</i></span></div>\n<h3>Weight</h3>\n<p>Fewer vents and a greater amount of aerodynamic shaping also tends to mean an increase in the amount of material used in the construction of aero helmets.</p>\n<p>As a result, aero helmets are typically heavier than vented equivalents.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Simon von Bromley in BikeRadar kit riding a Giant TCR up a climb\" title=\"16-54-48_SNY0526\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> If you’re a fan of hill climb racing, every gram might count, but otherwise it’s generally not something worth worrying about.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>For most riders, though, a few tens of grams here or there isn’t likely to make much, if any, noticeable difference to performance.</p>\n<p>With most of the best aero road helmets coming in under 300g for a size medium, weight usually isn’t an issue for all but the most dedicated weight weenies or <a

aero helmet’s primary job is to provide adequate protection for your head.</p>\n<p>While all of the helmets listed here meet or exceed the minimum required international safety standards (EN-1078 in the UK and EU or CPSC 1203 in the US), many will go above and beyond this level of protection.</p>\n<p>Some helmets, for example, use alternative core materials, such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/helmets/road-cycling-helmets/smith-optics-ignite-mips-helmet-review/\">Koroyd</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/helmets/road-cycling-helmets/bontrager-xxx-wavecel-road-helmet-review/\">WaveCel</a>, in place of (or in tandem with) standard EPS (Expanded Polystyrene) foam in certain areas.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Trek Ballista helmet\" title=\"Trek Ballista helmet\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Like many other high-end helmets,

impacts are also increasingly common.</p>\n<p>Many helmets now include technology such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-mips/\">MIPS liners</a>, for example, while other brands have devised their own internal testing protocols (such as Kask’s WG11 certification), with the aim of ensuring their helmets offer enhanced protection beyond the basic legal requirements.</p>","author":"Jack
