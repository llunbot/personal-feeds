With no USB data port to force Recovery Mode and no software solution, if you were locked out of your Vision Pro during the first two weeks, there wasn’t much you could do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Apple has released visionOS 1.0.3 with a fix for this problem. The update doesn’t include any security patches and Apple’s release notes are spartan:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This update provides important bug fixes and adds an option to reset your device if you’ve forgotten your passcode.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Should you type in the wrong passcode several times, you’ll be locked out, but now will have the option to reset your device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activation Lock will still be enabled, so while you’ll start fresh from the setup process, you’ll only be able to set up your Apple Vision Pro with the same Apple ID you had on it already. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to update your Apple Vision Pro</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You update your visionOS software the same way as most Apple devices. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open Settings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select <em>General</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select <em>Software Update</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest software update will be shown, as well as options to download and install it. If you don’t see it, you can drag the menu downward to refresh it.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/visionos-update.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"visionOS update\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/visionos-update.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1330w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/visionos-update.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/visionos-update.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/visionos-update.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/visionos-update.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/visionos-update.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\nVirtual Reality</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"621c921da2386db8f3734068f3763bf3262f0d338bb50f5ecd567e917c722fed","category":"Apple"}
