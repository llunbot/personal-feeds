But if you wanted to run 6-bolt rotors, you simply clip the stainless steel collet around the groove found behind the Centerlock section, then slide the adapter plate over that, like so:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-hub-centerlock-to-6-bolt-integration-07.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"376\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-hub-centerlock-to-6-bolt-integration-07-800x376.jpg\" alt=\"project 321 G3 hubs with all-in-one centerlock and 6-bolt brake rotor design\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-hub-centerlock-to-6-bolt-integration-07-800x376.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-hub-centerlock-to-6-bolt-integration-07-297x140.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-hub-centerlock-to-6-bolt-integration-07-120x56.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-hub-centerlock-to-6-bolt-integration-07-768x361.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-hub-centerlock-to-6-bolt-integration-07-1536x723.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-hub-centerlock-to-6-bolt-integration-07-2048x964.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They say all Centerlock hubs have a groove behind the toothed rotor interface (though it may not be in a standardized position, so these adapters may not work on other hub shells) that’s just part of the manufacturing design specificifactions…it allows for material clearing during machining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stainless steel collet has a split in it, allowing you to spread it slightly to slide it over the teeth and clip it into place. The adapter then slides over it and locks it into place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They call it 6 Lock, and the benefit over standard 6-bolt hubs is that if you ever strip a thread or bolt, you can just replace the clip ring, leaving your expensive hub and already-built wheel perfectly intact. But because it’s stainless steel, and not aluminum, it’s unlikely you’ll strip the threads and it provides a stronger interface for the rotor bolts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-hub-centerlock-to-6-bolt-integration-08.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"527\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-hub-centerlock-to-6-bolt-integration-08-800x527.jpg\" alt=\"project 321 G3 hubs with all-in-one centerlock and 6-bolt brake rotor design\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-hub-centerlock-to-6-bolt-integration-08-800x527.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-hub-centerlock-to-6-bolt-integration-08-297x196.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-hub-centerlock-to-6-bolt-integration-08-120x79.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-hub-centerlock-to-6-bolt-integration-08-768x506.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-hub-centerlock-to-6-bolt-integration-08-1536x1013.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-hub-centerlock-to-6-bolt-integration-08.jpg 1820w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is a seamless appearance that’s also color-matched to your hub.

So, with only two pawls engaging at a time, Project 321 needed to have a very robust system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they partnered with Stan’s to design a stronger axle that gets dual double-row bearings inside. One sides on the hubshell side, the other under the freehub body, both directly next to each other directly underneath the pawls and drive ring.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-e-MTB-hub-01.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-e-MTB-hub-01-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"internal view of magnetic pawls and ratchet ring for Project 321 3-bike hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-e-MTB-hub-01-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-e-MTB-hub-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-e-MTB-hub-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-e-MTB-hub-01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-e-MTB-hub-01-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/project-321-v3-e-MTB-hub-01.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For e-bikes (and, presumably, tandems), they’re working on a prototype titanium freehub body that flips the numbers to two teams of four pawls engaging at any point. This reduces engagement slightly to 2.5º with 144 POE. It also adds an extra single-row bearing on the outboard drive side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Target price is $650/set, likely available in late May or June in Boost and Superboost. Claimed weights are 155g (front) and 292g (rear) without the adapters, and 175g (front) and 312g (rear) with the 6 Lock parts onboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re looking at a complete clean sheet design for road and gravel hubs to make them a lot lighter, with distinct designs for each, but no word on when those might come out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://project321.com\" target=\"_blank\">Project321.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-project-321-hubs-get-slick-centerlock-plus-6-bolt-design-tougher-axles/\">New Project 321 hubs get slick Centerlock-plus-6 Bolt design &amp; tougher axles</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"9a623e6b2b9f4ee4c6ead57a7d9219120ed0aea804f2538f8c1d0d0aa7e5a278","category":"Cycling"}
