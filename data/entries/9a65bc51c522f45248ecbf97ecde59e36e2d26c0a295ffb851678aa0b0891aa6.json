You still have time to donate to a good cause and get a chance to win your share of over $1,600 worth of swag (no purchase necessary to win).</p>\n<p>So far this year, after just over three days, nearly 100 readers have donated nearly $9,000 to either the <a href=\"https://supporters.eff.org/donate/\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> or <a href=\"http://www.childsplaycharity.org/\">Child's Play</a> as part of the charity drive (Child's Play is leading in the donation totals by about $1,100, FWIW). That's a long way off from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/ars-readers-gave-a-record-58000-in-2020-charity-drive/\">last year's record haul of over $58,000</a>, but there's still plenty of time until the Charity Drive wraps up on Jan. 7, 2022.</p>\n<p>That doesn't mean you should put your donation off, though. Do yourself and the charities involved a favor and give now, while you're thinking about it. Don't let it slip your mind and end up kicking yourself in January for not taking part.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1821590#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1821590&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9a65bc51c522f45248ecbf97ecde59e36e2d26c0a295ffb851678aa0b0891aa6","category":"Tech"}
