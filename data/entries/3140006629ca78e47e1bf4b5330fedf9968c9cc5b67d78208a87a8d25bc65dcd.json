So a certain degree of ingenuity is required to get usable results—like crocheting adorable little hats for kitties taking part in <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/electroencephalogram-eeg\">electroencephalogram</a> (EEG) experiments. That's what researchers at the University of Montreal in Quebec, Canada, did to learn more about assessing chronic pain in cats—and they succeeded. According to their <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027024001997?via%3Dihub\">recent paper</a> published in the Journal of Neuroscience Methods, it's the first time scientists have recorded the electrical activity in the brains of conscious cats.</p>\n<p>According to the authors, one-quarter of adult cats suffer from osteoarthritis and chronic pain that worsens with age. There are currently limited treatment options, namely, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which can have significant side effects for the cats. An injectable monoclonal antibody tailored for cats has recently been developed to neutralize excessive nerve growth factor, but other alternative treatment options like supplements and regenerative medicine have yet to be tested. Nor has the effectiveness of certain smells or lighting in altering pain perception in felines been tested.</p>\n<p>That was the Montreal team's primary objective for their experiments. Initially, they tried to place electrodes on the heads of 11 awake adult cats with osteoarthritis, but the cats kept shaking off the electrodes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052375#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052375&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3140006629ca78e47e1bf4b5330fedf9968c9cc5b67d78208a87a8d25bc65dcd","category":"Tech"}
