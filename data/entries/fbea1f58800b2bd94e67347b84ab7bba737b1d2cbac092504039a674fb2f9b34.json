Admitting that the court \"has no objective understanding as to how Copilot works,\" Schopf suggested that the legal system could be disrupted if experts started overly relying on chatbots en masse.</p>\n<p>His warning came after an expert witness, Charles Ranson, dubiously used Copilot to cross-check calculations in a dispute over a $485,000 rental property in the Bahamas that had been included in a trust for a deceased man's son. The court was being asked to assess if the executrix and trustee—the deceased man's sister—breached her fiduciary duties by delaying the sale of the property while admittedly using it for personal vacations.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/judge-confronts-expert-witness-who-used-copilot-to-fake-expertise/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/judge-confronts-expert-witness-who-used-copilot-to-fake-expertise/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fbea1f58800b2bd94e67347b84ab7bba737b1d2cbac092504039a674fb2f9b34","category":"Tech"}
