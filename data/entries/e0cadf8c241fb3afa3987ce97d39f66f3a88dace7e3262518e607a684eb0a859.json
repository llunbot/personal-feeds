{"title":"Gmail gains Gemini-powered “Add to calendar” button","link":"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/gmail-gains-gemini-powered-add-to-calendar-button/","date":1741636164000,"content":"<p>Google has a new mission in the AI era: to add Gemini to as many of the company's products as possible. We've already seen Gemini appear in search results, text messages, and more. In Google's latest update to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/google-increases-workspace-plan-base-prices-while-adding-gemini-features/\">Workspace</a>, Gemini will be able to add calendar appointments from Gmail with a single click. Well, assuming Gemini gets it right the first time, which is far from certain.</p>\n<p>The new calendar button will appear at the top of emails, right next to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/gmails-ai-powered-email-summaries-can-dig-through-your-inbox-for-you/\">summarize button</a> that arrived last year. The calendar option will show up in Gmail threads with actionable meeting chit-chat, allowing you to mash that button to create an appointment in one step. The Gemini sidebar will open to confirm the appointment was made, which is a good opportunity to double-check the robot. There will be a handy edit button in the Gemini window in the event it makes a mistake. However, the robot can't invite people to these events yet.</p>\n<p>The effect of using the button is the same as opening the Gemini panel and asking it to create an appointment. The new functionality is simply detecting events and offering the button as a shortcut of sorts. You should not expect to see this button appear on messages that already have calendar integration, like dining reservations and flights. Those already pop up in Google Calendar without AI.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/gmail-gains-gemini-powered-add-to-calendar-button/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/gmail-gains-gemini-powered-add-to-calendar-button/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e0cadf8c241fb3afa3987ce97d39f66f3a88dace7e3262518e607a684eb0a859","category":"Tech"}
