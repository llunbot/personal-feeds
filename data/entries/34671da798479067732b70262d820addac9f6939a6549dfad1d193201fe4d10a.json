It is the most matte display type that Apple makes, and Apple claims that it is useful for high-end, color-managed workflows or demanding ambient lighting environments.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<blockquote>The new MacBook Pro introduces an all-new nano-texture display option that dramatically reduces glare and distractions from reflections. In bright lighting conditions, the new MacBook Pro can now show SDR content at up to 1,000 nits and still displays HDR content at up to 1,600 nits of peak brightness. All together, it’s a game-changing experience for users working outdoors.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this week, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/nano-texture-display-returns-to-imac/\">reintroduced</a> the nano-texture display option to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a>'s nano-texture glass is a build-to-order option that costs $150, configurable at the point of purchase.
