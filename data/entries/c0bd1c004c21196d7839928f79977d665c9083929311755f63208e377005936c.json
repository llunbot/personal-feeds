But Jones’ interest was piqued because there were pages of the text that <em>no one</em> had succeeded in reading.</p>\n<p>Those pages remained unread until this year when a large part of the text was deciphered by Jones, a professor of history of the exact sciences in antiquity at New York University, who worked with Victor Gysembergh and Emanuel Zingg of the Paris-based Léon Robin Centre.
