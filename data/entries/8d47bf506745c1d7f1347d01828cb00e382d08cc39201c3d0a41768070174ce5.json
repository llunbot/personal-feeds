The show has officially been announced for January 17, with Samsung's <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/the-next-galaxy/reserve/\">reservation website</a> promising \"Zoom with Galaxy AI is coming.\" Of course, 2023 was the year of generative AI, and Samsung's interest in the technology is a safe bet.</p>\n<p>The show will launch the Galaxy S24, which has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/galaxy-s24-leaks-show-samsungs-usual-love-for-the-iphone/\">already leaked</a> quite a bit, with the big news being a new titanium body. The iPhone made titanium the hot new thing recently with the launch of the iPhone 15, and Samsung has taken notice. The best leak so far has been from <a href=\"https://windowsreport.com/exclusive-images-galaxy-s24-lineup-gets-ai-flat-screen-new-colors-titanium-build/\">Windows Report</a>, which scored official press images of the phones. (The report is no longer online due to a DMCA takedown, which is a good sign of its legitimacy.)</p>\n<p>The Windows Report photos showed the smaller Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus are getting flat metal sides, reminiscent of the classic iPhone 4/iPhone 15 design. Samsung's usual design of rounded corners and individual camera lenses complete the phone design, and while they look nice, they also look a lot like an iPhone. Older leaks claimed these two cheaper phones were getting titanium bodies, but well-known Samsung leaker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1710247896124395768\">Ice Universe</a> says only the bigger model will be titanium, and these cheaper models will be aluminum.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993482#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993482&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8d47bf506745c1d7f1347d01828cb00e382d08cc39201c3d0a41768070174ce5","category":"Tech"}
