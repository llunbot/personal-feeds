Tile isn't going to take it lying down, though, and has introduced a <a href=\"https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/blog/all-new-tile-bluetooth-trackers-finders-2021\" target=\"_blank\">refreshed lineup</a> of Bluetooth tracker products that help you find your stuff. Tile's advantage over its Big Tech rivals is that it has the only platform-agnostic product line. So if you're not exclusively in Apple's or Samsung's ecosystem and are always losing your car keys, Tile is worth looking at.</p>\n<p></p><div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/24.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/24-300x522.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/24.jpg\">The back of the Tile Pro, if you're wondering where the battery goes.</a> (credit: Tile)</p></div>The <a href=\"https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/store/tiles/pro\" target=\"_blank\">$34.99 Tile Pro</a>, Tile's one product with a user-replaceable battery, has a new, longer design that Tile says is modeled after a key fob. With more space, you get a better speaker and a 400-foot Bluetooth range. It <a href=\"https://tileteam.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009446833-How-do-I-replace-a-battery-\" target=\"_blank\">still takes</a> a CR2032 battery (aka a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonvolatile_BIOS_memory\" target=\"_blank\">BIOS battery</a>) that Tile says should last for a year.\n<p>The other Tile products have permanent batteries that Tile says should last for three years. After that, you'll need to replace the trackers. There's the <a href=\"https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/store/tiles/mate\" target=\"_blank\">$24.99 Tile Mate</a> (Tile's cheaper key-chain tracker), the <a href=\"https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/store/tiles/slim\" target=\"_blank\">$34.99 Tile Slim</a> (a tracker shaped like a credit card for your wallet), and the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3DLYNDT\" target=\"_blank\">$29.99 Tile Sticker</a> (a small plastic circle with sticky tape) for items where a loop connector isn't viable. The range of these three items has been upgraded to 250 feet, which Tile says is \"an increase of 25% for Mate and Slim and a 67% increase for Sticker.\" Every new tracker, including the Pro, has IP67 dust and water resistance, so they should survive being submerged in a meter of water for 30 minutes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804165#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804165&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"241674b5e47c5338e36886b7c5922ea32371e0ff19a6b3dbab5458dedf27b76e","category":"Tech"}
