Set side by side with the outgoing Gen 4, only a few of the new Gen 5 bike’s features might jump out at you. But being built in the UK for effectively the same price as before, Cotic will be able to build you up your own perfect trail bike quicker than ever. Developed in South Yorkshire and then fabricated just a half-a-workday’s drive up the road in Edinburgh, Scotland, this steel &amp; alloy FlareMAX marks the first production full-suspension bike to be made entirely in the UK by Cotic’s partners at Five Land Bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_trail-center-recovery.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_trail-center-recovery-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Cotic FlareMAX Gen5, 125mm steel full-suspension trail bike, made-in-the-UK, photo by Richard Baybutt, trail centre beer post-ride recovery\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_trail-center-recovery-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_trail-center-recovery-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_trail-center-recovery-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_trail-center-recovery-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_trail-center-recovery-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_trail-center-recovery.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, 100% UK manufacturing is big news – previously Five Land Bikes built several of Cotic’s premium steel front triangles and small batch bikes, while rear ends and most production frames were fabricated in Taiwan – but now Cotic are going all-in for local manufacturing for this new FlareMAX. That means the steel front triangle &amp; seatstays, plus the short alloy DropLink &amp; alloy chainstay swingarm yoke are all made close to home, then painted, then brought back down to Sheffield to be built up into your dream trail bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_detail-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"Cotic FlareMAX Gen5, 125mm steel full-suspension trail bike, made-in-the-UK, photo by Richard Baybutt, frameset detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_detail-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_detail-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_detail-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_detail-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_detail-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_detail.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are even some actual tweaks to the ovalized and butted Reynolds 853 front end.

Oh, and under the toptube, there’s a new pair of braze-on mounts for a low-profile cage or direct mount tool carrier above the shock, in addition to the 2 bottle cage mounts inside on top of and underneath the downtube.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_riding-detail-NDS.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_riding-detail-NDS-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Cotic FlareMAX Gen5, 125mm steel full-suspension trail bike, made-in-the-UK, photo by Richard Baybutt, riding NDS detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_riding-detail-NDS-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_riding-detail-NDS-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_riding-detail-NDS-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_riding-detail-NDS-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_riding-detail-NDS-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_riding-detail-NDS-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_riding-detail-NDS.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Any gear you can get off your back or out of your hip pack is a win for long days on the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Fit &amp; Geometry, too!</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_trail-riding-drop.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_trail-riding-drop-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Cotic FlareMAX Gen5, 125mm steel full-suspension trail bike, made-in-the-UK, photo by Richard Baybutt, trail riding drop\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_trail-riding-drop-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_trail-riding-drop-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_trail-riding-drop-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_trail-riding-drop-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_trail-riding-drop-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_trail-riding-drop-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Cotic-FlareMAX-Gen5_125mm-steel-trail-bike_made-in-the-UK_photo-by-Richard-Baybutt_trail-riding-drop.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cotic’s long, low &amp; slack Longshot geometry has been pretty progressive since 2018 (designed for 35mm stems), so it doesn’t get a major overhaul, just some subtle tweaks. Think, a 4mm lower BB height for an “even more planted feel through the corners”, but the same 65.6° head angle, ~75.5° seat angle &amp; 448mm chainstays.

And instead, it’s about giving you more choice to pick the feel you want. C-Sizing means more closely spread frame Reach steps, with less Stack variation as well. Plus, shorter seattubes mean smaller riders can fit on more of the frames, and bigger riders can opt for longer travel droppers.
