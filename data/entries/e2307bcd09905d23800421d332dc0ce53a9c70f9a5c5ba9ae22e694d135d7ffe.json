The two Mikes Bikes riders donated the Cannondale bikes to Lunsar Cycling Team after the race.\n\nThe Mike Bike’s Foundation helps to facilitate bike donations from the US to Sierra Leone. They work with partner bike shops in Sierra Leone who pay for the shipping of the bikes. Mikes Bikes runs a strict policy for donations. The criteria the bikes need to meet before they are shipped involves having a market value of over $50. \n\nThe partners in Sierra Leone sell the bikes and/or use the parts on the bikes and make profits from the sales that pay wages, help to run racing teams and fund new cycling related projects.\n\nThere are other organisations running similar schemes. Working Bikes in Chicago, Village Bicycle Project in. Salt Lake City, Mikes Bikes in California and Re-Cycle in the UK.\" title=\"MG_BIke Radar_TDL_212\" />                                            <p>The Tour de Lunsar is Sierra Leone’s biggest bike race, set up by bike shop owner Abdul Karim Kamara as a way to give Sierra Leonians the opportunity to race.</p>\n<p>The first edition of the race took place in 2013, when 10 riders took to the start line on bikes donated by the US and shipped to West Africa by the Village Bike Project, an NGO that aims to empower communities through strengthening bike culture.</p>\n<p>Ten years later, the Tour de Lunsar has grown in size and reputation, attracting cyclists who want to make it professionally.</p>\n<p>The 2023 edition of the event started on the 26 April, Sierra Leone’s independence day, with men’s, women’s and junior races, all of which take place on non-closed roads, competing with traffic and causing lengthy tailbacks.</p>\n<p>The men’s race is split across four stages. The first starts in Freetown, the country’s capital, and each stage ends in Lunsar.</p>\n<p>The women’s race and junior races are single stages culminating in laps of a circuit in Lunsar.</p>\n<p>There were 141 competitors in total. 51 riders took part in the men’s race, 19 in the women’s and 70 in the junior competition.</p>\n<p>Unlike European races, there are no team buses, just cars that have bikes strapped to them in piles. Nigeria’s Team Access Bank by Pitstop had a masseuse table for its riders – something that is <em>de rigueur</em> at professional races such as the Tour de France, but exceptional at the Tour de Lunsar.</p>\n<p>Temperatures rose to 38 degrees and riders sought out shade before setting off.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Blessing Jabbie, of Kono Cycling Team, who finished second in the women’s race, approaches the finish line in Lunsar.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson </i></span></div>\n<p>Cycling may still be a fringe activity in Sierra Leone, but the Tour de Lunsar is helping the sport grow in stature. The 2022 edition was attended by the government minister, Apha Kanu, and it is now in partnership with Science in Sport and has sponsors including Le Col.</p>\n<p>The racing in Sierra Leone is a lot more makeshift than in Rwanda, which is set to host the 2025 UCI road world championships and has been a trailblazer for cycling in Africa.</p>\n<p>However, the Tour de Lunsar demonstrates an appetite and passion for cycling and bike racing in a way that’s unlike any other competition.</p>\n<p>In the words of our photographer Matt Grayson, it is “a story of sporting persistence against adversity” and arguably one of the seedlings of a cycling revolution described in Marlon Moncrieffe’s book <em><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/desire-discrimination-determination-marlon-lee-moncrieffe-book/\">Desire Discrimination Determination</a></em>.</p>\n<p>The majority of riders still take part on donated or second-hand bikes, but with an increasing number of riders in Sierre Leone competing and racing at a higher level, the number of high-end bikes at the race is growing, too.</p>\n<p>Here we take a look at 10 of the bikes raced at the Tour de Lunsar.</p>\n<h2>Kerfala Kamara’s Cannondale CAAD8</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title
