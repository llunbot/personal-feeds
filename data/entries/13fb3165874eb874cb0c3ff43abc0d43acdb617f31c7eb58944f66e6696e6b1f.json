That’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23345120/rocketland-spacex-elon-musk-rocket-ranch-boca-chica-texas\">what people liked all this \ntime</a>: dreaming big, thinking about new possible worlds. It’s \nalso why Musk’s shifting political stance undercuts him. The \nfantasy of the conservative movement is small and sad, a limited \nworld with nothing new to explore. Musk has gone from dreaming \nvery, very big to <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/10/elon-musks-incredible-shrinking-future.html\">seeming very, very small</a>. In the hands of \na talented biographer, this kind of tragic story would provide \nrich material. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2012/02/walter_isaacson_steve_jobs\">My 2012 take on Isaacson’s <em>Steve Jobs</em></a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/04/lopatto-isaacson-musk\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"13fb3165874eb874cb0c3ff43abc0d43acdb617f31c7eb58944f66e6696e6b1f","category":"Tech"}
