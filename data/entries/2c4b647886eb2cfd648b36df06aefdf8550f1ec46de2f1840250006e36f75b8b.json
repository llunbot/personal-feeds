And not some 2D version, either, but the real, blue-and-orange-oval, see-yourself-sideways <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/10/unwrapping-the-orange-box/3/\"><em>Portal</em> experience</a>. And now he has a \"First Slice\" of <a href=\"https://github.com/lambertjamesd/portal64/tree/61d225e9a438b917cfbd4cb544a2f0e62cdad2ca\"><em>Portal 64</em></a> ready for anyone who wants to try it. It's out of beta, and it's free.</p>\n<p>A \"First Slice\" means that 13 of the original game's test chambers are finished. Lambert intends to get to all of the original's 19 chambers. PC Gamer, where we <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/portal-64-now-has-a-playable-first-slice-with-two-thirds-of-the-games-test-chambers/\">first saw this project</a>, suggests that Lambert might also try to get the additional 14 levels in the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/10/portal-still-alive-for-the-xbla-is-familiar-to-pc-gamers/\">Xbox Live-only</a> <em>Portal: Still</em> <em>Alive</em>.</p>\n<p>So why is Lambert doing this—and for free? Lambert enlists an AI-trained version of Cave Johnson's voice to answer that question at the start of his announcement video. \"This is Aperture Science,\" it says, \"where we don't ask why. We ask: why the heck not?\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993742#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993742&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2c4b647886eb2cfd648b36df06aefdf8550f1ec46de2f1840250006e36f75b8b","category":"Tech"}
