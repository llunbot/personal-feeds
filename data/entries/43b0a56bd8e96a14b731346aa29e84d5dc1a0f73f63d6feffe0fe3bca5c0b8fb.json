Remember the whole thing a few weeks back, where AltStore PAL — an EU alternative app marketplace for iOS — started published Hot Tub, a hardcore porno app, and billed it as “approved” by Apple because that’s the word Apple used for apps that were merely notarized for distribution? <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/hot_tob_hardcore_porno_app_eu\">I wrote then</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If we want to get nitty-gritty over verbs, I’d argue that Apple\n<em>accepts</em> apps — like Hot Tub — for notarization, not\n<em>approves</em>. Begrudging <em>acceptance</em> is more of a thing than\nbegrudging <em>approval</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>AltStore’s Riley Testut today <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@rileytestut/114043540322770608\">noted</a> a change in Apple’s notarization confirmation emails.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>February 11: “The following app has been approved for distribution”</li>\n<li>February 19: “The following app is ready for distribution”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I only wish I’d thought of <em>ready</em> as an even more neutral-in-terms-of-conveying-approval word than <em>accepted</em>. I’d have bet my house that Apple would change this language in some way. <em>Ready</em> is perfect here — in no way a euphemism, but in no way conveying approval.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/21/ready-is-the-new-approved\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"43b0a56bd8e96a14b731346aa29e84d5dc1a0f73f63d6feffe0fe3bca5c0b8fb","category":"Tech"}
