Given that it recently got a PC release, this is a great time to catch up on it—but now there's even more reason to do so, as Sony just announced a sequel titled <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>.</p>\n<p>Slated for a 2025 release, the game bears similarities to its predecessor. It follows a wandering samurai who rides horses across picturesque, wind-swept fields, befriends animals, and defeats enemies in katana duels.</p>\n<p>Whereas <em>Ghost of Tsushima </em>was set on Tsushima Island during the time of the Mongol invasion, <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is (fittingly) set around the foot of Mount Yōtei, one of Japan's most picturesque locales—the area is called Hokkaido today.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052227#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052227&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ac6fef4370d557bfcd4e3ef87081da8f17ae04f9f74952d2c6b70143081ef8bd","category":"Tech"}
