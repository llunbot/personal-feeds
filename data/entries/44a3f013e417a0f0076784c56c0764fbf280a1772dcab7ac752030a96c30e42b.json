{"title":"Chance Miller Reviews the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/11/powerbeats-pro-2-review/","date":1742241600000,"content":"\n<p>I’m a month late linking to it, but Chance Miller wrote a terrific review for 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The last several releases from Beats, such as <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/05/17/beats-studio-buds-plus-review/\">the Studio Buds\nPlus</a> and <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-4-hands-on-the-most-iconic-beats-headphones-just-got-better/\">Solo 4 headphones</a>, have been powered by a\ncustom Beats chip rather than an Apple-designed chip like what’s\nused in AirPods. For Beats, this has enabled better cross-platform\nsupport for Android users, but it’s also come at the cost of\nseveral popular features for Apple fans. For example, the Studio\nBuds Plus lack support for automatic in-ear detection, iCloud\npairing, automatic device switching, personalized spatial audio,\nand more.</p>\n\n<p>With the Powerbeats Pro 2, Beats has gone back to its roots and\nopted for an Apple-designed chip. The Powerbeats Pro 2 are powered\nby Apple’s H2 chip, the same chip used by the latest-generation\nAirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4. This means you get the full suite of\nApple-focused audio features.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The degree of shared engineering between Apple’s teams and Beats’s has always seemed odd to me. Sometimes it seems like Beats really is an independent subsidiary, focused on cross-platform headphones, and others times it feels like they’re making Apple products under a different brand label. The sweet spot seems to be about where they landed with these Powerbeats 2.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All of the aforementioned features and improvements make\nPowerbeats Pro 2 an incredibly compelling product, but Beats has\none more thing: Powerbeats Pro 2 feature built-in heart rate\nmonitoring.</p>\n\n<p>Each Powerbeats Pro 2 earbud has a built-in heart rate monitor\ncomprised of four components. First, there’s an LED sensor that\nemits green LED light at a rate of over 100 pulses per second.\nThis light is emitted through the skin and hits your red blood\ncells. The photodiode then receives the reflected light from the\nred blood cells that is modulated by the red blood flow. There’s\nan optical lens that helps direct and separate the transmitted and\nreceived light, along with an accelerometer to ensure accuracy and\nconsistency in data collection.</p>\n\n<p>Beats adds that the Powerbeats Pro 2’s heart rate sensor\ntechnology is derived from Apple’s work on the Apple Watch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s weird, but cool, that Beats has delivered in-ear heartbeat monitoring before Apple’s own AirPods have. But now it seems like a lock that this will be a feature in AirPods Pro 3, right?</p>\n\n<p>What I always want in a review I read — and what I try to provide to readers through my own reviews — is a sense of whether a product is for me. Powerbeats Pro 2 aren’t for me — and I know it, because Miller’s review describes them so well. But they seem like a terrific product that a <em>lot</em> of people would prefer to AirPods Pro.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/17/chance-miller-reviews-the-beats-powerbeats-pro-2\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"44a3f013e417a0f0076784c56c0764fbf280a1772dcab7ac752030a96c30e42b","category":"Tech"}
