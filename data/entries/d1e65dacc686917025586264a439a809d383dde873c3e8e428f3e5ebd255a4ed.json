Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>Over the last couple of weeks, we've brought you test drives of a pair of related small cars, the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/02/smallish-car-biggish-price-we-try-out-the-2024-bmw-x2-m35i/\">2024 BMW X2 M35i</a> and the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/02/cool-cabin-plenty-of-infotainment-lag-the-2025-mini-jcw-countryman/\">2025 Mini JCW Countryman</a>. Today it's time for the third member of the family destined for US sales, and the one that we think Ars readers will be most interested in—the fully electric Mini Countryman SE ALL4.</p>\n<p>This is the third-generation Mini Countryman, replacing the plug-in hybrid version <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/10/minis-new-countryman-hybrid-is-hobbled-by-too-small-a-battery/\">we last tested in 2017</a>. It's a little larger now, although not by much: at 174.5 inches (4,433 mm) long, 72.6 inches (1,843 mm) wide, and 65.2 inches (1,656 mm) tall, it is still a pretty small car by most standards. It's also a pretty aero-efficient one; the drag coefficient is just 0.26.</p>\n<p>As the ALL4 name might suggest, this is an all-wheel drive electric vehicle, with a combined 313 hp (230 kW) and 365 lb-ft (494 Nm), fed by a 66.5 kWh lithium-ion traction battery. That makes it nearly as peppy off the line as a Ferrari Testarossa, capable of reaching 62 mph (100 km/h) from a standing start in 5.6 seconds. (The Ferrari took 5.2 seconds to reach 60 mph.) Top speed is limited to 112 mph (180 km/h).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2008091#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2008091&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
