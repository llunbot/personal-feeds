It’s one of those products that sits in Apple’s lineup and it’s not really talked about until a rumor pops up–and we finally have a juicy rumor, complete with pictures!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kotsutami, who describes themselves as one who “collect [sic] everything Apple” and has posted prototypes in the past, posted on X what they say is a prototype of the next HomePod. It has “different glass” for the display at the top, which could mean Apple will implement a touchscreen.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>An Engineering build HomePod frameshell with a completely different glass on top- it’s set for touchscreen, with black bezel<br />The design of shell is similar to HomePod 2nd gen's, not the 1st gen—it stands ï£¿ might decided add ðŸ–¥ï¸ for 2's but not at last, OR it’s next generation <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/W5zRIVGPiK&amp;xcust=1-1-2113851-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/W5zRIVGPiK</a></p>— Kosutami (@KosutamiSan) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/KosutamiSan/status/1715670862773514358?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2113851-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">October 21, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/21/new-homepod-lcd-display/&amp;xcust=1-1-2113851-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">9to5Mac</a> says they have sources that verify Kotsutami’s pictures as legitimate, and they provide a few more details. They report that the codename of the HomePod is B720, and that Apple is using a version of tvOS with rewritten Apple Music and Podcasts apps that are suited to the display of the prototype HomePod. The display could show colors based on the album art while audio is playing, and notifications can appear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple continues developing this HomePod, it will be the first major development since its release earlier this year. But it’s not the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePod with a screen</a> that a lot of users are hoping for.
