The testing is particularly nerve-racking given that it closely follows the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/02/we-may-now-know-whos-behind-the-lead-tainted-cinnamon-in-toddler-fruit-pouches/\">tragic poisoning</a> of <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/lead-prevention/news/outbreak-applesauce-pouches.html\">at least 519 US children</a>, who were exposed to extremely high levels of lead from purposefully tainted cinnamon in applesauce snack pouches.</p>\n<p>With that horrifying event in mind, parents are likely primed to be alarmed by any other lead findings in cinnamon. So, how concerning were the concentrations Consumer Reports found? And does one need to strictly adhere to the limits the organization recommends? By my calculations, not very and probably not. It's really not an alarming report.</p>\n<p>Similar to the outlet's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/11/despite-spooky-consumer-reports-testing-metals-in-chocolates-arent-scary/\">chocolate testing</a> before it, the lead concentrations found in cinnamons were largely within standard ranges. In all, the report is more of a reminder that trace amounts of heavy metals are present in various common foods. And such watchdog testing can play a crucial role in keeping consumers safe, especially with underfunded and underpowered regulators.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049761#p3\">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049761&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"af2c47856d8a0bfb9cc1f44d813bb4331d2c14f5802578e25f20b7554620c725","category":"Tech"}
