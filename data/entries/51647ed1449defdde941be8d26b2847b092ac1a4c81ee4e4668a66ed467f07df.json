And the end game is nothing short of revolutionary: an entirely new way to forecast weather based on artificial intelligence that can run on a desktop computer.</p>\n<p>Today's artificial intelligence systems require one resource more than any other to operateâ€”data. For example, large language models such as ChatGPT voraciously consume data to improve answers to queries. The more and higher quality data, the better their training, and the sharper the results.</p>\n<p>However, there is a finite limit to quality data, even on the Internet. These large language models have hoovered up so much data that they're <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/why-the-new-york-times-might-win-its-copyright-lawsuit-against-openai/\">being sued widely for copyright infringement</a>. And as they're running out of data, the operators of these AI models are turning to ideas such as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/the-ai-wars-heat-up-with-claude-3-claimed-to-have-near-human-abilities/\">synthetic data</a> to keep feeding the beast and produce ever more capable results for users.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027736#p3\">Read 41 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027736&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"51647ed1449defdde941be8d26b2847b092ac1a4c81ee4e4668a66ed467f07df","category":"Tech"}
