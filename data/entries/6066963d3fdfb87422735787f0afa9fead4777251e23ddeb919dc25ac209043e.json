He was 82.</p>\n\n<p>The cause was pancreatic cancer, Adobe, which Dr. Warnock started\nin 1982 with Chuck Geschke, said in a statement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It was just a month ago that pancreatic cancer took Kevin Mitnick, and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/20/kevin-mitnick-rip\">I remarked</a> on how many people this specific cancer has taken of late.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Until Dr. Warnock and Adobe came along, desktop printing was an\narduous, expensive and unsatisfying endeavor. Users relied on\neither a screechy dot-matrix printer, with its pixelated text, or\na specialized typesetting machine, which could cost $10,000 and\ntake up most of a room.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Warnock developed protocols that came loaded into desktop\nprinters themselves, and that accurately rendered what a computer\nsent them. Adobe’s first such protocol, PostScript, went into\nApple’s revolutionary LaserWriter, released in 1985, and within a\nfew years it was the industry standard.</p>\n\n<p>PostScript, licensed to hundreds of software and hardware\ncompanies, helped make Adobe rich. But the company was largely\nunknown to the public until 1993, when it released Acrobat, a\nprogram designed to render and read files in what it called a\nPortable Document Format, or PDF.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>PDF was an enormous breakthrough, and is more relevant today than ever. A true document format for the ages. But Adobe was well on its way before 1993. <a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2015/02/20/a-blast-from-the-past-demos-of-adobe-photoshop-1-0/\">Photoshop 1.0 launched in early 1990</a>. They began shipping their library of original <a href=\"https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=5141\">PostScript fonts and the essential Adobe Type Manager software</a> in 1989. And Illustrator 1.0 launched back in 1987, shipping with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjPTMfVBDh0\">this video tour demonstrated by Warnock himself</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Warnock and Geschke understood what Steve Jobs often preached: technology alone was not enough. PostScript was — <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/postscript.html\">and remains</a>! — excellent technology. But it was not a product. The LaserWriter was a product. You hooked it up, went to File → Print in <em>any</em> application, and you got professional-grade 300 DPI output with no technical expertise necessary. It was as easy to print high-quality output on a LaserWriter as it was to print junk output on a slow, noisy dot-matrix printer. <em>That</em> was a product.</p>\n\n<p>And Illustrator turned PostScript from a rather difficult but highly-capable programming language into a tool designed for use by artists. They didn’t just make a nice code editor for writing PostScript. They created an app that presented a visual framework in which you directly manipulated shapes, lines, and curves as objects. Even expert Illustrator users were never exposed to PostScript directly. The Illustrator metaphor was a complete <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/file-types/image/vector/eps-file.html\">encapsulation</a>. That too was a product, and Illustrator remains an essential tool. If Warnock and Geschke had been satisfied merely with shipping great technology alone, Adobe Systems would be a nearly forgotten Silicon Valley footnote. Instead, they pushed to make Adobe the great tool-making product company we know today.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/26/john-warnock-rip\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6066963d3fdfb87422735787f0afa9fead4777251e23ddeb919dc25ac209043e","category":"Tech"}
