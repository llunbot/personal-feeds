Even several days later, it remains difficult to process the significance of what SpaceX achieved in South Texas last Sunday. The moment of seeing a rocket fall out of the sky and be captured by two arms felt historic to me, as historic as the company's first drone ship landing in April 2016. What a time to be alive.</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site).

Rocket Lab adds a last-minute mission</strong>. After signing a launch contract less than two months ago, <a href=\"https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-adds-new-mission-to-2024-launch-manifest-schedules-launch-in-coming-days/\">Rocket Lab says</a> it will launch a customer as early as Saturday from New Zealand on board its Electron launch vehicle. Rocket Lab added that the customer for the expedited mission, to be named \"Changes In Latitudes, Changes In Attitudes,\" is confidential. This is an impressive turnaround in launch times and will allow Rocket Lab to burnish its credentials for the US Space Force, which has prioritized \"responsive\" launch in recent years.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/rocket-report-bloomberg-calls-for-sls-cancellation-spacex-hits-century-mark/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/rocket-report-bloomberg-calls-for-sls-cancellation-spacex-hits-century-mark/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"37b298314df9a8e8af0fa489adc1d3ac4b50bd66b80a70c767fe8af96671e440","category":"Tech"}
