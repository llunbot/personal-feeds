Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>LEIPZIG, Germanyâ€”The Porsche Macan has carved out a rather solid reputation for itself over the years, bringing hot hatch-like driving fun to the premium midsize crossover segment. Next year there's an all-new Macan, an entirely electric one that makes use of a new EV platform shared with corporate sibling Audi. Earlier this summer <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/porsches-macan-ev-comes-out-in-2024-we-drive-the-prototype/\">we spent a few hours driving prototype Macan EVs around Los Angeles</a>, but at the time Porsche was being tight-lipped in terms of technical details. Now, on a visit to the factory in Germany where the cars will be made, we've learned a little more.</p>\n<h2>PPE</h2>\n<p>The new Macan is one of the first EVs to utilize Premium Platform Electric, which Porsche is developing <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/10/audi-is-planning-20-all-electric-models-by-2025-heres-how-it-will-do-it/\">together with Audi</a>. Other PPE-based EVs due in the near future include the Audi Q6 e-tron SUV, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/04/this-electric-fastback-is-the-next-audi-a6-e-tron-due-in-late-2022/\">A6 e-tron sedan</a>, and maybe <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/03/slinky-stylish-audi-a6-avant-e-tron-previews-future-ev-station-wagon/\">even a station wagon</a>, and if you click some of those links you'll find deadlines that have come and gone sometime in the past.</p>\n<p>That's because development of PPE hasn't gone quite as smoothly as everyone at Volkswagen Group would have hoped. A significant factor in that has been software-related trouble at CARIAD, VW Group's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/whats-going-on-with-volkswagens-software-division/\">new software division</a>. But the first PPE cars <em>are</em> headed to market soon, and in the case of the Macan, with more than 1.8 million miles (3 million km) of testing under its tires.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990059#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990059&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
