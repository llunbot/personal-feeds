The company's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/01/apple-screwing-new-iphones-out-of-simple-diy-repair/\">often</a> <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/apple-locks-new-iphone-batteries-to-prevent-third-party-repair-report-says/\">contentious</a> <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/03/industry-and-apple-opposing-right-to-repair-laws/\">relationship</a> with the repair community was tested again when \"unauthorized\" iPhone 13 screen replacements started resulting in broken Face ID systems. A new report from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772433/apple-iphone-13-screen-replacements-face-id-software-update\">The Verge</a> says that Apple \"will release a software update that doesn't require you to transfer the microcontroller to keep Face ID working after a screen swap.\"</p>\n<p>Screen replacements are the most common smartphone repairs. Apple included a new microcontroller in the iPhone 13's display that pairs each screen with other components in the phone. As iFixit <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/News/54829/apples-new-screen-repair-trap-could-change-the-repair-industry-forever\">reported</a>, if a third-party repair shop replaced the iPhone 13 display, Apple would disable the phone's Face ID system.</p>\n<p>The repair community has started calling this part-dependency trend \"serialization.\" Basically, each protected component reports a serial number to the OS, and the software keeps track of which serial numbers the device is supposed to have. If you swap out a part, one of the serial numbers will change, and the OS will know about it. In the case of third-party iPhone 13 screen replacements, the phone would say, \"Unable to activate Face ID on this iPhone.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811955#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811955&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"458c35abe9da3ca539828409bcdec9aa4ac38127cb227ebeeb09e2ddd48f04cd","category":"Tech"}
