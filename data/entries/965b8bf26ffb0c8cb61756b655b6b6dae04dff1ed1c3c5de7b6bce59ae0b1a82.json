The two patents that have been invalidated were involved in that lawsuit, and now Apple might get the entire judgment vacated.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple appealed the $502.8 million award verdict after it was rendered, with both Apple and VirnetX presenting arguments in the appeal back in September. VirnetX attorney Jeff Lamken said at the time that if the court ultimately sided with the USPTO and invalidated the patents in the patent validity case, VirnetX could \"have a big problem.\" He said that he did not think VirnetX would have an \"enforceable judgment\" in that situation, so this is potentially a major win for Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the patents now invalidated, VirnetX and Apple will again meet in court over the initial appeals case that Apple filed to determine whether Apple will need to pay up, and it's looking like the $502.8 million verdict will be thrown out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRegardless of how this case plays out, Apple was forced to pay VirnetX <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/15/virnetx-wins-440-million-from-apple/\">$440 million</a> for violating VirnetX's communications security patents with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> and iMessage features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVirnetX is largely viewed a patent holding company or \"patent troll\" that does not offer actual products or services. It generates revenue by litigating technology companies that infringe on its patents, though it does also market its \"War Room\" software for authenticated meetings.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent-lawsuits/\">Patent Lawsuits</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/30/apple-virnetx-successful-patent-appeal/\">Apple Wins Appeals Battle in Ongoing Patent Infringement War With VirnetX, Could Save $502.8 Million</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-wins-appeals-battle-in-ongoing-patent-infringement-war-with-virnetx-could-save-502-8-million.2385386/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"965b8bf26ffb0c8cb61756b655b6b6dae04dff1ed1c3c5de7b6bce59ae0b1a82","category":"Apple"}
