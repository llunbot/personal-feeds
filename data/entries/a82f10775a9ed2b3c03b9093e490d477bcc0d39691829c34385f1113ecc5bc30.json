{"title":"Nate Silver: ‘Tim Walz Is a Minnesota Nice Choice’","link":"https://www.natesilver.net/p/tim-walz-is-a-minnesota-nice-choice","date":1722964029000,"content":"\n<p>Nate Silver:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This was a choice designed to maintain the social fabric of the\nDemocratic Party, and avoid news cycles about a disappointed left\nand Democrats’ internal squabbling over the War in Gaza. Or at\nleast, that’s what I think it was: we’ll need to learn more about\nHarris’s deliberation process. I’m not inclined to be too\ndeferential to any political candidate, but it’s plausible that\nthere were vetting issues with the runner-up, Gov. Josh Shapiro of\nPennsylvania. Harris certainly has more information about the\ninternal feeling within the Democratic caucus than I do, or she\nmay just have thought the chemistry of a Harris-Shapiro ticket\nwouldn’t work.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a <em>nice</em> pick: Walz, a two-term governor and six-term U.S.\nRepresentative, is from the family of Tim Kaine-style VP choices:\ninoffensive, unlikely to cause any harm, “safe”. Although maybe\nthat’s unfair: Walz is likely to be better on the stump than\nKaine. If you surveyed Democratic members of Congress, he’d\n<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/nancy-pelosi-reportedly-favorite-v-192956376.html\">probably be who they’d choose</a>. But I believe he’s\n<a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/why-she-should-pick-shapiro\">probably the wrong choice</a>, a step back toward the\nDemocratic Party’s instincts to triangulate instead of the\nboldness the Harris campaign has displayed so far. [...]</p>\n\n<p>On Saturday, I <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/why-she-should-pick-shapiro\">made the case</a> that Harris should pick\nShapiro. And nothing has <em>really</em> changed since then — although\nyou could argue that Harris’s <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/kamalamentum-vs-economic-headwinds\">increasingly strong position in the\npolls</a> compels greater risk-aversion than when she’d\ninitially appeared to be an underdog against Donald Trump. The\nbasic reasons for picking Shapiro are that he <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/could-josh-shapiro-win-kamala-harris\">increases the\nlikelihood you win Pennsylvania</a>, he has a demonstrated\ntrack record of popularity in the most important swing state, he’s\nobviously an extremely talented politician and perhaps a future\nstandard-bearer for the party himself. And also, the reasons for\n<em>not</em> picking Shapiro aren’t great. Democrats in the political\nbubble <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/your-friends-are-not-a-representative\">overstate the salience of the Gaza issue</a> and\nunderstate the benefits of moderation, and that’s before getting\ninto the issue of Shapiro’s Jewishness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My fear is that Walz is, as Silver also worries, another Tim Kaine. Tim Kaine didn’t lose the 2016 election but he didn’t help win it either. Kaine is a fine senator but a total milquetoast. Zero charisma. As soon as the 2016 election was over <a href=\"https://politicalwire.com/?s=kaine\">he completely disappeared from the national stage</a>. It’s been 8 years and I’ve only seen Kaine in the news once in that entire stretch, and that was because <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/snarled-snow-sen-tim-kaine-trapped-nearly-27-hour-nightmare-n1286955\">he got stuck on I-95 for 27 hours because of a snowstorm</a>. Bill Clinton picked a running mate who had the charisma and gravitas to run for and win the presidency on his own. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election_recount_in_Florida\">Gore lost by like 600 votes in Florida</a>, of course, but clearly he could have won.) Barack Obama picked a running mate who went on to run for president and beat Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton picked a running mate with the personality of a wet towel.</p>\n\n<p>I’m thinking Walz is more like Biden in 2008 though. Reassuring in-his-60s white guy with a solid career, thorough knowledge of the issues, and with good zip on his political-barbs fastball.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/06/silver-walz\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a82f10775a9ed2b3c03b9093e490d477bcc0d39691829c34385f1113ecc5bc30","category":"Tech"}
