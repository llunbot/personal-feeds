The Electronic Frontier Foundation called it “<a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/oakland-new-gold-standard-community-control-police-surveillance\">the new gold standard in community control of police surveillance</a>.” Since then, about 20 other cities have adopted similar laws.</p>\n<p>Now, Brian Hofer, one of the architects of Oakland’s law, says it’s not working. Earlier this month, Hofer <a href=\"https://secure-justice.org/blog/why-should-you-care-about-our-lawsuit-against-the-city-of-oakland\">filed suit against</a> the city and the police department, saying the department has repeatedly violated the law.</p>\n<p>“We ignored human nature,” Hofer says in an interview. “Police don't like to be transparent. Surveillance technology use is by design secretive, and no self-interested party is going to voluntarily highlight anything negative about their own proposal.” A spokesperson for the Oakland Police Department says it doesn’t comment on ongoing legal matters.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798346#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798346&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1c7d8333a14b09025e00a60bfcc8ace62f6472c2286c48f3e11c88ccbbdc8a4d","category":"Tech"}
