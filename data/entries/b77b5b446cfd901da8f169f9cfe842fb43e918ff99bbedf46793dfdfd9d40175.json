There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we're going to take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder.</em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Good morning. It's March 26, and today's photo comes from the Hubble Space Telescope. It showcases a very young multi-star system known as FS Tau.</p>\n<p>This star system is only about 2.8 million years old. In terms of cosmic time, that is but a blink of the eye. It lies about 450-light-years away from Earth.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012480#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012480&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b77b5b446cfd901da8f169f9cfe842fb43e918ff99bbedf46793dfdfd9d40175","category":"Tech"}
