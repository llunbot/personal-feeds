{"title":"An AppleScript for Safari: Split Tabs to New Window","link":"https://gist.github.com/gruber/eb89728474ba59287df79c054e1097a5","date":1701824959000,"content":"\n<p>I finally got around to scratching a longstanding itch. I’m an inveterate web browser tab hoarder, and a scenario I frequently encounter is wanting to move the most recent (typically, rightmost) tabs into a new window all by themselves. Let’s say, for example, I have 26 tabs open in the frontmost Safari window, A through Z. The current selected tab is X. This script will move tabs X, Y, and Z to a new window, leaving tabs A through W open in the old window. It starts with the current tab, and moves that tab and those to the right.</p>\n\n<p>I have the script saved saved in my <a href=\"https://redsweater.com/fastscripts/\">FastScripts</a> scripts folder for Safari, but I tend to invoke it from LaunchBar (which I have configured to index my entire scripts folder hierarchy). Command-Space to bring up LaunchBar, type “spl” to select this script, hit Return, done.</p>\n\n<p>I have no idea how many others might want this, but in recent years here at DF I’ve gotten away from sharing my occasional scripting hacks, and feel like I ought to get back to sharing them. Can’t let Dr. Drang have all the fun.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Leon Crowle adapted my script to be more elegant and concise. If you’re using this but grabbed the script before 10:30pm ET, go back and re-grab it.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/05/an-applescript-for-safari-split-tabs-to-new-window\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3c0a13684b28589f69c274af478e757ccf60ef70027069ef2eed77c345d12c87","category":"Tech"}
