Phone Freedom includes multiple facets, such as a new upgrade plan and options to help customers get out of their smartphone contracts when switching.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/04/tmobilelogo.jpg\" alt width=\"1280\" height=\"573\" />\r<br />\nGo5G Plus is T-Mobile's new wireless plan that includes an upgraded device every two years. T-Mobile says that it ensures new and existing customers will get the \"same great device deals\" along with $270 \"in added value every month\" for families that have multiple lines.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Go5G Plus plan includes 50GB of hotspot data per month and 15GB of data in Mexico and Canada each month. Right now, T-Mobile is offering a promotion that includes a free 5G phone with an eligible trade-in, along with a free third line.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/tmobile-price-comparison-chart.jpg\" alt width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" />\r<br />\nThere are caveats, though. Go5G Plus is T-Mobile's most expensive plan at $90 per month for a single line with AutoPay enabled. Prices get cheaper with more lines, with two and three lines both priced at $150/month and a fourth line available for $185/month total for all four lines. It is on par with Magenta MAX at the three line level, but more expensive for four lines. T-Mobile's Magenta and Essentials plans are cheaper, as is the \"Go5G, a plan that does not offer unlimited high-speed data.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor customers who want to swap to T-Mobile but who are locked into AT&amp;T with a three-year device contract, T-Mobile says that it will pay off the old phone and give customers a new phone on the T-Mobile network through the \"Easy Unlock\" option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is also a \"Go Back Guarantee\" for switchers who try T-Mobile and then decide they want to return to their prior carrier.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nT-Mobile says that it is making these changes because \"millions of people\" are locked into three-year device financing contracts with carriers like AT&amp;T and Verizon, which means many people can only upgrade their phones every three years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Phone Freedom options <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/resources/how-to-join-us\">will be available</a> starting on Sunday, April 23.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/t-mobile/\">T-Mobile</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/20/t-mobile-go5g-plus-upgrade-plan/\">T-Mobile Launches 'Go5G Plus' Two-Year Upgrade Plan, Will Help Would-Be Customers Get Out of Device Contracts</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/t-mobile-launches-go5g-plus-two-year-upgrade-plan-will-help-would-be-customers-get-out-of-device-contracts.2387342/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6dca26b94ba6a8cea89a2e0495068821a0ae31c53320a4e44782569c89c56818","category":"Apple"}
