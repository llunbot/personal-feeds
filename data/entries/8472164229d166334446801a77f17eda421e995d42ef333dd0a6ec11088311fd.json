There are men’s, women’s, standard and tall versions. Sizes run from 2XS right through to 2XL.</p>\n<p>It weighs a claimed 300g in an unspecified size.</p>\n<h2>Aero meets gravel</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The green colour option is one of few nods to gravel tradition.</span></figcaption><span> <i>NoPinz</i></span></div>\n<p>Elite <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/gravel-racing/\">gravel racing</a> is fast but not quite <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/10-steps-to-your-best-ever-time-trial/\">time-trial </a>speed. Therefore, the aero clothing brand says it has designed the tightly fitting sleeves of the Pro-1 to be most aerodynamic at lower speeds.</p>\n<p>Other areas, such as the breathable mesh torso, prioritise ventilation to keep the rider cool, according to Nopinz. This could be valuable in long, hot races such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/horse-for-the-course-niner-rlt-9-rdo-unbound-100/\">Unbound Gravel</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The aero design has evolved to include storage and crash protection.</span></figcaption><span> <i>NoPinz</i></span></div>\n<p>Nopinz claims reinforced Dyneema panels on the hip area provide protection in the event of crashes. Meanwhile, the chamois is said to be “gravel-specific”.</p>\n<p>A mesh cargo pocket on the outside of each leg and three large rear pockets enable you to carry and access snacks, such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-energy-bars/\">energy bars</a>, on the go, according to the brand.</p>\n<h2>Why has Nopinz released a gravel skinsuit?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> No safety pins or numbers flapping in the wind.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The British brand made its name by developing the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/first-look-friday/poc-tempor-helmet/\">SpeedPocket</a> – a clear pouch for holding race numbers at the back of a skinsuit without the need for safety pins.</p>\n<p>The SpeedPocket can save a rider eight to nine watts at 50km/h, according to Nopinz. Its skinsuits are now a fixture at mid-week 10-mile time trials and World Championships alike.</p>\n<p>Explaining the decision to diversify into gravel, Nopinz founder and CEO Blake Pond said: “It’s clear that the market is calling out for a performance-orientated, gravel-specific skinsuit, at an affordable price point.”</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Despite costing £200, the Pro-1 isn’t the priciest skinsuit around.</span></figcaption><span> <i>NoPinz</i></span></div>\n<p>To some, close-fitting aero clothing might not be in the spirit of gravel. However, the increasing popularity, speed and professionalisation of the discipline have made aerodynamics more influential.</p>\n<p>After <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/unbound-aero-bars/\">Unbound Gravel banned aero bars for the elite</a>, riders may look elsewhere to reduce drag.
