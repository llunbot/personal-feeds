While two of the cases in people were mild, the other two required hospitalization, including the fatal case. The five dogs were reported to have mild to moderate cases.</p>\n<p>The outbreak was caused by the poorly understood fungus <em>Blastomyces</em> (<em>B. dermatitidis</em> and <em>B. gilchristii</em>), which lurks in moist soil and decomposing organic matter, such as wood and leaves, often near water. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the fungus could <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/pdf/more-information-about-fungal-maps-508.pdf\">exist throughout the eastern US</a>, but its distribution is uneven. It's often found around the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and the Great Lakes. Parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota are considered hotspots.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928471#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928471&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1481dd6b073cac3ebc60dd7e9e55486af31a0aa306a9edbd83dd8dc39220b574","category":"Tech"}
