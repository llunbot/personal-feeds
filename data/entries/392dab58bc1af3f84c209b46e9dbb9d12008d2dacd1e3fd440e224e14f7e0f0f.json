Among the more contentious features is AI-powered summaries of notifications on the lock screen and notification shade. It’s useful when you have a bunch of notifications from the same app or to quickly give you an idea of what updates to a Messages thread are all about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like everything powered by Artificial Intelligence, it can get things wrong. Sometimes, <em>very</em> wrong. When summarizing news alerts, these poor summaries can completely misrepresent the real story, and Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2569963/apple-promises-to-improve-ai-news-summaries-following-embarrassing-inaccuracies.html\">rightly received some real criticism</a> over it. What’s more, the tiny little icon in the notification is not a clear enough indication that you’re looking at an AI-generated summary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2558637/ios-18-3-release-date-beta-features-and-compatibility.html\">iOS 18.3</a> (starting in beta 3), Apple is introducing several key changes to Apple Intelligence notification summaries that should help address these issues:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Notification Summaries for apps in the News &amp; Entertainment category will be disabled for now, and re-enabled in a future update when Apple improves the accuracy of the AI summaries.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When you enable Notification Summaries in settings, it more clearly states that the feature is a beta (as all Apple Intelligence features are) and that summaries “may contain errors.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Summarized text is italicized, in addition to the little AI summary icon next to the text. This will further separate them from regular notification text.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can disable Notification Summaries for an app right from the lock screen. Swipe left on the notification partway, choose “Options” then “Turn off Summaries.”</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>These changes are active starting in iOS 18.3 beta 3 and should be present when iOS 18.3 is released widely, likely in late January or early February.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"392dab58bc1af3f84c209b46e9dbb9d12008d2dacd1e3fd440e224e14f7e0f0f","category":"Apple"}
