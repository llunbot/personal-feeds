The cuts will come to about 16 percent annually, several Russian publications, <a href=\"https://www.finanz.ru/novosti/aktsii/rossiya-rezko-sokrashchat-raskhody-na-kosmos-posle-kritiki-putina-1030840968\">including Finanz.ru</a>, report. (These Russian-language articles were translated for Ars by Rob Mitchell.)</p>\n<p>For 2022, the state budget for space activities will be set at 210 billion rubles ($2.9 billion), a cut of 40.3 billion rubles ($557 million) from the previous year. Similar cuts will follow in subsequent years. The most significant decreases will be in areas such as “manufacturing-technological activities\" and \"cosmodrome development.\" Funding for \"scientific research and development\" was zeroed out entirely.</p>\n\n<p>The publications say Russian President Vladimir Putin is unhappy with the performance of Russia's space program. At a space industry meeting on September 29, they report, Putin criticized the industry’s failure to fulfill directives on long-term goals in the space sphere. In 2020, for example, Roscosmos failed to hit 30 of the 83 stated goals of the national space program.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802383#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802383&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0806e14d1dd3acada11ccd56817be14706eec43ddd9dc2071e12d243d8ff4bc6","category":"Tech"}
