The modular design and accompanying accessories allow the Action 2 to be used for a range of activities, from biking to surfing to vlogging.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to DJI, the Action 2 is dustproof, waterproof, and drop-proof, so it is ideal for adventuring and extreme sports. There's a 1/1.7-inch sensor that can record 4K video at up to 120 frames per second, and it has a 155 degree super wide field of view for capturing more of a scene.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere's a Color Temperature Sensor that's designed to maintain color tones in complex lighting conditions and underwater recording, plus the camera includes DJI's Electronic Image Stabilization technology to keep footage smooth.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/dji-action-cam-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nOther video features include Slow Motion, Hyperlapse and Timelapse, QuickClip for capturing short videos, and livestreaming support. The Action 2 can also be used as a USB video device class for a computer for live gaming broadcasts and conference calls.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe DJI Action 2 has a 1.76-inch OLED touchscreen, and an additional OLED screen can be added on with a front touchscreen module that attaches to the bottom of the camera unit. With this setup, the Action 2 turns into an ideal selfie and vlogging camera option.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOn its own, the DJI Action 2 lasts for up to 70 minutes, but there are also several add-on options to increase battery life. The Front Touchscreen Module boosts battery life to 160 minutes, and the Power Module allows for 180 minutes of usage before a recharge is needed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDJI has designed a whole range of accessories for the Action Cam 2. In addition to the aforementioned Front Touchscreen Module and Power Module, there's a Magnetic Lanyard for wearing the camera, a Magnetic Ball-Joint Adapter Mount, a Magnetic Adapter Mount, a Remote Control Extension Rod, a Floating Handle for use in the water, a Waterproof Case, a Magnetic Headband for head-mounted video, a micrphone with a recording range of 200 meters, and a Macro Lens for close-up shots.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/dji-action-cam-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.dji.com/404?from=/dji-action-2\">DJI Action 2 Dual-Screen Combo</a> will be available for purchase starting on November 2 <a href=\"https://www.dji.com\">from the DJI website</a>, with other accessories set to come out in mid-November.
