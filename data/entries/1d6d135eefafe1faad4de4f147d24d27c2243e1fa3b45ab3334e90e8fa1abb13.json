This weekend, Milan-San Remo marked the first Monument of the year for the men’s peloton, and boy, was it entertaining. Contenders had been whittled down on a record-breaking ascent of the Poggio, leaving the four heavyweights of Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers), Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates) and Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) to battle for honours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sixty-two years after his grandfather Raymond Poulidor won the 1961 Milan-San Remo, Van der Poel shot off like a rocket. A carrot dangling on a string, the chasing trio could occasionally see the distant figure of the flying Dutchman, but could never reel him back in. Van der Poel’s solo attack went the distance for his third Monument win, with Ganna second and Van Aert third.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>U23 Cyclocross World Champion Shirin van Anrooij (Trek-Segafredo), meanwhile, is proving a delight to watch on the road. Her first WorldTour win also arrived in the shape of a solo breakaway at Trofeo Alfredo Binda on Sunday as teammate Elisa Balsamo won the sprint for second and celebrated with great joy after the team’s 1-2 finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Bianchi issues statement after GP Denain</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"595\" height=\"456\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/hofstetter-bianchi-handlebars-gp-denain.png\" alt=\"bianchi oltre bike handlebar snapped from hoods during race\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/hofstetter-bianchi-handlebars-gp-denain.png 595w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/hofstetter-bianchi-handlebars-gp-denain-300x230.png 300w\" /><figcaption>Oopsies</figcaption><figcaption>Eurosport/GCN+</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Sebastián Molano (UAE Team Emirates) sprinted to victory at the Grand Prix de Denain last Thursday, but one of the main talking points centred on Arkéa-Samsic’s Hugo Hofstetter. Notably, how he broke two sets of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/worldtour-team-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">Bianchi Oltre RC</a> handlebars within 25km of racing. After the initial crash split his carbon bars by the hoods, the Frenchman replaced his bike before crashing a second time with the same result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand has since released a statement saying: ‘Based on what we’ve learned, Bianchi would like to clarify the following. As already communicated by Arkéa-Samsic, the breaks suffered by the handlebar of the Bianchi Oltre RC were caused by two different falls… during two separate segments of the race. In both cases, the incident caused a severe impact on the component.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Like all Bianchi products, Oltre RC handlebars have successfully passed validation test protocols in accordance with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 4210-5 regulations and are safe to use by both our customers and professional athletes equipped with Bianchi. The possible breakage of a carbon fibre handlebar is a predictable condition as a consequence of a strong impact generated by uncontrollable dynamics.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hate uncontrollable dynamics.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2023-pro-cycling-tour-de-france-nice\">Pro Log: Final stages of 2024 Tour de France, Women’s Tour funding crisis, Tom Boonen retracts Colnago criticism</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/in-pictures-bianchis-classic-bikes\">A history of Bianchi’s classic bikes</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\">Cycling spring Classics 2023: Race dates, Monuments, cobbles and live TV guide</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>2.

You’d be right of course, but in this instance, it’s a little bit different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/where-paris-roubaix-2022-will-be-decided-part-1-the-arenberg-forest\" target=\"_blank\">Trouée d’Arenberg</a> is <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/twas-the-night-before-roubaix-weekend\" target=\"_blank\">Paris-Roubaix</a>‘s most infamous sector, known for its punishing cobblestones. That doesn’t matter to goats. Last week, a herd descended on the cobblestones for lunch it as a form of eco-grazing. They’ll keep munching for a couple of weeks until the men’s Paris-Roubaix arrives on 9<sup>th</sup> April. Paris-Roubaix Femmes will take place the day before, but the women don’t ride the iconic sector. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dubbed ‘Les Biquettes de l’Espoir’ (Goats of Hope), the operation involves around 40 goats over 2,300m of cobblestones. I think it’s a brilliant idea. So does <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WoutvanAert/status/1636451286253010945\" target=\"_blank\">Wout van Aert</a>, who said he had two goats at home and to ‘DM for more info’. How many cyclists own goats? This demands an investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><em>Visit our hub page for more information about the ongoing <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/classics\" target=\"_blank\">Classics</a></em></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.

Only two men’s UCI Continental teams remain in the UK: Trinity Racing and Saint Piran.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most successful British Continental teams created, Bike Channel-Canyon was founded by Tim Elverson in 2017. Revamping to Canyon Eisberg, Canyon dhb p/b Soreen and WiV SunGod throughout the years, their highlights include Harry Tanfield’s sensational sprint victory on the opening stage of the 2018 Tour de Yorkshire and winning the overall Tour Series title in both 2018 and 2019. The Tour de Yorkshire no longer exists and the Tour Series will not run in 2023 also due to financial constraints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a personal note, they were the first team that I began writing freelance for, which helped kickstart my cycling journalism career. I will forever be thankful to the team, from Tim Elverson to photographer Hugh McManus and all the riders I interviewed over the years. I hope riders and staff can secure places at other teams, but we know how volatile the domestic racing scene can be. A horrible situation for all involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.
