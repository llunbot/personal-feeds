The streaming/in-person hybrid event will include new announcements about iOS, macOS, and much more—probably including Apple's new mixed reality headset. We'll be liveblogging all the updates as they happen right here.</p>\n<p>A few days ago, we shared our predictions for the event, and it looks to be a big one. Sure, it will focus on OS updates like usual, but we're also expecting a couple of new Mac models, possibly including a new, 15-inch variant of the MacBook Air.</p>\n<p>Of course, the elephant in the room is xrOS and Apple's long-rumored Reality Pro headset. There have been extensive leaks about the device, but we're still likely to learn some new things, including what kind of content will be available for it when it ultimately ships.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944266#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944266&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ba735ac9006c3df90ca176232b7e1b9d204f164c3d78e55d6a501b02e591ee2b","category":"Tech"}
