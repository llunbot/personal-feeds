The tool will attempt to thwart AI companies that crawl websites without permission to collect training data for large language models that power AI assistants like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/\">ChatGPT</a>.</p>\n<p>Cloudflare, founded in 2009, is probably best known as a company that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare\">provides</a> infrastructure and security services for websites, particularly protection against <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDoS_mitigation\">distributed denial-of-service</a> (DDoS) attacks and other malicious traffic.</p>\n<p>Instead of simply blocking bots, Cloudflare's new system lures them into a \"maze\" of realistic-looking but irrelevant pages, wasting the crawler's computing resources. The approach is a notable shift from the standard block-and-defend strategy used by most website protection services. Cloudflare says blocking bots sometimes backfires because it alerts the crawler's operators that they've been detected.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/cloudflare-turns-ai-against-itself-with-endless-maze-of-irrelevant-facts/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/cloudflare-turns-ai-against-itself-with-endless-maze-of-irrelevant-facts/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"30f1d860e2311b6dca07d6a1485f05dbe2e08bf0fa6d5e716295205dd18110f4","category":"Tech"}
