The <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/aws-community-day-poland/\">AWS Community Day Poland</a> was hosted last week with more than 600 cloud enthusiasts in attendance. Community speakers <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/agnieszka-biernacka-79186677/\">Agnieszka Biernacka</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/krzysztofkakol/\">Krzysztof Kąkol</a>, and more, presented talks which captivated the audience and resulted in vibrant discussions throughout the day. My teammate, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/afronski/\">Wojtek Gawroński</a>, was at the event and he’s already looking forward to attending again next year!</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/04/15/organizersspeakers-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/04/15/organizersspeakers-1-1024x689.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"689\" /></a></p> \n<p><span><strong>Last week’s launches</strong></span><br /> Here are some launches that got my attention during the previous week.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/04/amazon-cloudfront-oac-lambda-function-url-origins/\">Amazon CloudFront now supports Origin Access Control (OAC) for Lambda function URL origins</a> – Now you can protect your <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\">AWS Lambda</a> URL origins by using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/\">Amazon CloudFront</a> Origin Access Control (OAC) to only allow access from designated CloudFront distributions. The <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-lambda.html\">CloudFront Developer Guide</a> has more details on how to get started using CloudFront OAC to authenticate access to Lambda function URLs from your designated CloudFront distributions.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/aws-client-vpn-and-aws-verified-access-migration-and-interoperability-patterns/\">AWS Client VPN and AWS Verified Access migration and interoperability patterns</a> – If you’re using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/vpn/client-vpn\">AWS Client VPN</a> or a similar third-party VPN-based solution to provide secure access to your applications today, you’ll be pleased to know that you can now combine the use of AWS Client VPN and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/verified-access/\">AWS Verified Access</a> for your new or existing applications.</p> \n<p><strong>These two announcements related to Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock caught my eye:</strong></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/knowledge-bases-for-amazon-bedrock-now-supports-metadata-filtering-to-improve-retrieval-accuracy/\">Metadata filtering to improve retrieval accuracy</a> – With metadata filtering, you can retrieve not only semantically relevant chunks but a well-defined subset of those relevant chunks based on applied metadata filters and associated values.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/knowledge-bases-for-amazon-bedrock-now-supports-custom-prompts-for-the-retrieveandgenerate-api-and-configuration-of-the-maximum-number-of-retrieved-results/\">Custom prompts for the RetrieveAndGenerate API and configuration of the maximum number of retrieved results</a> – These are two new features which you can now choose as query options alongside the search type to give you control over the search results. These are retrieved from the vector store and passed to the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/foundation-models/\">Foundation Models</a> for generating the answer.</p> \n<p>For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">What’s New at AWS page</a>.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Other AWS news</strong></span><br /> AWS open source news and updates – My colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/094459\">Ricardo</a> writes this <a href=\"https://community.aws/content/2ea38u0x4DZ91l6BO2CoWHPo7rw/aws-open-source-newsletter-195\">weekly open source newsletter</a> in which he highlights new open source projects, tools, and demos from the AWS Community.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Upcoming AWS events</strong></span><br /> AWS Summits – These are free online and in-person events that bring the cloud computing community together to connect, collaborate, and learn about AWS.
