Some other electronic devices including video game consoles like the Nintendo Switch 2 are still subject to the tariffs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-12/trump-exempts-phones-computers-chips-from-reciprocal-tariffs\">Bloomberg</a></em> points out, the exemptions could be temporary and the Trump administration could be planning for new, lower tariffs on electronics and other goods from China. The order also does not exempt companies from the 20 percent \"fentanyl\" fee imposed on China, which was an earlier penalty, so there is still a fee that Apple will need to pay.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the back and forth over tariffs and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/09/apple-stock-up-tariff-pause/\">90-day pause</a> Trump put in place in some countries, Apple stock has been volatile for the last week and has dropped more than 20 percent before recovering somewhat.
