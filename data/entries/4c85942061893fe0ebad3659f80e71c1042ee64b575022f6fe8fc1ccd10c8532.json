{"title":"T-Mobile's 'Go5G Next' Plan Lets Customers Upgrade Smartphones Every Year","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/t-mobile-go5g-next-plan/","date":1692661612000,"content":"T-Mobile <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/news/un-carrier/t-mobile-unveils-go5g-next\">today announced</a> a new Go5G Next plan that is designed to allow subscribers to upgrade their smartphones on a yearly basis. The plan is available alongside the existing Go5G and Go5G Plus options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/t-mobile-go5g-next.jpg\" alt width=\"1250\" height=\"625\" />\r<br />\nCustomers who opt for Go5G Next will be able to get a smartphone with a no-interest phone payment plan, and once half the phone has been paid off, customers are eligible for an upgrade. T-Mobile says that in \"most cases\" customers will be able to update yearly.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen opting for a new phone, the old phone will be traded in, and T-Mobile will pay off the remaining payments to allow for a new payment contract to be adopted for the updated device. According to T-Mobile, the Go5G Next plan is also meant to ensure that existing customers receive the same \"great phone deals.\"<blockquote>Say a customer picks up a $1000 smartphone. Once they pay off half ($500), that customer can trade it in toward a new one, and T-Mobile covers the remaining $500 on the old phone. And new and existing customers on Go5G Next always get the same great deals whenever they're ready to upgrade.</blockquote>Go5G Next is priced at $100 for a single line with autopay (plus the cost of the smartphone payments), and it comes with 50GB of mobile hotspot data. T-Mobile's Go5G Next plans will be available starting on Thursday, and for a limited time, T-Mobile is offering three lines for $60/month per line.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/t-mobile/\">T-Mobile</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/t-mobile-go5g-next-plan/\">T-Mobile's 'Go5G Next' Plan Lets Customers Upgrade Smartphones Every Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/t-mobiles-go5g-next-plan-lets-customers-upgrade-smartphones-every-year.2399257/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4c85942061893fe0ebad3659f80e71c1042ee64b575022f6fe8fc1ccd10c8532","category":"Apple"}
