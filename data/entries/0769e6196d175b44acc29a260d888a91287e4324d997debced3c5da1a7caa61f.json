It is equipped with dual-display HDMI support at 4K 60Hz (or a single 8K display), a downstream Thunderbolt 4 port, a 10Gb/s USB-C port, two 10Gb/s USB-A ports, two 5Gb/s USB-A ports, SD and microSD card readers, a gigabit ethernet port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/plugable-dock-3.jpg\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1302\" />\r<br />\nThe dock supports up to 100W power delivery, so it is able to provide power to even the 16-inch MacBook Pro. While it can drive dual 4K displays at 60Hz through the Thunderbolt 4 port, this requires an M-series Pro or Max chip. 15W of power is available for charging peripheral devices such as an ‌iPad‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/plugable-dock-2.jpg\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" />\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CNTVH7CD\">Plugable's AMS-STAND11 Magnetic iPad Stand</a> is compatible with the 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ and the 10.9-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>. It is made from an aluminum alloy that matches well with the ‌iPad‌, and it includes strong N52 magnets and anti-slip silicone padding to keep the ‌iPad‌ in place.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/magnetic-ipad-stand-1.jpg\" width=\"1774\" height=\"998\" />\r<br />\nThe stand has a 180-degree adjustable hinged arm that supports multiple viewing angles, along with a 360-degree rotatable panel for swapping between landscape and portrait orientations. With the adjustable arm, the stand can be folded down so far that it turns into a suitable surface for drawing and sketching.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/magnetic-ipad-stand-2.jpg\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1465\" />\r<br />\nWhen not in use, the stand is able to fold flat, which makes it easy to transport and take to school or work. Plugable is selling the stand for $80, but there is a $5 coupon available to celebrate the stand's launch. For those with the larger ‌iPad Pro‌ model, there's <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CNTW1RTW\">also a 12.9-inch version</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe have an 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌, Thunderbolt 4 dock, and ‌iPad‌ stand for one lucky <em>MacRumors</em> reader.
