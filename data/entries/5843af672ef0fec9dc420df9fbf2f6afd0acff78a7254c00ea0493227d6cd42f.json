Well, DT Swiss has the solution for you – a premium World Tour-proven pro replica limited edition ARC 1100 Dicut 50mm SPO aero road wheelset with huge sponsor logos. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, this is just a cosmetic update to a fast wheelset that’s already been in the market for several years. But maybe the same super-fast tires the team races on will help sway you to get that pro look. ‘Look pro, even if you go slow’ is what roadies say these days, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>DT Swiss ARC 1100 Dicut 50 SPO Ltd White wheel tire system</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-ARC-1100-50-SPO-pro-replica-aero-carbon-road-wheels-with-huge-logos_photo-by-Ridley_Uno-X-team.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-ARC-1100-50-SPO-pro-replica-aero-carbon-road-wheels-with-huge-logos_photo-by-Ridley_Uno-X-team.webp\" alt=\"DT Swiss ARC 1100 50 SPO pro-replica aero carbon road wheels get huge logos, hand-built in Europe, just like for UNOP-X\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-ARC-1100-50-SPO-pro-replica-aero-carbon-road-wheels-with-huge-logos_photo-by-Ridley_Uno-X-team.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-ARC-1100-50-SPO-pro-replica-aero-carbon-road-wheels-with-huge-logos_photo-by-Ridley_Uno-X-team-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-ARC-1100-50-SPO-pro-replica-aero-carbon-road-wheels-with-huge-logos_photo-by-Ridley_Uno-X-team-80x120.webp 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-ARC-1100-50-SPO-pro-replica-aero-carbon-road-wheels-with-huge-logos_photo-by-Ridley_Uno-X-team-768x1152.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-ARC-1100-50-SPO-pro-replica-aero-carbon-road-wheels-with-huge-logos_photo-by-Ridley_Uno-X-team-1024x1536.webp 1024w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos/DT Swiss, Ridley &amp; UNO-X)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Forgive me for a minute because this is literally just a new set of oversized white decals on an aero carbon road wheelset that we first rode <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-impressions-up-close-in-the-wind-tunnel-w-dt-swiss-arc-aero-wheel-redesign/\" target=\"_blank\">4 1/2 years ago</a> with slightly smaller and mildly more discrete gray DT logos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure they are expensive.
