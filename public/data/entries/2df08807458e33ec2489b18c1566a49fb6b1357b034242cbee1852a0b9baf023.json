{"title":"AWS Week in Review – March 6, 2023","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-week-in-review-march-6-2023/","date":1678126769000,"content":"<p>It has been a week full of interesting launches and I am thrilled to be able to share them with you today. We’ve got a new region in the works, a new tool for researchers, updates to Amazon Timestream, Control Tower, and Amazon Inspector, Lambda Powertools for .NET, existing services in new locations, lots of posts from other AWS blogs, upcoming events, and more.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Last Week’s Launches</strong></span><br /> Here are some of the launches that caught my eye this past week:</p> \n<p><strong>AWS Region in Malaysia </strong>– We are working on an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-aws-region-in-malaysia/\">AWS Region in Malaysia</a>, bringing the number of regions that are currently in the works to five. The upcoming region will include three Availability Zones, and represents our commitment to invest at least $6 Billion in Malaysia by 2037. You can read my post to learn about how our enterprise, startup, and public sector customers are already using AWS.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Lightsail for Research</strong> – You <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-lightsail-for-research-with-all-in-one-research-environments/\">can get access to analytical applications</a> such as Scilab, RStudio, and Jupyter with just a couple of couple of clicks. Instead of processing large data sets on your laptop, you can get to work quickly without having to deal with hardware setup, software setup, or tech support.</p> \n<p><strong>Batch Loading of Data into Amazon Timestream</strong> – You can now <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/03/amazon-timestream-supports-batch-loading-data/\">batch-load time series data</a> into <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/timestream/\">Amazon Timestream</a>. You upload the data to an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a> bucket in CSV form, specify a target database and table, and a data model. The ingestion happens automatically and reliably, with parallel processes at work for efficiency.</p> \n<p><strong>Control Tower Progress Tracker</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/controltower/\">AWS Control Tower</a> now includes a<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/03/aws-control-tower-progress-tracker-landing-zone-setup-upgrades/\"> progress tracker</a> that shows you the milestones (and their status) of the landing zone setup and upgrade process. Milestones such as updating shared accounts for logging, configuring Account Factory, and enabling mandatory controls are tracked so that you have additional visibility into the status of your setup or upgrade process.</p> \n<p><strong>Kinesis Data Streams Throughput Increase</strong> – Each Amazon Kinesis Data Stream now <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/03/amazon-kinesis-data-streams-on-demand-write-throughput-1gb/\">supports</a> up to 1 GB/second of write throughput and 2 GB/second of read throughput, both in On-Demand capacity mode. To reach this level of throughput for your data streams you will need to submit a Support Ticket, as described in the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/03/amazon-kinesis-data-streams-on-demand-write-throughput-1gb/\">What’s New</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Lambda Powertools for .NET</strong> – This <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/02/aws-lambda-powertools-net-generally-available/\">open source developer library is now generally available</a>. It helps you to incorporate Well-Architected serverless best practices into your code, with a focus on observability features including distributed tracing, structured logging, and asynchronous metrics (both business and applications).</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Inspector Code Scans for Lambda Functions</strong> – This <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/02/code-scans-lambda-functions-amazon-inspector-preview/\">preview launch</a> gives <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/\">Amazon Inspector</a> the power to scan your <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\">AWS Lambda</a> functions for vulnerabilities such as injection flaws, data leaks, weak cryptography, or missing encryption. Findings are aggregated in the Amazon Inspector console, routed to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/\">AWS Security Hub</a>, and pushed to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge\">Amazon EventBridge</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>X in Y</strong> – We made existing services and features available in additional regions and locations:</p> \n<ul>
