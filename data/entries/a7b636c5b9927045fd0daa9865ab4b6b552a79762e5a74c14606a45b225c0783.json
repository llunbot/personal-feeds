The consulting company gathered data from more than 31,000 people across 30 countries as part of its 2025 Global Automotive Consumer Study, and some of the results are rather interesting, as they pertain to technologies like new powertrains, connectivity, and artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>Among US consumers, internal combustion engines (ICE) remain number one, with 62 percent indicating that their next car will not be electrified. Another one in five would like a hybrid for their next vehicle, with a further six percent desiring a plug-in hybrid. (The remaining survey respondents either did not know or wanted some other powertrain option.)</p>\n<p>By contrast, only 38 percent of Chinese consumers want to stick with ICE; meanwhile, 27 percent of them want a BEV next. That's a far higher percentage than in other large nationsâ€”in Germany, only 14 percent want a BEV; in the UK and Canada, only eight percent are BEV-bound; and in Japan, the number is a mere 3 percent.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/only-5-percent-of-us-car-buyers-want-an-ev-according-to-survey/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/only-5-percent-of-us-car-buyers-want-an-ev-according-to-survey/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
