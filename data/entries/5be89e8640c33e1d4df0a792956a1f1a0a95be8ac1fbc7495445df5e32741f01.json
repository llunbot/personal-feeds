{"title":"Designing Accessible Text Over Images: Best Practices, Techniques And Resources (Part 2)","link":"https://smashingmagazine.com/2023/08/designing-accessible-text-over-images-part2/","date":1691758800000,"content":"<p>What is the <em>text over images</em> design pattern? How do we apply this pattern to our designs without sacrificing legibility and readability?</p>\n<p>The text over images design pattern is a design technique used to place text on top of images. It is often used to provide information about the image or to serve as the main website navigation. However, this technique can quickly sacrifice legibility and readability if there is not enough contrast between the text and the image. To prevent this, designers need to ensure that the text and the image have a high enough contrast ratio to be legible and readable. Additionally, designers should also make sure the text is positioned in the right place, away from any image elements that might cause confusion, distraction, or make it difficult to read.</p>\n<blockquote>“Incorporating text with imagery is a balancing act. To create professional, compelling content, the image and text must reach a visual harmony. At the same time, strong contrast between text and image will increase legibility and will make your content stand out.”<br /><br />— “<a href=\"https://marketing.gettyimages.com/7-tips-for-overlaying-text-on-imagery/\">Tips for Overlaying Text on Imagery</a>,” Getty Images</blockquote>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/08/designing-accessible-text-over-images-part1/\">Part 1 of the series</a>, we have reviewed in detail five techniques (using an overlay over the entire image, text with scrim overlay, strips/highlight, copy space, and text over blurred background effect) and now we’ll continue with reviewing in detail five more (frame the image, soft-colored gradients, text styles and text position, solid color shapes, use of colored backgrounds). In the end, I will also provide you with a long list of useful tools and resources related to this accessibility topic.</p>\nFrame That Image\n<p>Another simple design technique you can try is by <strong>framing the image</strong> in a flat-colored shape that includes your text. This kind of style is mostly used in thumbnails and cards.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-accessible-text-over-images-part2/smashing-text-over-images-technique-frame.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4>Examples From The Wild</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://july.fund/\"><strong>July Fund</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-accessible-text-over-images-part2/smashing-text-over-images-technique-frame-july-fund.jpg\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ablspacesystems.com/\"><strong>ABL Space Systems</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-accessible-text-over-images-part2/smashing-text-over-images-technique-frame-ablespace.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4>Additional Resources On This Topic</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://bentogrids.com/\">Bento Grids</a><br />Bento Grids is a nice curated collection of tiles-based layouts (that were initially popularized by Apple).

These soft-colored gradients are created when two or more different colors are blended to create a soft and gentle transition from one color to another. They are commonly used on websites and page designs to make them look modern and creative.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-accessible-text-over-images-part2/smashing-text-over-images-technique-soft-colored-gradients.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4>Examples From The Wild</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://porto-128.webflow.io/\"><strong>Porto 128</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-accessible-text-over-images-part2/smashing-text-over-images-technique-soft-gradients-porto.jpg\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://perfectday.com/better-for-everything/\"><strong>Perfect Day</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-accessible-text-over-images-part2/smashing-text-over-images-technique-soft-gradients-perfect-day.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4>Additional resources on this topic</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://angrytools.com/gradient/image/\">Gradient Maker</a> (by Angry Tools)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cssgradient.io/\">CSS Gradients Generator</a> (by Designstripe)</li>\n</ul>\nPlay Around With Text Styles And Text Position\n<p>Achieving the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum\">1.4.3 success criterion</a> might be difficult even if we have used some of the techniques outlined in the examples above, or when any combination of those techniques still fails. In such cases, one of the safest options is to play around with <strong>text styles</strong> and with the <strong>text position outside</strong> of the image.</p>\n<p>Various text styles (bigger or smaller text; emphasize, low-key, bold, regular, or light text style; playing with margins and letter spacing, etc.) and combining these text styles in different ways may help you achieve a powerful impact with regards to your design while not sacrificing any accessibility. You can also position your text to the left or right, the top or bottom, and you’ll have an accessible and visually appealing website or app.</p>\n<p>This technique is great if you combine your text styling techniques and play around with the images. With text positioned outside of the image, you have control over how to make it more accessible by using real text that can be zoomed in to maximum for those people who may have trouble reading small text on the screen or for those who wish to use their voice assistants.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-accessible-text-over-images-part2/smashing-text-over-images-technique-placement.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4>Examples From The Wild</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://bolimowek.pl/en/home-en/\"><strong>Bolimówek</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-accessible-text-over-images-part2/smashing-text-over-images-technique-placement-bolimowek.jpg\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://mytorontocondo.com/\"><strong>My Toronto Condo</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-accessible-text-over-images-part2/smashing-text-over-images-technique-placement-bibby.jpg\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.scribelytribe.com/\"><strong>Scribely</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-accessible-text-over-images-part2/smashing-text-over-images-technique-placement-scribely.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4>Additional Resources On This Topic</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/design-considerations-text-images/\">Design Considerations: Text on Images</a>,” by Chris Coyier (CSS Tricks)</li>\n</ul>\nPlay With Solid Shapes\n<p>Using only <strong>simple shapes</strong> can make a lot of difference.

This technique facilitates screen readers to read actual text instead of images, hence enhancing accessibility for visually impaired users. Furthermore, using this technique, you can adapt the text to meet your user's preferences, optimize it for various screen sizes, and even adjust the size or zoom level without compromising its quality.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, with this technique, you can easily customize real text according to the user’s requirements, such as colors or styles, and much more. It might be difficult to achieve this criterion in certain circumstances, but giving users an option to customize those things instead of using images would be better for everyone involved, and that is why this technique does not require much effort on your part at all.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-accessible-text-over-images-part2/smashing-text-over-images-technique-gradients.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4>Examples From The Wild</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://bou.co/\"><strong>Bou</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-accessible-text-over-images-part2/smashing-text-over-images-technique-colored-bg-bou.jpg\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.studio-5b.com/\"><strong>Studio 5B</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-accessible-text-over-images-part2/smashing-text-over-images-technique-colored-bg-studio5b.jpg\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.koryun.am/\"><strong>Koryun</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-accessible-text-over-images-part2/smashing-text-over-images-technique-colored-bg-koryun.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4>Additional Resources On This Topic</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://cssgradient.io/\">CSS Gradients Generator</a> (by Designstripe)</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://fossheim.io/writing/posts/css-text-gradient/\">How to add a gradient overlay to text with CSS</a>,” a tutorial by Sarah Fossheim</li>\n</ul>\nJust Use The Actual Text!\n<p>Lastly, while all of these design techniques will help you make the text over images more accessible, I still think that using the <strong>actual text</strong> is the way to go.</p>\n<p>Providing special care to ensure that text over an image remains perfectly readable and accessible is a must, and, as you have seen in sections <strong>1</strong> — <strong>10</strong> of the article, there are plenty of design techniques for that purpose. But again, if you want to make your website or mobile app accessible right from the start, why not simplify things a bit and do it properly? Use real text, make sure there is plenty of contrast between the text and the background, and make your website or app accessible to everyone.</p>\n<p>Using text over images provides a combination of benefits, and yet it has some limitations. Text placed over images is harder to read for visually impaired users, especially at smaller text sizes, because the content gets more compressed. There are also some accessibility requirements for different colors under the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html\">WCAG 2.1 guidelines</a>. If you have trouble implementing the success criterion mentioned in the design techniques we’ve presented, ditching everything and just using real text will do the trick.</p>\nConclusion\n<p>As with any new design trends popping out in different places, we need to make sure that what we’re creating is not only pretty but is also helping our users. Always consider the accessibility aspect to be “baked in” right from the start rather than being an afterthought in your design process.</p>\n<p>In any case, if someone asks you why the real text is better to use rather than text over images or images of text, here are a few key things to remember:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real text can be zoomed in to any size without distortion and pixelation, and (what’s also very important) it can be read by assistive tech software.</li>\n<li>Additionally, you can easily increase the contrast of the text, which will help your users access the content easier.</li>\n<li>With actual text, you have the freedom to create your own styling and make use of CSS to format the text elements. I can highly recommend you to read the very detailed hands-on tutorial on how to use CSS styling, “<a href=\"https://ishadeed.com/article/handling-text-over-image-css/\">Handling Text Over Images in CSS</a>” by Ahmad Shadeed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you for joining me in this accessibility journey.
