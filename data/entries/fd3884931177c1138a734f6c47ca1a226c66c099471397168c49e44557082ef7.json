The platform is finally given a CFR tier to match its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/canyon-ultimate-review\" target=\"_blank\">Ultimate</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/canyon-aeroad-cfr-first-ride-review-canyon-s-fastest-bike-ever\" target=\"_blank\">Aeroad</a> stablemates, said to be around 100g lighter than the CF SLX tier, and the bike acquires their width and height adjustable front-end design too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Endurace CF SLX tier adopts the same frameset design as the totally new CFR bikes, while the intermediate CF SL tier has been dropped, creating distinctions between the high-end and low-end models in the Endurace range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-cycling-tyres-the-best-tyres-for-all-occasions\" target=\"_blank\">Tyre </a>clearance joins the cheaper Endurace bikes in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-endurance-road-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">all-road</a> territory at 35mm and the relaxed <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-bike-geometry-handling\" target=\"_blank\">geometry</a> is unchanged, but otherwise the high-end Endurace designs are a claimed 7 watts faster at 45kmh and feature a hatch in the top tube to house a tool sleeve, where the CF and AL bikes have a simpler top tube mount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the range being only partially overhauled there have still been eight new models added to it, all available in eight sizes. Prices start at £3,499/€3,699 for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/shimano-105-di2\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano 105 Di2</a>-equipped CF SLX Di2 model and rise to £9,499/€9,999 for the CFR WRL, which uses Campagnolo’s new <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/campagnolo-super-record-wireless-groupset\" target=\"_blank\">Super Record Wireless groupset</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/campagnolo-bora-ultra-wto\" target=\"_blank\">Bora Ultra WTO wheels</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon gave <em>Cyclist</em> the opportunity to ride the Endurace CFR ahead of its launch, so be sure to check out our first ride report on the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>High-performance comfort</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Endurace bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Tom Andrew</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>More recent updates to the Ultimate and Aeroad platforms has consequently meant the Endurace has lagged behind slightly in performance terms at the high-end, as Canyon’s race bikes are offered in a ‘CFR’ tier that sits above the highest CF SLX tier the Endurance was previously offered in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand says CFR bikes use its most premium materials and construction techniques to reduce frame weight, while preserving other performance characteristics such as aerodynamics and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-frame-stiffness\" target=\"_blank\">stiffness</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘In this revision, we’ve applied the same level of engineering to Endurace as we have to our Aeroad and Ultimate bikes,’ says Canyon. ‘The CFR tier delivers class-leading stiffness-to-weight, coming in around 100g less than the new Endurace CF SLX.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aerodynamic improvements to the frameset’s tube profiles complement its lighter weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Aero optimisation is a benefit for all riders not just pros,’ says the brand. ‘What’s more, the longer you ride for, the more it matters.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To that end, Canyon says it leveraged its now long-standing relationship with aerodynamicists SwissSide to introduce some drag reducing features to the new Endurace, albeit not at the ultimate expense of comfort or handling. For example, the fork blades are now deeper, and the down tube is narrower in width. Canyon says the changes amount to a seven-watt saving at 45kmh over the old bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Adjustable integration</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-7-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Endurace bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-7-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-7-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-7-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-7-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-7-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-7-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-7-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-7.jpg 1400w\" /><figcaption>Canyon</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as in the new Specialized Tarmac SL8, the inclusion of an integrated cockpit was key in the bike’s increased aerodynamic efficiency. Just like the CFR frameset tier, Canyon’s CP0018 cockpit was pioneered in the Aeroad and then the Ultimate, now making its way onto the Endurace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new front end is said to reduce drag by not only hiding cables inside the frame, but also by permitting a narrow head tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon achieves both by employing a unique stem/headset/fork steerer assembly, though which the cables run. Bar height can be adjusted as the stem element of the cockpit is similar to quill stems of old, where part of it slides over the steerer tube. The clamping mechanism is a grub screw coming through the back of the stem, so to change stem height all a rider or mechanic need do is loosen said screw and slide the stem up or down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spacers are the puzzle type, which lock together in two pieces and hence can be removed without disassembling the front end. Per frame size, stem height can be adjusted by up to 15mm in 5mm increments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite an equally clean look, the bar portion is adjustable too. It is effectively three pieces slotted together. The middle of the bar is a T-section – the ‘stem’ plus a section of the bar tops – and into each side of this slots a left or right ‘wing’ – the other section of the bar tops plus drops. These can be bolted together in three positions, creating 40mm of width adjustment in 20mm increments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking bar width and stem height together, 12 positions can be created out of a single component, and the detachable wings aim to make packing a bike easier too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A torque wrench, T25 Torx key and 4mm Allen key are the tools required to adjust the CP0018 cockpit, and every bike ships with them supplied as standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Capability and utility</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first generation Endurace was released in 2014 with the aim to provide a design that was comfortable to ride over long distances on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon says that features have since been added to augment that primary goal, and the latest Endurace bikes take things on a step again.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-8-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Endurace bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-8-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-8-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-8-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-8-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-8-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-8-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-8-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-8.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Canyon</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Endurace’s top tube frame hatch is one such example.

As such, the bikes retain the brand’s well-regarded S15 VCLS 2.0 post, which uses a dual leaf spring-esque design to promote fore-aft compliance at the saddle, but add in the 35mm tyre clearance introduced in the lower-end update early last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This opens up the potential to do some light off-roading with the bike – there are no ‘all-road’ builds in this revamp but the CF tier has one available – though if anything Canyon seems to have steered the higher end builds more towards road performance, by speccing DT Swiss’ mid-depth ERC wheels on several builds and giving one CF SLX build an ‘Aero’ suffix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the ERC wheels are <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-gravel-bike-rim-width\" target=\"_blank\">modernly wide</a>, and the tyres that wrap them are appropriately voluminous too. The new CF SLX and CFR builds echo the cheaper models by going with a staggered 30mm front/32mm rear pairing. This feature was once again first introduced on Canyon’s Aeroad, as the brand claims the thinner narrower tyre helps with aerodynamics while the wider rear helps comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sizes fit for all</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-2-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Endurace bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-2.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Tom Andrew</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new bikes continue with Canyon’s ‘Sport’ geometry, which makes use of a higher stack and shorter reach than the brand’s Ultimate and Aeroad race bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon likes to use stack-to-reach ratios to describe the different fits of its bikes: the new Endurace’s ratio is 1.56, compared to 1.45 for the Ultimate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A higher ratio creates a body position that is more upright, which Canyon says more riders should find comfortable to maintain for long periods as it reduces pressure on the lower back, core and shoulders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, handling geometry is said to reflect Canyon’s racier bikes to ensure the Endurace remains engaging to ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compounding the benefits of the Endurace’s accessible fit is the unusually broad size range that Canyon offers in the bike. The brand claims the Endurace’s eight sizes will suit riders from 152cm to over 200cm in height, and the smallest two sizes use 650B wheels to ensure handling is not compromised.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>For more information on the new Endurace range, <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/road-bikes/endurance-bikes/endurace/\" target=\"_blank\">visit canyon.com</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Endurace range overview</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-6-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Endurace bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-6-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-6-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-6-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-6-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-6-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-6-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-6-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/canyon_endurace_cfr_news-6.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Tom Andrew</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the Endurace range not being overhauled entirely, there are still eight models that use the new frameset. The most expensive three bikes use Canyon’s CFR tier composite blend in their framesets, while the remaining five use Canyon’s CF SLX material blend. This adds a little extra weight to the frameset but should otherwise by similar in performance terms, and the two tiers are identical in shape. All bikes use Canyon’s adjustable CP0018 Aerocockpit and come in eight sizes: 3XS, 2XS, XS, S, M, L, XL, 2XL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers will get the option of all three main groupset makers on the CFR level bikes, which all use Schwalbe Pro One tyres in different widths – 30mm front, 32mm rear. The Shimano and SRAM builds both come with DT Swiss ERC 1100 wheels and power meters and are available in the same two colour options, while the Campagnolo build uses Super Record Wireless and Bora Ultra WTO wheels, with no power meter but a special edition paint scheme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CF SLX models use either Shimano or SRAM groupsets and Continental GP5000 S TR tyres, again at staggered widths of 30mm front, 32mm rear. At the CF SLX 8 level, SRAM-equipped bikes get <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-force-axs-review\" target=\"_blank\">Force AXS</a> and a Quarq power meter and are £300 more expensive, while the Shimano build use Ultegra Di2 and a 4iiii power meter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two Shimano-based CF SLX 8 models: an ‘Aero’ one that uses DT Swiss ERC 1400 wheels (shared by the Force AXS CF SLX 8 model) and a ‘Di2’ one, that uses DT Swiss’ lower profile Endurance LN wheels. The Di2 build is considerably cheaper than the Aero build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano and SRAM’s third tier groupsets outfit the CF SLX 7 bikes, which are dressed in 105 Di2 and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-rival-etap-axs-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Rival AXS</a> respectively.
