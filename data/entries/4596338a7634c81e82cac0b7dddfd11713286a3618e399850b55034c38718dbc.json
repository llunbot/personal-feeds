The small flyer has done so well that it has been separated from Perseverance for some time as it scouts ahead on the red planet.</p>\n<p>Ingenuity completed its latest flight on Monday, ascending to 10 meters and flying 450 meters across Mars to investigate what scientists call the “South Séítah” region of Mars. The helicopter was aloft for a total of 169 seconds during Monday's flight. In its dozen flights, Ingenuity has now covered 2.67 km, which is farther than Perseverance has rolled during nearly six months.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787711#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787711&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4596338a7634c81e82cac0b7dddfd11713286a3618e399850b55034c38718dbc","category":"Tech"}
