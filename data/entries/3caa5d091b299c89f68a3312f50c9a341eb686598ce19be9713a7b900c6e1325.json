The update doesn’t appear to offer any additional enhancements and is recommended for all users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Apple’s security content page, the two fixes are the same as the ones patched in iOS 16.4.1 and iPadOS 16.4.1 last week. It is only for the following devices: iPhone 6s (all models), iPhone 7 (all models), iPhone SE (1st generation), iPad Air 2, iPad mini (4th generation), and iPod touch (7th generation). </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>IOSurfaceAccelerator</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Impact: An app may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.

Apple generally releases security update for older iPhones alongside larger iOS updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675021/how-long-does-apple-support-iphones.html\">How long Apple supports iPhones for</a>.</p>\n\niOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3caa5d091b299c89f68a3312f50c9a341eb686598ce19be9713a7b900c6e1325","category":"Apple"}
