A report from the University of Illinois reveals that Americans buy about <a href=\"https://guides.library.illinois.edu/battery-recycling\">3 billion</a> dry-cell batteries annually, which means that an average American ends up using nearly 10 batteries a year. Of course, this shouldn’t come as a surprise given that almost everything we use runs on batteries. What’s shocking is that out of these billions of batteries, <a href=\"https://www.connecticutchildrens.org/ear-nose-and-throat/what-to-do-if-your-child-swallows-or-ingests-a-button-battery/#:~:text=Every%20year%2C%20about%202%2C500%20kids,stomach%2C%20it%20can%20be%20fatal.\">about 2,500</a> end up in the stomachs of kids.</p>\n<p>Almost every day, there are numerous cases of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/05/tummy-problems-just-swallow-this-stomach-repairing-origami-robot-made-of-meat/\">kids swallowing batteries</a> that power their toys, watches, or gadgets; this results in many cases of internal injuries or stomach infections.</p>\n<p>A team of researchers at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Milan recently created a fully rechargeable battery using nontoxic edible components. This is probably the world’s first battery that is safe to ingest and entirely made of food-grade materials. “Given the level of safety of these batteries, they could be used in children's toys, where there is a high risk of ingestion,” <a href=\"https://opentalk.iit.it/en/a-rechargeable-battery-made-from-food/\">said</a> Mario Caironi, a senior researcher at IIT. However, this isn’t the only solution the edible battery could provide.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937723#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937723&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3a5d6efcdd4b33472ab2c8f079c2cc02a8a84e52302fb3d8214325a97b301a03","category":"Tech"}
