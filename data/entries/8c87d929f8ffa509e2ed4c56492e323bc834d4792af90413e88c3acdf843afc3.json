What you need is a Mac cleaner app that will delete the clutter and digital debris from your system and free your RAM from memory hogs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the Best Mac Cleaner?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Best Mac Cleaner for you depends on what you want to use it for. Just looking for a quick and easy way to free up some space so that the latest version of macOS will install? You probably want something that doesn’t cost a lot for a one off use. Looking for something that won’t just clear space, but will also help you free up memory/RAM, diagnose problems, and even check for viruses, we have the solutions below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We like CleanMyMac because there is the choice of a yearly subscription or a one time purchase price if you think you might want to keep it for the long haul.

Version 5.0 sports a redesigned interface that simplifies things by displaying the results of its scans as a series of tiles that give you a quick summary of each scan. </p>\n\n<p>CleanMyMac’s tools fall into five main categories that focus on different tasks: Cleanup, Protection, Performance, Applications and My Clutter. A new Smart Care feature gives your Mac a quick check-up and summarises the result of its scans for all five categories.</p>\n\n<p>The Cleanup tools focus on deleting junk. The Protection tools can scan for malware, detecting and quarantining threats. CleanMyMac isn’t a dedicated antivirus program like those featured in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668850/best-mac-antivirus-software.html\">Best Antivirus for Mac</a> round-up, but it’s a nice addition. </p>\n\n<p>The Performance tools help with routine maintenance, such as clearing out DNS cache, or re-indexing Spotlight and Mail to speed up search results. The Applications tools help you delete unwanted applications and left over installation files. </p>\n\n<p>My Clutter can scan either individual folders or your entire Mac drive to locate old files. Version 5 adds the ability to identify duplicate files, or photos that look very similar, so that you can delete them.</p>\n\n<p>There are also some new diagnostic tools, including the ability to identify apps that are using a lot of battery power.</p>\n\n<p>You can buy CleanMyMac from MacPaw’s own website, or from the Mac App Store, although the version sold on the Mac App Store omits a few features. You can choose from an annual subscription, or you can buy it for a one-time fee. It’s not the cheapest cleanup app, but it provides dozens of different tools for deleting old files and data. </p>\n\n<p>There’s a <a href=\"https://macpaw.audw.net/c/312327/63812/1733\">free version available to download</a> and a free trial version available on <a href=\"https://macpaw.com/cleanmymac\" target=\"_blank\">MacPaw’s website</a>, but it restricts the app to only remove files up to a maximum of 500MB – and in the middle of deleting files it will demand you pay the license fee for the app. You can download that limited version and scan your Mac to see just now much space you can save before committing to buying the app. MacPaw is currently running a 30% discount for students – submit your university email address and receive a download code <a href=\"https://macpaw.com/macpaw-student-discount\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://macpaw.com/store/cleanmymac\" target=\"_blank\">You can get CleanMyMac here</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/352922/cleanmymac-x-review-macos.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCleanMyMac review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.

It offers easy notifications and access as to what’s eating drive space (i.e., log files, cache files, trash, browser data, mail cache, mobile apps, iTunes temp files, iOS device backups, and old updates) and offers a nice level of control as to clearing them out. Clean Drive also offers quick access to the macOS Storage pane, which tends to be overlooked, and allows you to adjust your storage preferences on the fly.</p>\n\n<p>The Free Memory tool notifies you as to where your Mac’s RAM/Unified Memory is going, which applications are using the majority of it, and allows you to mark the amount of free memory in macOS’ Menu Bar.</p>\n\n<p>The Uninstall tool can fully uninstall Mac apps, along with any related files that may be scattered around your Mac’s drive. You can go through a list of installed applications on your Mac, pick and choose what to remove, and reliably strip out both the app and its support files.

The modules performed well during testing, and were able to locate large files and duplicates to be disposed of.</p>\n\n<p>The Smart Scan, as expected, goes through a general overview of storage, diagnostics, and applications to suss out garbage files and make recommendations as to what tools to use. The Junk Files module found a variety of unused disk images and installers. </p>\n\n<p>The Disk Map module worked as expected, offering a nice layout and concise display of what’s eating up your Mac’s hard drive. The Startup Manager offered an excellent peek under your Mac’s hood, especially in terms of launch agents, the module allowing you to activate or deactivate individual components</p>\n\n<p>File Shredder allows you to drop in files and folders to be securely deleting. The Dropbox Scanner tool, which hooked into my Dropbox account, compared files and file sizes, and offered a quick means of cleaning up larger files, which helped clear dozens of gigabytes of space and proved to be pretty unique as a feature.</p>\n\n<p>Cleaner One Pro is useful, lives up to its description, and offers an elegant and easy to navigate user interface that lets you prune your Mac down effectively.

This module has been improved compared to version 3, and now offers you easier access to startup programs and extension files, allowing you to enable, disable, or remove them. A Remaining Files feature allows you to chase down loose files, while an Open With feature lets you assign applications to open certain file types.</p>\n\n<p>With Duplicate File Finder it’s easy to specify file types to look for, such as audio and photo files, with an impressive level of precise control. Memory Cleaner module offers an easy interface to show which applications and processes are consuming the most RAM.

Some modules go beyond expectations. However, care and customisation is needed to avoid accidentally deleting important files.</p>\n\n<p>Avast Cleanup Premium for Mac is divided into modules: Quick Clean, Clean Clutter, Clean Browser, Find Duplicates, Analyse Photos, Uninstall Apps, Startup Manager, System Monitor, and Statistics. The Quick Clean module is the most generic and helps reclaim hard drive space by cleaning app cache, log files, trash, cookies, and web cache files.</p>\n\n<p>The Find Duplicates feature finds and organises duplicates on your system, giving you control over the process. The Analyse Photos module scans local and external photo libraries and volumes, identifying rough copies of old photos and offering to delete them.</p>\n\n<p>The Uninstall Apps, Startup Manager, System Monitor, and Statistics modules are unexpected gems. The Startup Manager module easily located 51 startup items that could be toggled on or off. The System Monitor offered a good user interface and layout, monitoring system sensors like fan speed, power usage, and battery condition.</p>\n\n<p>However, Avast Cleanup Premium for Mac has some issues. Setting up took an extra day due to a server-side error. The software automatically opts into third-party product offers unless you disable this option in the Privacy tab, which is annoying.</p>\n\n<p>But more concerning, is how powerful and broad the modules are: using the generic cleanup function without specifying what you want to clean up can be risky, especially when the browser cleaner removes generic cookies and autofill items, which can be useful later. Be cautious when using these tools, as they can accidentally remove files you might need.</p>\n\n<p>Avast’s utilities are effective and stand on their own. There’s something worth trying here. The software, especially with its 60-day free trial, is worth considering. A free version with a scan function is also available.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2655777/avast-cleanup-premium-for-mac-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAvast Cleanup Premium for Mac review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6.

I was able to clear up dozens of gigabytes of space in the process. See our round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/231363/the-best-cloud-storage-services-for-apple-users-2.html\">best cloud backups for Mac</a>. </p>\n\n<p>We did have some difficulties with Google Drive, which refused to allow DaisyDisk access, stating that the app was blocked and “tried to access sensitive info in your Google Account.

It is a duplicate removal tool that focuses specifically on reducing the thousands of duplicate photos in your Photos library. It also hunts down duplicate files within Apple Music and across the macOS operating system. The app is available through Apple’s App Store and MacPaw’s <a href=\"https://macpaw.com/setapp\" target=\"_blank\">SetApp</a> application, which grants access to Gemini and other apps for $9.99 (£7.60) a month. It is easy to install and offers a seven-day free trial in exchange for either your credit or debit card information.</p>\n\n<p>The app includes scripts for easy scanning of the Photos library and your Music library, as well as custom folders and external volumes that can be chosen from a menu or dragged, dropped, and quickly scanned. Other features include Menu Bar elements, whitelists that can be created that are exempt from being scanned, and a Duplicate Monitor feature that helps compare files and heads off duplicates before they begin to pile up.</p>\n\n<p>In testing, Gemini 2 quickly sought out duplicates, offered the option to remove them, and eradicated them from our hard drive. This also applies to music files and other document types, and the Duplicate Monitor warns you about possible duplicates that have been carried over to your hard drive.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are some caveats, such as confusion about account registration and permissions after downloading and installing Gemini 2 from the App Store. MacPaw is urging its clients towards SetApp subscriptions, which offer full access to the company’s apps for a given rate per month.</p>\n\n<p>While Gemini 2 runs well, a scheduling feature for folder or volume scans would not go amiss. An improved filter for locating duplicate items would be more helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Despite some minor hurdles, Gemini 2 is well-written, sharp, helpful, fast, works well with all kinds of duplicates, and lends a good feature set to the macOS operating system without being overbearing. It hones in on its tasks and performs them well enough to earn the trust of users.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2434914/gemini-2-duplicate-file-finder-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMacPaw Gemini review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10.

Less standard was that we had to locate the Intego Washing Machine X9 app in the Applications folder and drag it into Full Disk Access in Privacy and Security settings to get it to function. It is more common that an installer will add an easy icon that can be dragged into the macOS Full Disk Access pane to complete the installation.</p>\n\n<p>There’s a good level of customization. Like similar applications, the Reclaim tool can chase after caches, downloads, language files, logs, and trash files to help clean up disk space. The initial run cleared approximately 24GB of drive space from my M2 MacBook Pro’s SSD.</p>\n\n<p>The Duplicates tool took about five hours to create an initial index for my 1TB SSD. It offered control over duplicates that can be selected and specific options and naming filters.</p>\n\n<p>The Organize feature can help organize messy folders into a Snapshot folder for reorganization later. This tool can work with specific folders such as the ever-messy Desktop folder, your Home folder, and macOS’ Smart Folders, and help pull things into order. This Organize feature does feel like slapping a band-aid on the larger problem of a folder’s disorganization though.<br />The Scheduling option only allows for a specific week or month to be chosen, and it would have been nice to be able to schedule a process for a few minutes from now, as is common with similar software.</p>\n\n<p>While it’s nice to be able to reclaim a few dozen gigabytes of drive space and have control over the duplicate files on your Mac, Washing Machine offers nothing groundbreaking.</p>\n\n<p>With the current discounts and its attractive user interface it’s worth a look though. Alternatively, Intego’s Washing Machine X9 is bundled with Intego’s larger security suite so you could take advantage of that and get a Mac Cleaner with Intego’s Antivirus solution.

The Startup Programs module provides a convenient list of startup applications, categorised into All Programs, Active, and Disabled, and lets users select which to remove. The Extensions module categorises Mac extensions into Installation Files, Web Browser Extensions, Screen Savers, Settings Panes, Internet Plugins, and Widgets, making it easy to locate and remove specific extensions.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, App Cleaner &amp; Uninstaller’s Remaining Files and Updater elements are problematic. The Remaining Files module, though useful, offers a generalised ‘Remove’ feature that can remove critical system elements like the App Store, affecting your Mac’s functionality.</p>\n\n<p>During testing, it targeted Adobe Creative Cloud applications and files, removing file systems and requiring reinstallation of several Adobe applications. While a generalised cleanup is possible, the Remaining Files module should be used carefully to avoid removing critical elements. The Updates feature missed major updates like ff-Works, Slack, and Microsoft Office. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2688230/nektony-app-cleaner-uninstaller-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNektony App Cleaner &amp; Uninstaller review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>You may also like to consider:<br /><a href=\"https://fiplab.com/apps/disk-doctor-for-mac%20and%20https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/disk-doctor-system-cleaner/id455970963?mt=12\">Disk Doctor</a>, $2.99/£2.99 a year.<br /><a href=\"https://www.avg.com/en-us/avg-tuneup-for-mac#mac\">Tuneup for Mac</a>, $65.99/£54.99 a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have also looked at MacBooster, find out why we don’t recommend it here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2424786/macbooster-review.html\">MacBooster Review: it’s no surprise people think it’s malware.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we test Mac Cleaning software</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We tested the Mac cleaning software for this article by scanning our test system for junk files, caches, temporary files and more that could be removed. We then evaluated success depending not only on the amount of space freed up, but also whether there were issues related to data loss or performance slowdowns. We also evaluating the various modules in each app, such as the effectiveness of app uninstallers and the management of RAM. We also looked at ease of use and value for money.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why you should trust Macworld</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Macworld’s Mac cleaner app reviewer, Chris Barylick, is an Apple-Certified Macintosh Technician with more than twenty years of experience fixing Macs and in this time has seen just about every scenario that can be conceived of. You can trust the unbiassed recommendations and buying advice of Macworld’s team of experts because we use the products ourselves, running real-world tests to accurately assess how the software will perform in typical use.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to choose the best Mac Cleaner</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The best Mac Cleaner for you will depend on your requirements. Some of the options here do so much more than remove obsolete files from your Mac to free up space. Others promise to uninstall app completely, some will help you free up RAM, and some will even double up as antivirus software. The Mac Cleaner that meets your needs within you budget is the one that will best suit you and you can rest assumed that any app mentioned in this round up that fits your criteria comes with our recommendation.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><h2> FAQ </h2><hr />\n<div><div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>Can you clean your Mac without using a Mac Cleaner?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>macOS doesn’t have a built-in system cleaner, but with a little knowhow you can do the job yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is possible to clean your Mac for free, however there are risks involved. There’s a reason why Apple doesn’t let you access the contents of System Data: if you delete the wrong thing it could bring down your whole Mac!

OnyX is a free utility that provides access to powerful tools for cleaning and maintenance of the macOS operating system</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of these trials will merely show you how much space you can free up, but several are essentially free Mac Cleaners that will allow you to clean your Mac for free, albeit for a limited period.
