When using ‌CarPlay‌ or Android Auto, the user's phone has no knowledge of the vehicle's charge state, and GM believes that forcing users to use the built-in Google-based system which can account for this information will deliver a better user experience.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGolson says that given this is not a technical decision, GM could update the infotainment system on the Escalade IQ and other upcoming EVs to add ‌CarPlay‌ and Android Auto if it finds customers are demanding it, but there are no guarantees about what GM will do.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile GM's argument about tighter integration with vehicle data does have some merit, there is nothing preventing the company from offering users the option of using either the built-in system or ‌CarPlay‌/Android Auto, as is the case in millions of vehicles on the road today.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/next-generation-carplay-multi-display.jpg\" alt width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" /><em>Apple's next-generation ‌CarPlay‌</em></div>\r<br />\nIt also appears the argument could largely become moot with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/28/next-generation-carplay-features/\">next-generation version of CarPlay</a> teased by Apple at WWDC 2022, which integrates very closely with vehicle systems and expands the ‌CarPlay‌ experience across the entire dashboard. We should learn more about next-generation ‌CarPlay‌ and see the first vehicles introduced with it later this year, but GM is not included in the list of over a dozen brands announced by Apple as partners on the feature.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/gm/\">GM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cadillac/\">Cadillac</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/11/gm-no-technical-reason-carplay/\">GM Admits No Technical Reason CarPlay Couldn't Be in Future EVs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gm-admits-no-technical-reason-carplay-couldnt-be-in-future-evs.2398390/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0f146d6192dfa6fa1256bfe41928295e713ef217f089e7fc6eadf7246890e81b","category":"Apple"}
