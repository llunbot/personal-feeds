Closed, it is just 16.5mm (0.65″) in diameter and 127mm (5″) long making it easy to pop into a pocket or even a saddlebag. Then unfolded, it becomes a 91mm (3.6″) long T-handle wrench to reach tricky bolts, with a 86mm (3.4″) long arm to get plenty of leverage for low torque applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_photo-Rupert-Fowler-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Winter_bits-packed-inside.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_photo-Rupert-Fowler-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Winter_bits-packed-inside.webp\" alt=\"Feedback Sports compact, folding 2-8Nm Range Twist Torque Tool T-handle wrench, 4mm bits inside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_photo-Rupert-Fowler-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Winter_bits-packed-inside.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_photo-Rupert-Fowler-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Winter_bits-packed-inside-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_photo-Rupert-Fowler-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Winter_bits-packed-inside-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_photo-Rupert-Fowler-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Winter_bits-packed-inside-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_photo-Rupert-Fowler-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Winter_bits-packed-inside-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_photo-Rupert-Fowler-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Winter_bits-packed-inside-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_photo-Rupert-Fowler-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Winter_bits-packed-inside-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, it uses slightly rare, but still standard mini 4mm tool bits. They are well-suited (again) for low-torque tightening, like your sensitive cockpit components. And still plenty strong. The smaller bit size also allowed Feedback to tuck 6 bits with 10 common functions securely into the knurled head of the tool so you wouldn’t worry about losing the less-common bits.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_laser-markings.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_laser-markings.webp\" alt=\"Feedback Sports compact, folding 2-8Nm Range Twist Torque Tool T-handle wrench, laser-etched markings\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_laser-markings.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_laser-markings-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_laser-markings-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_laser-markings-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_laser-markings-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_laser-markings-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, it uses a very basic, but still reasonably accurate torsion bar for metering-out the correct amount of torque. Just twist and line up the little laser-etched markings to hit the whole number torque setting you need. One downside of this torsion bar-style id that technically you shouldn’t ever use it to loosen bolts – a real drawback with its uncommon bits. But as long as you don’t loosen a bolt tightened to more than this tool’s 8Nm max, it shouldn’t affect accuracy. In any case, the laser-marked arrows make it easy to see that the tool is starting from zero in the first place, so that point should be moot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_open-contents.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_open-contents.webp\" alt=\"Feedback Sports compact, folding 2-8Nm Range Twist Torque Tool T-handle wrench, open contents\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_open-contents.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_open-contents-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_open-contents-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_open-contents-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_open-contents-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>fully CNC-machined aluminum construction, with magnetic bit holder</li>\n\n\n\n<li>folding T-handle design, with integrated bit storage inside</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2-8Nm torsion bar style torque wrench measurement</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1Nm increment torque markings – no pre-setting, just twist and go to the desired torque</li>\n\n\n\n<li>uses standard mini 4mm hex-shank tool bits (not conventional 1/4″ bits)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>10 S2 hardened steel tool bits are included, some of which are double-sided</li>\n\n\n\n<li>includes: 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5 &amp; 6mm hexes; T10 &amp; T25 torxes; and #2 Phillips &amp; 3.5mm flat head screwdrivers</li>\n\n\n\n<li>94g, claimed. 16.5mm x 127mm folded</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Feedback Range Twist Torque Tool – Pricing &amp; availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_closed.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_closed.webp\" alt=\"Feedback Sports compact, folding 2-8Nm Range Twist Torque Tool T-handle wrench, closed\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_closed.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_closed-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_closed-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_closed-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-Sports-compact-folding-2-8Nm-Range-Twist-Torque-Tool-T-handle-wrench_closed-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as it functionally fills the gap between the very basic $35 Reflex Fixed Torque Bit Driver kit, its separately available $25 Reflex Torque extensions, and the bigger shop-quality $120 Range Click Torque Wrench, this new folding home torque wrench slots in between price-wise, too. The new Feedback Range Twist Torque Tool sells for $75 / €85. That makes it a pretty affordable way to safeguard your fancy cockpit components.

I generally get the feeling that any new tire lever design is one too many. Meaning I’m reluctant to try switching to new levers when I already have ones that work. But the Feedback Biolevers have a nice trick up their sleeve in being made from a new bio-based nylon material.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The $6 pair of levers is molded out of a plastic that is actually created by processing plant sugars into 100% renewable carbon as the basis of the nylon, instead of starting with fossil fuels. Performance-wise, it’s just as tough as conventional plastic, but with fewer negative environmental impacts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-eco-friendly-Biolever-tire-levers-amde-of-plant-based-nylon.webp\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-eco-friendly-Biolever-tire-levers-amde-of-plant-based-nylon.webp\" alt=\"eco-friendly Feedback Biolevers, side profile\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-eco-friendly-Biolever-tire-levers-amde-of-plant-based-nylon.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-eco-friendly-Biolever-tire-levers-amde-of-plant-based-nylon-297x143.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-eco-friendly-Biolever-tire-levers-amde-of-plant-based-nylon-120x58.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Feedback-eco-friendly-Biolever-tire-levers-amde-of-plant-based-nylon-768x369.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Function-wise, I’ve been using the new 117mm/4.6″-long red and black levers for a few weeks. They work well prying tires on &amp; off, have a useful spoke hook opposite the thin bead hook, and snap-together for storage. Nothing fancy, just a couple of new tire levers that are slightly better for the planet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://feedbacksports.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FeedbackSports.com</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/feedback-range-twist-folds-t-handle-torque-wrench-into-your-palm-plus-new-biolevers/\">Feedback Range Twist Folds T-Handle Torque Wrench into Your Palm, Plus New BioLevers</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"6a9d5f0b4017b80dc9e14caee0cec34a3e76594397721635a0b748055d3bed7d","category":"Cycling"}
