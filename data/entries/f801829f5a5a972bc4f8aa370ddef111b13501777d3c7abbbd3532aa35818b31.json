Call it an all-rounder, S24O chariot, or a gravel bike. It fits big, fat tires, but it is not a mountain bike. It uses a 68 mm bottom bracket shell, is non-boost spaced, and made from an <em>ultralight tubeset</em>. It is a sportier version of the heavy-duty Evasion touring bike with 27.5″ wheels.</p>\n<p>It is designed around a 650b/ 27.5″ wheel with a 2.3″ max tire size. Think about it as a “plus” size tire gravel bike. Crust wanted to keep the tube set light to keep the ride quality opulent and snappy. It’s perfect for all forms of roads, but don’t go smashing down a rocky jeep trail on it. Enjoy the cushioned, billowy ride quality instead.</p>\n<p>New for 2025, the Crust Bombora comes with a new “matte clear” finish and the updated Crust cable guides.
