After the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1341179/apple-will-be-forced-to-switch-iphone-to-usb-c-by-2024.html\">European Parliament voted</a> back in 2022 for a new rule requiring all new phones and smaller electronics that use a cable to charge to be equipped with a USB-C port, the countdown to the death of Lightning began. While the rule technically only applies to new products sold in Europe, Apple has been changing its Lightning devices to USB-C following the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2247687/iphone-15-review.html\">iPhone 15</a> in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September, Apple swapped out the Lightning port on the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2463117/the-new-airpods-max-are-another-lazy-apple-update-no-one-wants.html\">AirPods Max</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2463401/airpods-4-with-anc-review.html\">AirPods 4</a> case, leaving just a handful of Lightning devices remaining. Here’s what’s left and how much longer they’ll be around:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone SE</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Last updated: <strong>March 2022 (</strong>3rd gen)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Next expected update: March 2025 (4th gen)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple updated the iPhone 15 with USB-C in 2023, but there are still two phones remaining that have a Lightning port: the iPhone 14 and the iPhone SE. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">The latest iPhone SE rumors</a> say Apple will be updating the current model in 2025 with a new iPhone 14-style design, Apple Intelligence support, and of course, a USB-C port. In fact, Apple may be launching an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2495679/why-iphone-se-plus-makes-more-sense-than-you-think.html\">iPhone SE Plus</a> as well that would likely replace the iPhone 14 and make the whole lineup Lightning-free.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-cases-bottom.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"AirPods Pro 2 Lighting and speaker\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-cases-bottom.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 5165w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-cases-bottom.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-cases-bottom.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-cases-bottom.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-cases-bottom.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-cases-bottom.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-cases-bottom.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-cases-bottom.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Both of Apple’s AirPods cases need a Lightning port to charge.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Magic Keyboard, Magic Trackpad, Magic Mouse</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Last updated: March 2022 (black)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Next expected update: October 2024</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple hasn’t changed much about its trio of Mac accessories in nearly a decade, but it does introduce new colors somewhat regularly. In 2021, all three accessories—Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Mouse—got new colors to match the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347534/24-inch-imac-review-apple-design-display-colors-storage-upgradability-price.html\">24-inch iMac</a>, while the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/352492/you-can-now-get-a-touch-id-magic-keyboard-for-your-m1-mac.html\">Magic Keyboard received a Touch ID sensor</a>. Then in 2022, Apple began offering black versions of the accessories alongside the Mac Studio and Studio Display. While we don’t expect Apple to surprise us with a Magic Mouse that charges properly (meaning you don’t have to flip it over to connect the charger), Apple is expected to update its Mac accessories in 2024 with USB-C when the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2204696/m3-mac-studio-design-processor-specs-price.html\">first models with the M4 chips</a> arrive.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/slide-06-apple-magic-mouse-2-100622394-gallery.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Magic Mouse 2 charging\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/slide-06-apple-magic-mouse-2-100622394-gallery.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2100w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/slide-06-apple-magic-mouse-2-100622394-gallery.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/slide-06-apple-magic-mouse-2-100622394-gallery.jpg?resize=768%2C514&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/slide-06-apple-magic-mouse-2-100622394-gallery.jpg?resize=1200%2C803&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/slide-06-apple-magic-mouse-2-100622394-gallery.jpg?resize=1536%2C1028&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/slide-06-apple-magic-mouse-2-100622394-gallery.jpg?resize=2048%2C1370&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/slide-06-apple-magic-mouse-2-100622394-gallery.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/slide-06-apple-magic-mouse-2-100622394-gallery.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"803\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Powerbeats Pro</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Last updated: June 2020 (new colors)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Next expected update: 2025</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While most of Apple’s Beats products use USB-C or micro-USB for charging, there is one—the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232756/powerbeats-pro-review-better-than-airpods-but-not-for-everybody.html\">PowerBeats Pro</a>—that still uses Lightning. After Apple discontinued PowerBeats in 2024, we had assumed that the PowerBeats Pro were just going to disappear forever. But in September 2024 <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/shoheiohtani/\">Beats and Shohei Ohtani</a> teased a new model with a streamlined design. Additionally, they may be able to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/powerbeats-pro-2-heart-rate/\">measure heart rate</a> during a workout.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"34a5262f603ca9eb5c9d573654584b584a6bc64f8da1160a0f300eed84fa76e2","category":"Apple"}
