The date was 5th June 1940 and the race’s 17th stage would be the <em>tappone</em> – the hardest day – a 110km odyssey over the Falzarego, Pordoi and Sella passes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On this dramatic day, the slopes of the Falzarego hosted a special moment of cycling history: the beginning of the fierce but respectful rivalry between Fausto Coppi and Gino Bartali.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/passo-sella-cycling\">Classic climb: Passo Sella, a fabled rock of the Giro d’Italia</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/passo-giau-cycling\">Classic climb: Passo Giau, a stunning climb in the Dolomites with an unrelenting gradient</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tre-cime-di-lavaredo-cycling\">Classic climb: Tre Cime di Lavaredo, a fearsome climb in the Dolomites that’s about more than just numbers</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>The Italians were teammates at Legnano, but Bartali was supposed to be the alpha.

But Bartali had been injured in a crash earlier in the race and by Stage 17 the young Coppi had surged far ahead, now boasting a 59-second lead over Enrico Mollo in second place. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/classic-climb-valparola-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Passos Falzarego and Valparola\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/classic-climb-valparola-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/classic-climb-valparola-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/classic-climb-valparola-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/classic-climb-valparola-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/classic-climb-valparola-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/classic-climb-valparola-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/classic-climb-valparola-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/classic-climb-valparola-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/classic-climb-valparola-02.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The tension was palpable but their team manager, Eberardo Pavesi, hoped to broker an accord.

On 10th June, the day after the final stage of the Giro, Benito Mussolini sent Italian soldiers into France. With the Giro suspended during the war, Coppi went to fight in Africa, while Bartali spent the war smuggling fake identity documents in his bike frame and helping to save the lives of many Jewish families.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Giro returned, the rivalry between the duo – now on separate teams – resumed, with the Falzarego again hosting several key battles. At the 1946 Giro, Coppi surged clear with a dramatic solo attack on the Falzarego, arriving at the barren summit alone, although Bartali went on to claim the overall win. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/classic-climb-valparola-05-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Passos Falzarego and Valparola\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/classic-climb-valparola-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/classic-climb-valparola-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/classic-climb-valparola-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/classic-climb-valparola-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/classic-climb-valparola-05-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/classic-climb-valparola-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/classic-climb-valparola-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/classic-climb-valparola-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/classic-climb-valparola-05.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The sweeping hairpins on the higher slopes of the Passo Falzarego.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The following year, Bartali dropped his chain on the Falzarego and Coppi attacked. Then on the descent, Coppi lost his own chain, which enabled Bartali to catch up. But Coppi escaped once more to surge to a stage win and later claim his second Giro. As a result of these tussles, the Falzarego is forever entwined with the Coppi-Bartali legend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Twin peaks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The name Falzarego stems from <em>falza rego</em> (false king) in Ladin, the regional dialect of Dolomite locals, and refers to the legend of a king who was turned to stone for betraying his people and remained forever petrified in the mountain walls.
