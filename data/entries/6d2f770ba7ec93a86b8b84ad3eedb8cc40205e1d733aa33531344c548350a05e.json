If you want to bag some nice pre-Christmas deals on cycling stuff head over to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-deals\" target=\"_blank\">our Black Friday guide</a> for our selection of the best stuff. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is In the Drops, we don’t deal in deals we deal in quality new things, and boy do I have a selection for you today. Before we get into it though, here’s your weekly reminder of all the fun things we published on cyclist.co.uk this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We kicked things off by revisiting our guide on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/how-to-keep-your-feet-warm-while-cycling-in-winter\" target=\"_blank\">how to keep your feet warm while riding outside in winter</a> followed by a late plug for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/leigh-timmis-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">our latest podcast episode</a> with the fastest person to cycle across Europe, Leigh Timmis. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our regular pro history feature took us back to 1963 for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tom-simpson-bordeaux-paris-1963\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Simpson’s Bordeaux-Paris victory</a> (before ‘ultracycling’ was cool it was just called ‘cycling’) and we updated our piece on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/bike-maintenance-what-to-check\" target=\"_blank\">five simple bike maintenance checks you should do right now</a>. I’ll pause here so you can read that and get them done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve sorted that, you can read Emma’s article on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/4-cycling-brands-embracing-a-greener-black-friday\" target=\"_blank\">the cycling brands embracing a greener Black Friday</a> (Green Friday anyone?).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also updated our guides to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-groupsets\" target=\"_blank\">road bike groupsets</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-aluminium-road-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">the best aluminium road bikes</a>, and met <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/repete-cycles\" target=\"_blank\">one of the men behind trendy custom bike builder Repete Cycles</a> – I’ve met them both, they’re lovely guys with <em>very </em>nice bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bianchi brought out a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/bianchi-impulso-gravel-bike\" target=\"_blank\">new racy gravel bike called the Impulso</a>, a fitting name for Black Friday, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/thibaut-pinot-groupama-fdj-auction\" target=\"_blank\">Groupama-FDJ put a load of bikes, memorabilia and experiences up for auction</a> including Thibaut Pinot’s final Tour de France bike, a big flag with his face on and dinner with Marc Madiot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally Emma debunked some of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/recovery-methods-myths\" target=\"_blank\">myths about recovery methods</a> and also tested out <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/muuvr-fitness-app\" target=\"_blank\">new fitness app Muuvr</a>, which rewards your exercise with credits to buy actual things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right, should we get onto some full priced (mostly)

Swedish brand refined the design and has now released the Win Wing 2: Electric Boogaloo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay so it’s just called Win Wing 2, but the changes introduced are worth shouting about. For now the update is just for the gravel Win Wings but a road update will be on sale soon with the same changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/win-wing-2-3-970x728.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/win-wing-2-3-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/win-wing-2-3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/win-wing-2-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/win-wing-2-3-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/win-wing-2-3-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/win-wing-2-3-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/win-wing-2-3-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Will Strickson</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most obviously from these pictures, an all black ‘Stealth’ option has been released, which was apparently the most common request Ass Savers received after the initial launch. This colour option is only limited edition, so be quick if you want one, but the black wishbone is now standard, taking over from the grey original design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s harder to see is that this new edition includes transparent frame protection stickers to put onto the seat stays before you attach the wishbone, to prevent it rubbing any paint off.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/win-wing-2-1-970x728.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/win-wing-2-1-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/win-wing-2-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/win-wing-2-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/win-wing-2-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/win-wing-2-1-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/win-wing-2-1-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/win-wing-2-1-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Will Strickson</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally the wishbone itself has been tweaked to make it even stronger and it is noticeably sturdier. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy it now from <a href=\"https://ass-savers.com/collections/win-wing/products/win-wing-2-gravel-stealth\" target=\"_blank\">Ass Savers (€27)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rapha Explore Pullover</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rapha-explore-pullover-1-970x728.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rapha-explore-pullover-1-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rapha-explore-pullover-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rapha-explore-pullover-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rapha-explore-pullover-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rapha-explore-pullover-1-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rapha-explore-pullover-1-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rapha-explore-pullover-1-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Will Strickson</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve have technical T-shirts knocking about for a while now, but what about when it gets cold? Let me present Rapha’s new technical jumper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Made to be a mid-layer one the bike but also suitably comfy off the bike, the Explore Pullover is a lightweight long-sleeve jumper mostly made from the Polartec Power Grid fleece fabric, which both insulates and helps wick sweat. It also features a water-repellent windblock fabric on the chest that helps while riding and acts like a bib when you’re eating so you can easily clean food and drink stains off. I’m sure that’s what Rapha intended it for, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rapha-explore-pullover-2-970x728.jpg\" width=\"970\" height=\"728\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rapha-explore-pullover-2-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rapha-explore-pullover-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rapha-explore-pullover-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rapha-explore-pullover-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rapha-explore-pullover-2-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rapha-explore-pullover-2-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rapha-explore-pullover-2-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>The Polartec fleece fabric is the highlight here</figcaption><figcaption>Will Strickson</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been wearing it to work the past few weeks over a technical T-shirt and was pleasantly surprised. It wasn’t too much under a waterproof jacket and on dry days was sufficient without a layer on top. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was initially unsure about wearing it off the bike but the fleece is really comfy and adds more warmth than you’d expect for such a thin fabric.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RRP: £110</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy it now from <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18515&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;clickref=in+the+drops+rapha+pullover&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fgb%2Fen%2Fshop%2Fmens-explore-pullover%2Fproduct%2FAGF01XXMTL\" target=\"_blank\">Rapha (£88)</a> – yes it’s already discounted!</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lead Out!

Well, have another look because every inch of that bad boy can be covered with a bag to make riding with extra bits and bobs easier. I personally hadn’t seen a rear top tube bag before and when Lead Out! presented me with this one I loved the idea of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attaching neatly to the seatpost and top tube with Hypalon-reinforced velcro straps, the Racelite Rear Top Tube Bag sits securely out the way of frame, front top tube and saddle bags while offering an extra storage solution, probably best for snacks, gels, spare electrolytes or small tool and such bits you’d slot into a small saddle bag. It’s not quite phone length, but you should have plenty of pocket or bag space for that by this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/lead-out-rear-top-tube-bag-1-970x512.jpg\" width=\"970\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/lead-out-rear-top-tube-bag-1-970x512.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/lead-out-rear-top-tube-bag-1-300x158.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/lead-out-rear-top-tube-bag-1-768x406.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/lead-out-rear-top-tube-bag-1-1536x811.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/lead-out-rear-top-tube-bag-1-2048x1082.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/lead-out-rear-top-tube-bag-1-750x396.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/lead-out-rear-top-tube-bag-1-1140x602.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Inside the bag there is a little elastic mesh separator.</figcaption><figcaption>Will Strickson</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s made with lightweight and water-resistent Dyneema and X-Pac – and has a handy cover over the top of the zip – to ensure safety in all conditions, and it’s a hard-shell design, so it stays upright and out of the way of your legs at all times.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RRP: £61</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy it now from <a href=\"https://leadoutgear.com/products/racelite-rear-top-tube-bag/\" target=\"_blank\">Lead Out!

It even uses eco dyes to get colour onto the clothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand has a minimal range but you wouldn’t need more, and that’s part of the point. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cadenzia-2-970x728.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cadenzia-2-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cadenzia-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cadenzia-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cadenzia-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cadenzia-2-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cadenzia-2-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cadenzia-2-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Will Strickson</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These winter bits Cadenzia has decked me out in include its bib tights, on which the main fabric is made from 86% recycled polyamide and the mesh of the straps is made from 95% recycled polyamide – the rest is elastane.

We even bumped into Jumbo-Visma on the Paterberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, it’s that time again, I’ve concocted another playlist of new music released since my last In the Drops and it’s bumper edition. As artists scramble to get their stuff out before Christmas there has been loads, and 47 songs have made it into this playlist, plus a couple released before that I’ve been banging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously it’s wall to wall bangers but some highlights include new ones from Yard Act, Bad Sounds, rainbow frog biscuits, Black Pumas, Moko, Majid Jordan, Mk.gee, The Last Dinner Party and a little known band called The Beatles. Stick it on shuffle and enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See you in the new year.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4nn8902rY51yAmHkLYMWUN\" target=\"_blank\">In the Drops #17 on Spotify</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/1151659770/playlists\" target=\"_blank\">all my In the Drops playlists</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/ass-savers-win-wing-2\">In the Drops: Win Wing 2, Rapha Pullover, Lead Out rear top tube bag, Cadenzia eco kit and Flanders</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Deputy Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"6d2f770ba7ec93a86b8b84ad3eedb8cc40205e1d733aa33531344c548350a05e","category":"Cycling"}
