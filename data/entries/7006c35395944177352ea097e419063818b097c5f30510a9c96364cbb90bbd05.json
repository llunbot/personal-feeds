The earbuds are listed with a May 18 release date and a $169.95 price.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/Beats-Studio-Buds-Plus-Transparent.jpeg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nNotably, the listing reveals that the Studio Buds+ will be available in a new transparent design option that looks fairly similar to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/22/nothing-launches-ear-2-wireless-earbuds/\">Nothing Ear (2) earbuds</a>. The earbuds will also be available in Black and Ivory, according to the listing. The overall design of the Studio Buds+ looks largely the same as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/25/beats-studio-buds-apple-store-pickup/\">original Studio Buds</a> released in 2021.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBeats Studio Buds+ remain a sportier alternative to the AirPods Pro, and have a more compact design without \"stems\" that drop below the ears.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith 3x larger microphones and air vent changes, the Studio Buds+ will feature up to 1.6× as much active noise cancellation and up to 2× improved Transparency mode as the original Studio Buds, according to the listing. They also provide longer battery life, with the Studio Buds+ advertised as offering up to 36 hours of listening time with the included USB-C charging case, compared to 24 hours for the original Studio Buds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nStudio Buds+ have IPX4-rated water resistance and will be available with XS, S, M, and L ear tip size options to fit a wider range of ears. The earbuds are compatible with both Apple and Android devices and offer features such as one-touch pairing, automatic switching between devices, Hey Siri support, and Find My support.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBeats Studio Buds+ were first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/21/beats-studio-buds-plus/\">discovered in iOS 16.4 code</a> last month, and the earbuds also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/apple-beats-studio-buds-plus-fcc/\">surfaced in FCC filings</a> last week. It's unclear when Apple plans to announce the earbuds, but it appears they will launch next month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tme_michael\">Michael Burkhardt</a>!)</em><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/\">Beats</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats-studio-buds/\">Beats Studio Buds</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/25/beats-studio-buds-plus-amazon-listing/\">Beats Studio Buds+ Launching in May With New Transparent Design Option, Improved Noise Cancellation, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beats-studio-buds-launching-in-may-with-new-transparent-design-option-improved-noise-cancellation-and-more.2387826/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7006c35395944177352ea097e419063818b097c5f30510a9c96364cbb90bbd05","category":"Apple"}
