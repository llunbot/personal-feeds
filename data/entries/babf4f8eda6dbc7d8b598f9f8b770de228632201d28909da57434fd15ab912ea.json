We welcome the opportunity to meet with Formula One Management and have written to them confirming our interest.\"</p>\n<p>F1 apparently never followed up with a phone call or even subsequent email during the six weeks between that initial invitation and its announcement at the end of January. Had the two parties gotten together, it's likely that Andretti could have cleared up some other things for F1 as well.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001040#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001040&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
