multi-day trips, <em>Road</em> for “same-day adventures”, and <em>Commuter</em> for everyday essentials. The idea is to make it easier for cyclists to find what they are looking for, but everything is still interchangeable as you pack for your own personalized bikepacking adventures.</p><p>Miss Grape Road packs Review: lightweight Italian bikepacking bags for faster adventure rides</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/04092341/Miss-Grape-Road-Collection-packs_lightweight-compact-made-in-Italy-bikepacking-bags-for-fast-gravel-and-road-bike-adventures.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/04092341/Miss-Grape-Road-Collection-packs_lightweight-compact-made-in-Italy-bikepacking-bags-for-fast-gravel-and-road-bike-adventures.jpg\" alt=\"Miss Grape Road Collection packs, light made-in Italy bikepacking bags for fast gravel &amp;

with R&amp;D on the lightweight lineup. In fact, we got a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/05/14/friday-roundup-wbr-pedal-to-empower-bike-league-bipoc-win-campy-bora-ultra-wto-wheels-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sneak peek at this Road setup</a> we are testing back in May on Sofiane’s bike, and have been teased that more light packs are in the development pipeline still.</p><p>This Road series are the first bags we’ve actually used from Miss Grape, but we’ve been <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=miss+grape\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spotting them on bikes</a> more or less since the brand was created back in 2014. While a number of bikepacking bag makers seem to focus on tons of technical details, the Miss Grape bags seem simple and straightforward, while still promising to be “indestructible”. And that also means they are relatively lightweight, although never really prioritizing being the lightest.</p><p><a

climbing out of the saddle. But at a max 20cm long and 8cm tall it might be a tight fit for riders looking to stick their larger phablet-sized phones inside. Still plenty of room for all-day ride snacks, a power bank, reasonably-sized mobile phones, and your wallet. It isn’t technically waterproof, but has kept our gear dry in light to medium rain.</p><p>Below it, the Internode 2 is a bit wider at 5cm, and grows out to a max 7cm width. We’ve still not had any real issue with hitting it when pedaling. But at just 2L, you do have to be conscious not to overstuff it. We like the smaller size though, as it doesn’t really interfere with bottles much at all. On a few medium &amp; large gravel bikes with slightly sloping geometry, we still had plenty of room for two full-size water bottles.</p><p><a

It compresses down quite well to around a minimum 2L of storage while still feeling secure (Miss Grape quotes that down to 1L which is probably a stretch). Or you can overfill it up to the max 7L while still being fully waterproof, plus a bit more in a pinch.</p><p>The quick-release buckles on the side green straps make it easy to install &amp; remove the bag, with locking cams so you can get it tight to not sway. And the rear green strap helps to really compress, cinch down, and secure whatever you have packed inside – much more securely and easier than typical drybag style roll-down closures alone.</p><h3>Tech details, waterproof vs. water-resistant &amp;

The Node Road also has generously long straps to secure it in place. We kept them full-length to swap from bike-to-bike, but suggest cutting them to length (just melt/fuse the ends to prevent fraying) for the perfect fit on your bike.</p><p>Our actual 133g waterproof Internode 2 frame bags was a tad lighter than claimed, and has Miss Grape’s signature one green strap &amp; one black strap around the downtube. Nothing fancy here, just one simple pocket and full protection from the weather.</p><h3>Miss Grape Road on gravel…</h3><p><a

Alongside the release of their latest Ekar 13-speed gravel groupset came a gravel softgoods line-up including a bunch of riding kit and these three new 100% made-in-Italy bags <a href=\"https://www.campagnolo.com/WW/en/store/cycling_accessories/gravel_bags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rebranded with Ekar logos</a> (and slightly higher price tags).</p><p>In fact, even though Campy didn’t push the Miss Grape connection, they even feature the standard Cluster/Internode/Node names and include tiny Miss Grape logo tags throughout. Everything made-in-Italy to match your Campagnolo Ekar gravel bike, and still backed by Miss Grape’s lifetime warranty.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://missgrape.net/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MissGrape.net</a></em></p></div></div>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b1a47f9a58efcebbb3a87fda90986ce101d0d8c61ea0c96bd0e0ad7c456f0d3e","category":"Cycling"}
