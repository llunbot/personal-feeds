The consumer price for the headset starts at $3,499 but can be as much as a thousand dollars more than that, depending on the configuration the buyer chooses.</p>\n<p>Vision Pro presents both the real and the virtual worlds to the user with two micro-OLED displays, one for each eye. Together, these dual displays are the most expensive component in the headset, costing $456. Another external display (the one used for EyeSight) costs around $70, Hsieh estimates. That means that Omdia estimates the device's displays account for about 35 percent of the total cost of the device's materials.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005985#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005985&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"71bcac479198257b886520ef03e6e2346feae0f318cf3e40c79a8bfa57383bb5","category":"Tech"}
