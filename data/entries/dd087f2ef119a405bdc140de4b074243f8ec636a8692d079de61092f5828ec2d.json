Since then, the days of sweet fixie bikes seem to have somehow gone by, I have grown older and even this bike has evolved to keep up with the changing times.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/6.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/6.jpg?w=2048&amp;quality=75 2048w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/6.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/6.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/6.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/6.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/6.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/6.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/6.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The bike is originally from the streets of Turku, a mythical island between Finland and the rest of the world where track bikes roam free. There the frame has also received a layer of olive drab paint and in a gloomy lair, a local artisan has prepared the frame for brakes of the future – cantilevers, the whole rim is the brake disc and braking doesn’t actually affect the speed.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/5.jpg?w=2048&amp;quality=75 2048w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/5.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/5.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/5.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/5.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/5.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/5.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/5.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I bought the frame already modified, in a rather hybrid-y single-speed guise. I had had this sweet Easton EC70 X fork and the blue Frogglegg cantilevers stashed away for a while waiting for the right frame, with some other bits and pieces from my parts stash, the Kona quickly transformed into the sort of fixed gear cyclocross it is now.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/8.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/8.jpg?w=2048&amp;quality=75 2048w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/8.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/8.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/8.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/8.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/8.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/8.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/8.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Rather than epic bikepacking voyages and thrilling fixed-gear cyclocross races, the bike mostly serves as my commuter in the slushy Hellsinki, often with a trailer in the back.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1704\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/EPSN1520-31-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/EPSN1520-31-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/EPSN1520-31-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/EPSN1520-31-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1332&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/EPSN1520-31-scaled.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/EPSN1520-31-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1198&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/EPSN1520-31-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,889&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/EPSN1520-31-scaled.jpg?resize=700,466&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/EPSN1520-31-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1023&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/EPSN1520-31-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1364&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>My plans for the bike include replacing the 18t cog with a 17t to go even more faster-er, putting on some lighter knobby tyres after the winter, and riding it. It’s a good bike and a lot of fun on the local bits of trail and gravel when taking the long way to work.</p>\n<p>Notable components if someone’s interested:</p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong><br />\nFrame: Kona Band Wagon 59 cm, repainted and modified with cantilever bosses<br />\nFork: Easton EC70 X, carbon fiber<br />\nBrakes: Frogglegg cantilevers<br />\nWheels &amp; tyres: Miche XPress, Continental 37-622 tyres<br />\nDrivetrain: FSA Gimondi chainset, Gebhardt 42t chainring, Surly 18t cog, KMC chain.<br />\nOthers: Selle Italia Flite saddle, FSA seatpost &amp; stem, Specialized handlebar</p>\n<p><em>For the camera geeks among the readership, pictures were taken, depending a bit on the final selection with a Fuji X-Pro 2 and the magical Kamlan 50 mm f/1.1, and an Epson R-D1s. Taking pictures (of bikes) has somehow turned into a similar hobby to building and occasionally even actually riding my bikes, but that’s maybe a topic for another time and place.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared here at The Radavist.
