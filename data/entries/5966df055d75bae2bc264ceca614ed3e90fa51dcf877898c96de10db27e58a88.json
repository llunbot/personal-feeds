The so-called “<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePad</a>” could still launch by the end of this year (if everything goes right with Apple’s new plan), but that’s not Apple’s priority anymore. An even more intriguing product is in the works and a new report claims Apple wants to ship it “as soon as possible.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-25/how-jony-ive-openai-deal-will-impact-apple-new-details-on-apple-s-ios-redesign-mb3lwu45\">Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman</a>, Apple has prioritized the development of a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2427662/apple-has-several-hundred-people-working-on-homepod-with-robotic-display.html\">smart home device with a display attached to a robotic arm</a>. Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2427662/apple-has-several-hundred-people-working-on-homepod-with-robotic-display.html\">reported</a> on the device last August, but Gurman’s most recent report adds a bit more context. The device, which will reportedly have “a unique AI personality,” has hit a development “snag,” which could mean Apple may decide to withhold some features for later versions in order to ship it quicker.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/lamp1.gif\" alt=\"Robot lamp Apple research\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>A demonstration of the robot that Apple Machine Learning Research has been working on.

It launched the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2410306/vision-pro-demo-spatial-visio-media-fitting-experience.html\">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset last February, but its high price and limited usefulness have hindered its growth. The home tabletop robot–code-named J595–could certainly be a bigger hit. Apple is already developing technology that would allow the device’s arm to move in a way similar to that of <a href=\"https://www.pixar.com/luxo-jr\">Luxo Jr.</a>, the mascot of Pixar Studios. At the beginning of this year, Apple Machine Learning Research posted a paper with videos demonstrating “expressive and functional movement” for such a device. The research (seen above) looks impressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the HomeHub set for later this year, it has been rumored to feature a small display panel, possibly 7 inches. Code-named J490, it could essentially be a HomePod with a larger display, with Siri playing a major role in its user interface. Similar to competing devices from Google and Amazon, it would provide Home controls for smart home devices such as lights and thermostats, and could also serve as a FaceTime station.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5966df055d75bae2bc264ceca614ed3e90fa51dcf877898c96de10db27e58a88","category":"Apple"}
