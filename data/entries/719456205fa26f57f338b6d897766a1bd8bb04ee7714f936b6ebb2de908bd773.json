Over the weekend, Valve took the \"hiding\" part out of that \"hiding-in-plain-sight\" test, launching <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/?curator_clanid=4777282\">a bare bones Steam page for <em>Deadlock</em></a>, the company's first attempt at developing a new gaming franchise since collectible card game <em>Artifact</em> <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/exclusive-valve-walks-us-through-artifacts-new-demo-leaves-us-wanting-more/\">launched in 2018</a> (and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/valve-scraps-revamped-artifact-dumps-free-unfinished-2-0-version-on-steam/\">fell apart in 2021</a>).</p>\n<p>The new page, which went up on Saturday, has precious little information about <em>Deadlock</em>, save for a description as \"a multiplayer game in early development\" and a 22-second trailer that essentially pans over a piece of concept art. Everything from the game's system requirements to the release date is still \"TBD,\" and players who are lucky enough to get \"friend invites via our playtesters\" are promised \"temporary art and experimental gameplay\" on the Steam page.</p>\n<p>Not that a Steam page is strictly needed for more info on <em>Deadlock</em> at this point. Since the first leaks months ago, the playtest has slowly expanded from hundreds of players to tens of thousands, including some who have <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24219016/valve-deadlock-hands-on-secret-new-game\">posted extensive impressions</a> of the game. Valve has also reportedly lifted rules regarding streaming for invited playtesters, leading to <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/deadlock-1\">a surge of players showing off live gameplay on Twitch</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045368#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045368&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"719456205fa26f57f338b6d897766a1bd8bb04ee7714f936b6ebb2de908bd773","category":"Tech"}
