And they are all laced by hand by Classified in The Netherlands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The road rims are now 3.5mm wider internally, but just 1.5mm externally to create a smoother transition to wider 28 or 30mm tires. Classified wind tunnel data confirms they are actually aerodynamically faster with 30mm road tires. Not even counting the reduced rolling resistance or improved comfort of the wider tire. Plus, the complete road wheelsets have the exact same claimed weight as the original generation, making them bolt quite light. (Although the weight excludes the Powershift hub. So you might need to add a few tens of grams in your mind to directly compare them to conventional wheelsets.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1350\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Classified-Wheels_wider-more-aero-road-and-gravel-Powershift-wheelsets_R36-rim-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Classified Wheels, wider more aero road and gravel Powershift wheelsets, R36 rim detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Classified-Wheels_wider-more-aero-road-and-gravel-Powershift-wheelsets_R36-rim-detail.jpg 1350w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Classified-Wheels_wider-more-aero-road-and-gravel-Powershift-wheelsets_R36-rim-detail-297x158.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Classified-Wheels_wider-more-aero-road-and-gravel-Powershift-wheelsets_R36-rim-detail-800x427.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Classified-Wheels_wider-more-aero-road-and-gravel-Powershift-wheelsets_R36-rim-detail-120x64.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Classified-Wheels_wider-more-aero-road-and-gravel-Powershift-wheelsets_R36-rim-detail-768x410.jpg 768w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new R36 (a mm deeper than the R35) is 36mm deep x 22.5mm internal and 28.5mm wide externally, at 1315g for the pair.

Plus, they also feature upgraded stiffness thanks to a new asymmetric rim profile. Classified says the 42mm deep hooked tubeless gravel rim itself weighs 415g, with a new 25mm internal width &amp; 30mm outside. Claimed weight is just 1350g, yet Classified rates them for everything from gravel racing to loaded bikepacking touring.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Classified R36, R50 &amp; G42 wheels – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Classified-Wheels_wider-more-aero-R36-R50-G42-gravel-and-road-wheelsets-for-Powershift-hubs_R36-rear-wheel.jpg\" alt=\"Classified Wheels, wider more aero R36, R50 &amp;

That complete Classified setup with these wheels will run you 2600€ in total. Which actually gives you a decent discount on the smart drivetrain bits vs. buying it separately and getting a wheelset from someone else. Really you only buy the 1500€ wheelset on its own, if you already have a Classified-equipped bike. And are looking to get a 2nd set of wheels for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the new R36 &amp; R50 road and G42 gravel wheels aren’t quite ready to order just yet. Officially they debut at the Velofollies consumer bike show in Belgium this weekend. So you’ll be able to order a set through Classified’s dealer network, starting next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.classified-cycling.cc/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Classified-cycling.cc</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/classified-revamps-wheels-with-wider-light-more-aero-road-gravel-wheelsets/\">Classified Revamps Wheels with Wider, Light, More Aero Road &amp; Gravel Wheelsets</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"f12f136ca994d37d68022051f1c5c0bb475f56633bac556eee2cb804f1fdfa87","category":"Cycling"}
