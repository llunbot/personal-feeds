And of course, they also have a stunning 14.2-inch or 16.2-inch ProMotion display, an excellent keyboard, and an array of ports, including three Thunderbolt ports, an SD card reader, and an upgraded HDMI 2.1 port for connecting higher-resolution displays. Also new this year are Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 so your machine will be as future-proof as it can get. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1480214/16-inch-macbook-pro-m2-pro-review.html\">our 4.5-star review</a> of the 16-inch M2 Pro MacBook Pro, we called it “an upgrade-worthy release” and concluded that “your money will absolutely be well spent.” And at this price, it’s even better.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"84dc87c1dffcb86bd2951fc8fb2d3a598355927a0a531e1026769daa1ea6b75f","category":"Apple"}
