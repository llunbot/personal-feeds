Whether in a busy cafe or on a noisy street, the ANC feature ensures a pure and uninterrupted audio experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Audio reproduction stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the best wireless Bluetooth headphones, and the active noise canceling is perhaps the best I’ve ever heard,” our expert said about the headphones and his experience with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there are times when ANC isn’t ideal and you have to be aware of your surroundings. For those instances, the AirPods Max have a convenient Transparency mode. This enables you to hear and interact with the world around you without needing to remove the headphones. It’s a safety feature you can rely on, especially when crossing the street. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With up to 20 hours of battery life, even with Active Noise Cancellation and Personalized Spatial Audio enabled, the AirPods Max are perfect for long listening sessions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, suppose you listen to music on your Apple device, and you’re looking for headphones that deliver the premium audio quality, advanced noise cancellation, and superior build quality. In that case, the AirPods Max are the perfect solution, especially now that they’re $100 off. </p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B08PZHYWJS?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Grab the Apple AirPods Max for $100 off at Amazon</a></p>\nHeadphones</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c94c779995fc35b5d3ea8131e5f1fbc68a3d3360bf090ffa0050f1aeb7c5184b","category":"Apple"}
