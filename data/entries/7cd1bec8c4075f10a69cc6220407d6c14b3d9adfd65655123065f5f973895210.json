Lately, there has been a lot of discussion of a 'lunar economy' in spaceflight but precious little clarity on what that means. Most firms that have announced business plans to launch rockets to the Moon, land on the Moon, or perform other activities there have been doing so with the intent of selling services or lunar water to NASA or other parties fulfilling government contracts. Put another way, there has been no wealth creation, and ultimately, NASA is the customer.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009780#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009780&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7cd1bec8c4075f10a69cc6220407d6c14b3d9adfd65655123065f5f973895210","category":"Tech"}
