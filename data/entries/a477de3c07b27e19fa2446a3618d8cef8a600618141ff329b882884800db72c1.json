Cresting a hill topped with a small chapel, her town spreads out below—in the bay, gently rocking fishing boats; onshore, the Linwood Bar &amp; Grill, the Crab Pot Grocery, and a couple dozen homes on stilts.</p>\r\n<p>Geagel, Seldovia’s city manager, turns around to three people sitting in the back seat, who partner with the United States’ <a href=\"https://nws.weather.gov/nthmp/\">National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program</a> and have traveled in from Anchorage and Fairbanks for a meeting with community leaders about tsunami hazards. She points out how much of the landscape could be underwater if one of the giant, fast-moving waves were to hit: “Pretty much the entire map of Seldovia is in the inundation zone, except for this hill.”</p>\r\n<p>Alaska is uniquely vulnerable to two types of tsunamis. The first, tectonic tsunamis, are linked to the long string of volcanic islands that curves like a tail from the state’s southern tip; these islands mark the northern edge of the Ring of Fire, a geologically active zone that generates approximately 90 percent of the world’s earthquakes. Tracing those islands, deep under water, is the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone, a trench where vast plates of hard rock overlap and friction slowly builds. Once or twice a year, the subduction zone generates <a href=\"https://undark.org/2016/08/09/bracing-big-one-oregons-coast-earthquake/\">earthquakes</a> strong enough to trigger tsunami alerts; every 300 to 600 years or so, it ruptures in a megaquake that sends devastating tectonic tsunamis to Alaska’s shores.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986389#p3\">Read 43 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986389&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Undark Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a477de3c07b27e19fa2446a3618d8cef8a600618141ff329b882884800db72c1","category":"Tech"}
