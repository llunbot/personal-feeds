{"title":"Updated MacOS 12 Monterey Page Reveals Safari 15 With Tabs That Look Like Tabs","link":"https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey/","date":1634581455000,"content":"\n<p>Didn’t make today’s event, for some reason, but the updated page for MacOS 12 Monterey (shipping next Monday) <a href=\"/misc/2021/10/safari-15-fixed-tabs.jpeg\">shows</a> that Safari 15 has reverted to actual tabs instead of “tabs”. Compact mode is still an option, which is great — the way this design should have been approached all along. Safari 15 on iPadOS 15.1 comes along for the ride too.</p>\n\n<p>We’re left with one single design mistake in Safari 15 across all platforms: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1417151452452200454\">the close buttons for tabs being on the right instead of the left on iPhone</a>. Pretty good outcome given what was shown back at WWDC.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/18/safari-15-tabs\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7748f03ed4bcfec18ec5c540a93e1d5877e254d9e8c58a411c70db89eb543d21","category":"Tech"}
