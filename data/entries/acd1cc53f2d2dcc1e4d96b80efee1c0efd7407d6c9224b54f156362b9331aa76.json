He also expects the device to have a titanium-aluminum frame, but with a lower percentage of titanium than used for iPhone 15 Pro models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe analyst added that while there will not be an iPhone 17 Plus, the new ultra-thin model will not be a replacement for it. Instead, he said the device will be an all-new model, with its main selling point to be its \"new design\" rather than specs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith no A19 Pro chip, a single camera, a slightly smaller display than the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and a focus on design over specifications, it sounds like the ultra-thin model will not be the so-called highest-end \"iPhone 17 Ultra\" after all. It is now unclear exactly where the device will be positioned in the iPhone 17 lineup, but that will likely become clearer as it gets closer to launching. Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 17 series in September 2025, so there is still a lot of runway for more rumors.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/\">Kuo: Ultra-Thin iPhone 17 to Feature A19 Chip, Single Rear Camera, Semi-Titanium Frame, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-to-feature-a19-chip-single-rear-camera-semi-titanium-frame-and-more.2432134/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"acd1cc53f2d2dcc1e4d96b80efee1c0efd7407d6c9224b54f156362b9331aa76","category":"Apple"}
