A registered developer account is required.\r<br />\n\r<br />\ntvOS updates don't typically garner as much attention as updates to iOS and macOS, and are never as feature rich, but tvOS 17 brings <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> to the TV for the first time. The ‌Apple TV‌ 4K can connect to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> that serves as the camera, with the ‌FaceTime‌ interface showing up on the TV's screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll of the ‌FaceTime‌ features are available, including Center Stage to keep you front and center, plus there are new gesture-based reactions that let you use your hands to generate on-screen effects. For example, if you make a heart with your hands, the screen will display hearts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSplit View for ‌Apple TV‌ lets users watch television with friends and family using SharePlay, and there are controls for transferring calls between the TV and an ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌ as needed. Third-party apps like Zoom will also be able to take advantage of this functionality, so those apps will also work on the TV screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nControl Center on ‌Apple TV‌ has been revamped and it is easier for users to access key settings and information, plus there is a new feature that allows the ‌iPhone‌ to locate a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> Remote that's been misplaced.\r<br />\n\r<br />\ntvOS also features a range of new aerial screen savers, adds support for third-party VPN apps, introduces Dolby Vision 8.1 on compatible devices, and more.
