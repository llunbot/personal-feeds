{"title":"MacRumors Giveaway: Win an iPhone 13 Pro or Pro Max From iMazing","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/17/macrumors-giveaway-iphone-13-pro-imazing/","date":1631901940000,"content":"For this week's giveaway, we've <a href=\"https://imazing.com/macrumors\">teamed up with iMazing</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an iPhone 13 Pro or iPhone 13 Pro Max with up to 1TB of storage and a copy of the <a href=\"https://imazing.com/macrumors\">iMazing software</a>, which is ideal for iPhone backups and management.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/imazing-header-purple.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you're unfamiliar with iMazing, it's Mac and Windows software that provides a range of handy tools for iOS device management, and it offers more versatility than Apple's Finder-based iPhone management system on the Mac and iTunes on Windows.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/imazing-main-view-background.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\niMazing allows for hassle-free Time Machine-like <a href=\"https://imazing.com/backup-iphone-ipad\">wireless backups</a> with multiple backup versions available. With iCloud and Apple's Mac/Windows backup tools older backups are overwritten rather than being saved, making it more difficult to get to the backup that you might prefer. With iMazing, you can also do your backups on a set schedule so you never forget to save your data.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/backups-list-background.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can browse through all of your backup snapshots to see your saved data, with backups able to be saved for weeks, months, and longer. Backups can also be encrypted for privacy, and iMazing backups are useful for <a href=\"https://imazing.com/transfer-all-data-to-any-other-iphone-or-ipad\">device-to-device transfers</a> like when you upgrade your iPhone.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf you need to <a href=\"https://imazing.com/iphone-photos-transfer\">transfer photos</a> from an iOS device to a Mac, there's a simple drag and drop option that lets you move your images from one device to another. You can keep what you need and delete what you don't want, and iMazing is able to load HEIF, RAW, and PNG, and JPG files so you can see what's what. There's also a built-in EXIF viewer that provides information on file type, size, and location.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/imazing-photos-monaco-background.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\niMazing is also useful for saving backups of your iMessages or your WhatsApp messages. You can save all of the <a href=\"https://imazing.com/transfer-iphone-text-messages-to-computer\">content of your messages</a>, like photos, videos, contacts, and links, and export that content later if it's needed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/imazing-messages-background.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nFor those who download their own music, iMazing can be <a href=\"https://imazing.com/iphone-music-transfer\">used to transfer songs</a> from an iOS device to a computer and vice versa. This can be particularly handy if you have an old iPhone or iPod and no other way to get the music off of it. Data remains local, with nothing uploaded to the cloud when you're working with iMazing.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf you want to see what makes iOS tick, you can also dig into system files, find logs, access a real-time device console, and check device diagnostics, including information on the iPhone's battery. Configuration and supervision tools are available for small businesses, making it easier for them to manage multiple devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApp management features are helpful for those who miss the app access that iTunes used to provide on the Mac. iMazing supports bulk deleting apps, backing up and restoring app data, and downloading apps to the iMazing app library so they can be reinstalled if an app is deleted from the App Store.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/imazing-transfer-background.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\niMazing gets regular updates, and some of the newest features include spyware detection and a podcast management feature. iMazing is compatible with iOS 15 and the upcoming macOS Monterey update.
