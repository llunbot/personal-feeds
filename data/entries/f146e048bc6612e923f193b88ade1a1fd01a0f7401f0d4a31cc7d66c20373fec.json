It's the most fun I've had in this particular obsession since <em>Monster Train</em>. <em>Cobalt Core</em> stretches into other genres, like perfect-knowledge turn-based tactics and space battle, but it's cards and randomness down to its electric-blue center.</p>\n<div><div></div><p>Launch trailer for <em>Cobalt Core</em>. </p></div>\n<p>A few years ago, I didn't know what a \"roguelike deck-builder\" was or what either of those compound phrases meant.

That 2019 game refined the fusion of two game mechanics: constant failure against randomized encounters <em>(a</em> <em>la </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)\"><em>Rogue</em></a>, but with a \"lite\" gradual progression) and the refining of a deck of combat-minded cards (as in <em>Magic: The Gathering, Dominion, </em>and <em>Netrunner</em>).
