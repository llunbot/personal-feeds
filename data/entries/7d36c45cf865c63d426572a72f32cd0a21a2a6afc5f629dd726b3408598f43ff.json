That’s when they <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hollywood-bike-racks-celebrates-50-years/\" target=\"_blank\">celebrated 50 years</a> in the industry. Now, they’ve launched their new hitch-mounted <a href=\"https://hollywoodracks.com/pages/meetthecrosstrack\" target=\"_blank\">CrossTrack Bike Rack</a>. The rack is available for <a href=\"https://hollywoodracks.com/products/crosstrack-1-bike\" target=\"_blank\">one</a> or <a href=\"https://hollywoodracks.com/products/crosstrack-2-bike\" target=\"_blank\">two</a> bikes and 1.25″ and 2″ receivers.

It’s a testament to the research, development, and testing that went into creating a product like this while keeping our promise of simple, strong, and secure.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hollywood-Racks-CrossTrack-Rack-road-bike-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hollywood-Racks-CrossTrack-Rack-road-bike-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Hollywood Racks CrossTrack Rack road bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hollywood-Racks-CrossTrack-Rack-road-bike-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hollywood-Racks-CrossTrack-Rack-road-bike-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hollywood-Racks-CrossTrack-Rack-road-bike-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hollywood-Racks-CrossTrack-Rack-road-bike-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hollywood-Racks-CrossTrack-Rack-road-bike-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hollywood-Racks-CrossTrack-Rack-road-bike-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The CrossTrack can handle many bike types, whether road, gravel, or mountain bikes. It can accommodate tires up to 4″ wide and a max wheelbase of 52″. The weight limit is 66 lbs per tray, so some of the heaviest eBikes may not play well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rack is designed to minimize bike-to-bike interference when the bikes are in the trays. It appears to accomplish this with front tire wheel stops that better stagger the bikes and provide excellent front wheel stability. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1_Bike_Rack_for_Car-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"540\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1_Bike_Rack_for_Car-jpg.webp\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1_Bike_Rack_for_Car-jpg.webp 540w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1_Bike_Rack_for_Car-240x300.webp 240w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1_Bike_Rack_for_Car-96x120.webp 96w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like some other of these types of racks, there is a push button to release the arms that usually has to be held down as you’re moving the arm back. Then you can ratchet it closed without touching the button. There’s also a front handle pull mechanism in the middle to tilt the rack up or down. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a
