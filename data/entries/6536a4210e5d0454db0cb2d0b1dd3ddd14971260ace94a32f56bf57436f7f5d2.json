She hated Puma so much she would go ballistic, barking and growling. Merely whispering the name “Puma” set off the same reaction, as though the sound of it and the idea of the dog it represented were clearly connected deep in Needle’s mind.</p>\n<p>A connection between a word and a mental representation of its meaning is called “referential understanding,” and for a very long time, we believed dogs lacked this ability. Now, a study published by a team of Hungarian researchers indicates we might have been wrong.</p>\n<h2>Practice makes perfect</h2>\n<p>The idea that dogs couldn’t form associations with language in a referential manner grew out of behavioral studies in which dogs were asked to do a selective fetching task. The canines had a few objects placed in front of them (like a toy or a bone) and then had to fetch the one specifically named by their owner.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012123#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012123&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jacek Krywko","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6536a4210e5d0454db0cb2d0b1dd3ddd14971260ace94a32f56bf57436f7f5d2","category":"Tech"}
