Every so often, we mark the public end of a once-essential wavelength, such as <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/plan-ahead-phase-out-3g-cellular-networks-and-service\">3G cellular</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/06/a-year-of-digital-tv-who-won-the-transition/\">analog television</a>, or the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/canadas-84-year-radio-time-check-has-stopped-because-of-accuracy-concerns/\">Canadian time check</a>. One of the most weirdly useful signals will soon end in the United Kingdom, with notable consequences if its transition is not properly handled.</p>\n<p>Beginning in the early 1980s, UK homes could have electrical meters installed with a radio teleswitch attached. These switches listened for a 198 kHz signal from the BBC's Radio 4 Long Wave service, primarily broadcast from the powerful Droitwich Transmitting Station. These switches listened to 30 messages per minute, waiting for a certain 50-bit data packet to arrive that signaled that electricity was now at cheaper, off-peak rates (\"tariffs\" in the UK).</p>\n<p>With this over-the-air notice, homes that bought into Economy 7 or Economy 10 (7 or 10 hours of reduced-price power) could make use of ceramic-stuffed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_heater\">storage heaters</a> that stayed warm into the day, prepare hot water heaters, and otherwise make use of off-peak power. How the electrical companies, BBC, and meters worked together is fascinating in its own right and documented in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEjDdtCRNlQ\">a recent video by Ringway Manchester</a> (which we <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2025/04/10/farewell-economy-7-a-casualty-of-the-long-wave-switch-off/\">first saw at Hackaday</a>).</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/powerful-programming-bbc-controlled-electric-meters-are-coming-to-an-end/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/powerful-programming-bbc-controlled-electric-meters-are-coming-to-an-end/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d9846f1f02b4ad09f37f3ed90e990451879e4d8f494a5c8729b8ec4c7e4ac40f","category":"Tech"}
