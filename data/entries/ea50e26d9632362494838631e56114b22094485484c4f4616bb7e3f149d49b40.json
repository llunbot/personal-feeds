This improves responsiveness and scalability, especially for scenarios where immediate responses are not required or where long-running tasks need to be offloaded.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/09/amazon-keyspaces-apache-cassandra-column-multi-region-tables/\"><strong>Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) now supports add-column for multi-Region tables</strong></a> – With this launch, you can modify the schema of your existing multi-Region tables in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/\">Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra)</a> to add new columns. You only have to modify the schema in one of its replica Regions and Keyspaces will replicate the new schema to the other Regions where the table exists.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/09/amazon-corretto-23-generally-available/\"><strong>Amazon Corretto 23 is now generally available</strong></a> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/\">Amazon Corretto</a> is a no-cost, multi-platform, production-ready distribution of OpenJDK.
