But he often said\nthat he would have loved to have been a teacher — and he was an\nextraordinarily generous one to generations of young composers.</p>\n\n<p>I was one of them. I came to New York right after college, full of\nambition to write Broadway musicals. Somehow I met Sondheim, and\nfor many years, he’d give me feedback on my songs, and I gave him\ncomputer lessons.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, he always said, <em>content dictates form</em>. In other\nwords, the <em>kind</em> of music you’re writing should depend on the\ncharacter and the dramatic situation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/12/01/pogue-sondheim\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"cfad2e238ec0e75ec11f43aaf66ab91aebeb9bf3e979f147159bec037416aea6","category":"Tech"}
