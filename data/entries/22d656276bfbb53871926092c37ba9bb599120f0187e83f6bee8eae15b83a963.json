A disc brake win</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Andrew Feather's hill climb bike 2\" title=\"Andrew Feather's hill climb bike 2\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> For the first time ever, a disc brake-equipped bike has won a UK Hill Climb National Championship.</span></figcaption><span> <i>BikeRadar / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The UK hill climb scene is usually a safe space for rim brakes, but that might be about to change.</p>\n<p>Andrew Feather became the first rider to win the UK National Hill Climb Championships on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">disc brakes</a>. Runner-up Ed Laverack was also on disc brakes, as he was last year.</p>\n<p>Feather’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-cannondale-supersix-evo/\">Cannondale SuperSix EVO Lab71</a> rolled on Hunt Hill Climb SL Disc Tubular wheels but still weighed less than 6kg.</p>\n<p>As the four-time national champion told Liam Cahill in a BikeRadar YouTube video, to harness the latest technology he had to switch to discs, even if it meant an additional 200g to 300g.</p>\n<p>So we should expect disc brakes to become more popular, at least among the elite hill climbers, to the dismay of rim-brake devotees.</p>\n\n<h2>  2.

Even mid-range options had frameset weights that would trouble the best top-end disc brake bikes today.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ben Mackinson's Trek Emonda SLR\" title=\"Ben Mackinson's Trek Emonda SLR\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You can easily fit lighter, third-party brakes to earlier Emonda frames.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Both use standard 1 ⅛in round steerer tubes, which opens up the compatibility of cockpit parts greatly.</p>\n<p>Until 2017, both also used standard-mount rim brakes (as opposed to direct-mount brakes). This more widely compatible system makes it easier for the owners to find svelter, aftermarket stoppers to drop even more weight from their bikes.</p>\n<p>The second-hand market is also awash with affordable bikes cast aside by once-adoring owners tempted away by modern aero fancies.</p>\n<p>In short, if you’re looking to build a lightweight hill climb bike, an Emonda or SuperSix is a great place to start.</p>\n<h2>  3.
