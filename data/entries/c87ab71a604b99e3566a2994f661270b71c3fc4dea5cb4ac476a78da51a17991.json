{"title":"Shawn King: ‘Be Wary of the “iPhone Photography Awards”’","link":"https://www.loopinsight.com/2020/07/22/be-wary-of-the-iphone-photography-awards/","date":1627827651000,"content":"\n<p>Shawn King, writing for The Loop regarding <em>last year’s</em> iPhone Photography Awards:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But I remember having my spidey senses tingle last year with these\nawards so I did some digging into it. The first thing I noticed\nwas you have to “pay to play” — that is, it costs $5.50 to submit\na single image with “discounts” given for multiple image\nsubmissions. Paying to submit images to a contest is not\nnecessarily a bad thing but it always raises concerns for me.</p>\n\n<p>Next up was the judges — or lack thereof. In an <a href=\"https://www.inputmag.com/culture/2020-iphone-photography-awards-winning-photos-heres-how-they-were-shot-judged\">interview\nwith Input</a>, the founder of the IPPAWARDS Kenan Aktulun\n(whose <a href=\"https://twitter.com/keakt\">Twitter account</a> is protected) wouldn’t say who the\njudges were:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I asked Aktulun to share some details behind the curtains about\nthe judging process. Though he wouldn’t say specifically who the\npanel of judges was for the 2020 winners, he said they were made\nup of a diverse cast of visual storytellers including\nphotographers and designers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s always a red flag for me. Every reputable photo\ncompetition, from Apple on down, lists the names of the people\ndoing the judging.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The prizes are sort of shitty too.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/01/king-ippawards\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c87ab71a604b99e3566a2994f661270b71c3fc4dea5cb4ac476a78da51a17991","category":"Tech"}
