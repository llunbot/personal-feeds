It’s about as versatile as bikes get thanks to rack mounts, mudguard fittings and bosses galore.</p>\n<p>The bike we tested didn’t stray far from Ribble’s off-the-peg configuration and featured Shimano’s Tiagra groupset, Tektro mechanical disc brakes and Mavic Aksium Disc Clincher wheels.</p>\n<p>Riders looking for a different spec can toy with Ribble’s BikeBuilder service, which allows individual component upgrades, from groupsets and wheels right the way through to different handlebars. Similarly, those who seek a more individual look can opt for Ribble’s custom colour option.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/ribble-cgr-725-steel-review/\">Read our full Ribble CGR 725 Steel </a><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/ribble-cgr-725-steel-review/\">review </a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Vitus Substance VRS-1 HT Apex</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Substance VRS-1 HT Apex has a front suspension fork.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£1,999 / $2,800 / €2,700 / AU$3,800 as tested</li>\n<li>Comfortable fit</li>\n<li>RockShox Rudy suspension fork, but entry-level drivetrain</li>\n</ul><p>There is a dizzying number of bikes in the Vitus Substance range, priced from £750 up to £2,500.</p>\n<p>This Substance VRS-1 HT Apex is one of the higher-specced models and it’s the priciest of the aluminium builds.</p>\n<p>The bike has a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/rockshox-rudy-ultimate-xplr-fork-review/\">RockShox Rudy XPLR fork</a> offering 30mm travel, and this proved impressive, working in tandem with 47mm tyres to smooth out the ride.</p>\n<p>Vitus has also specced a dropper post. The dropper was difficult to set up and our tester would forgo it to reduce weight and maintenance.</p>\n<p>This fancy tech comes with compromises elsewhere. Vitus has specced the bike with SRAM Apex, whereas other brands may use the pricier – and lighter –SRAM Rival at this price point.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the Vitus Substance VRS-1 HT is really fun to ride and if you enjoy technical riding the Rudy fork may be worth the weight penalty.</p>\n<p>The SRAM Rival-equipped version of this bike, for £500 more, could prove a wise upgrade if your budget allows it.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/vitus-substance-vrs-1-ht-apex-review/\">Read our full Vitus Substance VRS-1 HT Apex review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n\n<hr /><h2>Also consider…</h2>\n<p>This gravel bike scored fewer than four stars in testing, but is still a compelling option to consider.</p>\n<h3>BiviBikes Graveller</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>3.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The BiviBikes Graveller is a good all-rounder.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£1,499 as tested</li>\n<li>Great frame quality</li>\n<li>One size fits all</li>\n</ul><p>The Graveller is BiviBikes founder Fraser Barsby’s vision of the perfect adventure bike.</p>\n<p>It uses skinny steel tubes and smart welds to create a wonderful frameset with all the fixtures and fittings you need for big adventures.</p>\n<p>The bike is easy to control and the low gear range guarantees easy climbing.
