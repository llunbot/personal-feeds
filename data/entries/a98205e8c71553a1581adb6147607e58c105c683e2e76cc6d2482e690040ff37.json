{"title":"Elon Musk, Weirdo Extraordinaire","link":"https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/01/elon-musk-new-baby-14th-child-shivon-zilis/","date":1740955788000,"content":"\n<p>TMZ:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Seems Elon Musk is truly going to colonize Mars ... even if he has to do it himself, ’cause the tech mogul just welcomed his 14 child! Elon helped break the news Friday along with Shivon Zilis, with whom the billionaire already had three children.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You know what you call a man who has 14 children with four different mothers and has little interest or involvement in most of their lives? You call him a weirdo. This isn’t some quirk or fluke. He’s obviously some sort of eugenics freak who isn’t interested in family or fatherhood, but in spreading his seed like he’s some sort of prized racehorse. How is this any different than polygamy or assembling some sort of harem, other than that polygamists might live with and take an active role in raising their various children?</p>\n\n<p>Think too about how conservative news outlets would portray any woman who had children with four different fathers (and counting). Or if Musk were a black man working for a Democratic president. (Imagine the Fox News take if Barack Obama had five children from three different mothers, like Donald Trump does.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/02/musk-14\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a98205e8c71553a1581adb6147607e58c105c683e2e76cc6d2482e690040ff37","category":"Tech"}
