[credit:\n                              OnePlus                            ]\n                      </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n<p>OnePlus previously announced the OnePlus 12 flagship smartphone <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/the-oneplus-12-packs-a-5400-mah-battery-up-to-24gb-of-ram/\">in December</a>, but now it's getting a US release and pricing. The phone ships on February 6 in the US and Canada with a $800 price tag. OnePlus is also bringing the rather interesting OnePlus 12R to the US, a 6.8-inch device running last year's flagship Qualcomm chip, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, for $500.</p>\n<p>$800 is a pretty good price for a flagship phone. Samsung's 6.8-inch flagship is the $1,300 Galaxy S24. The Pixel 8 Pro is a $1,000, so OnePlus is undercutting the competition quite a bit. As we said, this device was already announced in December, but the highlights are an impressive 5400 mAh battery and super fast charging. The phone has 80 W proprietary wired charging in the US and 100 W internationally, while wireless charging is 50 W. OnePlus says 80 W is still fast enough to go from 1 percent to 100 percent in 30 minutes. OnePlus only promises an IP65 dust and water resistance rating, so it's not submergible, which is worse than most flagships. Other than that, it's a lot of normal flagship things: a 6.82-inch, 3168×1440 120 Hz OLED that—unlike Samsung and Google—is still curved, a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and too many cameras.</p>\n<p>The 24GB of RAM/1TB of storage spec apparently isn't coming to the US—the $800 model is 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and there's a single higher tier of 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $900. The white color is also not arriving here. You get black for $800, with the $900 model arriving in black or green.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998304#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998304&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"467113a2f45c5887068eef7ff40d66bc31d281bcadcd2cda526ef9233aa196e8","category":"Tech"}
