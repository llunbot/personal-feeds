For nearly four months, NASA knew Voyager 1 was still alive—it continued to broadcast a steady signal—but could not decipher anything it was saying.</p>\n<p>Confirming their hypothesis, engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California confirmed a small portion of corrupted memory caused the problem. The faulty memory bank is located in Voyager 1's Flight Data System (FDS), one of three computers on the spacecraft. The FDS operates alongside a command-and-control central computer and another device overseeing attitude control and pointing.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015200#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015200&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"47ae79bd0a1c712597a8360a03debdea603478be732f9f4fee3d691c6f0ed006","category":"Tech"}
