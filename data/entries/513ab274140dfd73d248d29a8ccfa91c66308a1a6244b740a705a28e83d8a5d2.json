There were no passengers aboard for that mission, and the capsule safely separated from the failed booster and parachuted to a controlled landing.</p>\n<p>The flight on Tuesday also didn't carry people. Instead, Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos's space company, lofted 33 payloads from NASA, research institutions, and commercial companies. Some of these payloads were flown again on Tuesday's launch after failing to reach space on the failed New Shepard mission last year. Among these payloads were an experiment to demonstrate hydrogen fuel cell technology in microgravity and an investigation studying the strength of planetary soils under different gravity conditions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991878#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991878&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"513ab274140dfd73d248d29a8ccfa91c66308a1a6244b740a705a28e83d8a5d2","category":"Tech"}
