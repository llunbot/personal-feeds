However, at this early stage, you should regard <em>all</em> such iPhone 14 rumor reports with extreme skepticism, regardless of the source. Apple tests many new technologies, but whether they make it into the iPhone or not has to do with a complicated web of technical feasibility, cost, availability of parts from suppliers, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, <em>Apple itself</em> probably will not have truly nailed down the iPhone 14’s specs until the first half of 2022. Some assumptions are safer than others (it will almost certainly have an A16 processor manufactured by TSMC), but chasing down rumors at this early stage is more of an exercise in entertainment than reliable information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all of those caveats out of the way, here’s what we’ve heard so far about the iPhone 14.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 14: The latest rumors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>November 3:</strong> <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-and-its-favorite-chipmaker-get-closer&amp;xcust=1-1-352696-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">The Information</a> reports that the iPhone 14’s <strong>A16 processor is facing production issues</strong> with its “cutting-edge manufacturing technique.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>October 8:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/542022/iphone-14-rumors-notch-hole-punch-display.html\">Jon Prosser reports</a> that while <strong>the notch</strong> might be gone in the Pro models, it <strong>will remain on the non-Pro models</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>September 28:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/538815/if-the-iphone-13-didnt-convince-you-to-upgrade-the-iphone-14-almost-certainly-will.html\">Mark Gurman of Bloomberg</a> reports that the iPhone 14 will be <strong>“a complete redesign”</strong> with <strong>new entry-level and Pro models</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>September 20: </strong>Ming-Chi Kuo has <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/358383/rumor-points-to-notchless-iphone-14-pro-affordable-iphone-14-max.html\">corroborated some rumors</a> we’ve heard about the iPhone 14, including <strong>a hole-punch display and 48MP camera</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure><h2>iPhone 14: Sizes, design, and display</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 12 comes in four sizes. There are two “regular” iPhone 12 models: a 6.1-inch and a 5.4-inch mini. And there are two Pro models: A 6.1-inch and a 6.7-inch Max model. We expect the same of the iPhone 13.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the iPhone 14 is rumored to drop the mini model in favor of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349476/iphone-14-in-display-touch-id-fingerprint-48mp-wide-angle-camera-max-6-7-inch-price.html\">a less-expensive Max model</a>. So we’ll get two 6.1-inch iPhones (regular and Pro) and two 6.7-inch Max iPhones (regular and Pro). This will be good news for those who want the larger Max size but wince at the $1,100 starting price. It also could come in a new titanium finish rather than stainless steel, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/26/iphone-14-2022-pro-models-titanium-case/&amp;xcust=1-1-352696-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">according to rumors</a>. And the volume buttons could return to the round shape last seen with the iPhone 5s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A mid-September <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-some-2022-iphones-punch-hole-display/&amp;xcust=1-1-352696-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">rumor by Ming-</a><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/358383/rumor-points-to-notchless-iphone-14-pro-affordable-iphone-14-max.html\">Chi</a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-some-2022-iphones-punch-hole-display/&amp;xcust=1-1-352696-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"> Kuo</a> said that the Pro models would have no more notch for the TrueDepth sensors at all, but rather a “hole-punch” camera similar to those on some Android devices, at least on the Pro models. That rumor was previously reported by Jon Prosser, who also reported that “the Face ID array still exists …it’s just under the display,” and clarified in October that the non-Pro models <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/542022/iphone-14-rumors-notch-hole-punch-display.html\">will likely retain the notch</a>. Additionally, Prosser says the phones will be thicker so “the camera bump is mostly gone” and all camera elements rest flush against the back glass.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September of 2021, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/538815/if-the-iphone-13-didnt-convince-you-to-upgrade-the-iphone-14-almost-certainly-will.html\">Mark Gurman of Bloomberg</a> reported that the iPhone 14 will be “a complete redesign” with “new entry-level and Pro models.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven’t heard any specific rumors about an always-on display in the iPhone 14, but after it was heavily rumored for the iPhone 13 and failed to materialize, we assume it’s been delayed until next year.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/iphone-14-render.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /></figure><p>Jon Prosser/Renders By Ian</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 14: Camera</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Big changes are apparently coming to the iPhone’s camera in the iPhone 14. According to Kuo, Apple is said to be considering a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349476/iphone-14-in-display-touch-id-fingerprint-48mp-wide-angle-camera-max-6-7-inch-price.html\">48MP sensor for the standard wide camera</a>, which would combine the pixels’ light collection in a 2×2 grid when in a low-light situation (producing a 12MP photo). The camera would reportedly be capable of shooting 8K video, at least on the Pro models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also rumored to be reserved for the Pro models would be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/iphone-14-10x-optical-zoom-3799030/\">a new periscope telephoto camera</a>, which would allow optical zoom up to 10x. We’ve seen similar cameras on other phones, including the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3608416/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-all-of-android-for-somewhat-less.html\">Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 14: Performance, battery, and biometrics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 13 is said to have 120Hz ProMotion displays on the Pro models, with panels made by Samsung, while the non-Pro variants will reportedly use regular 60Hz displays made by LG. With the iPhone 14, LG is said to be making LPTO OLED displays capable of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/350406/the-iphone-14-might-be-the-handset-of-large-phone-lovers-dreams.html\">120Hz to supply the entire iPhone line</a>. So it’s possible that the entire iPhone 14 line will have 120Hz ProMotion technology, which would follow Apple’s natural cadence: bring a feature to the Pro model first and then follow with the rest of the line a year later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every new iPhone has a new A-series system-on-chip (SoC) and we expect the iPhone 14 to follow suit. The A16, as it will likely be called, could be one of the first large-scale processor releases to use TSMC’s 3-nanometer manufacturing process, which should help improve performance, efficiency, and battery life. However, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-and-its-favorite-chipmaker-get-closer&amp;xcust=1-1-352696-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">a report in November by The Information</a> suggested Apple might stick with a 5nm process due to struggles with TSMC’s “cutting-edge manufacturing technique.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-some-2022-iphones-punch-hole-display/&amp;xcust=1-1-352696-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">a rumor by Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, Mark Gurman suggested in his <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-22/apple-s-ios-15-reversal-shows-it-s-now-actually-listening-to-users&amp;xcust=1-1-352696-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Power On newsletter</a> that Apple is testing an iPhone with an in-display Touch ID sensor that could come to the Pro models, echoing previous rumors. However, he says Apple is “all-in on Face ID for its higher-end iPhones” with the ultimate goal of “implementing Face ID in the display itself.” That tracks with Prosser’s rumor of a notch-less iPhone 14, though Gurman hasn’t said whether he expects the 2022 iPhone to retain the notch.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 14: Release date and price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple typically releases new iPhones in the fall, usually announcing them in September with a release date from two to four weeks after. We haven’t heard anything that leads us to believe that 2022 will be any different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pricing on the iPhone 14 models will probably be a little different from existing iPhones, in that there isn’t expected to be a 5.4-inch mini version but rather a lower-cost 6.7-inch Max size that Kuo said could come in at under $900. With that in mind, we expect the lineup to range from roughly $800-$1,000, depending on model and size.</p>\n</div>","author":"Jason Cross","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"343728c4d839c43e06d75aa98d0e5571bf6cbdc2ad58e61f8edaff7ccd15f9f7","category":"Apple"}
