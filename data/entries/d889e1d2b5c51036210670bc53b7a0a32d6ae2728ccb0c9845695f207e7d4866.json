But we also risk crossing thresholds in which aspects of the climate suddenly shift to new behaviors. That process seems to have happened <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/06/barents-sea-seems-to-have-crossed-a-climate-tipping-point/\">in part of the Arctic Ocean</a>, and there are indications that the main circulating current in the Atlantic Ocean <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/02/atlantic-currents-seem-to-have-started-fading-last-century/\">may be approaching a shutdown</a>.</p>\n<p>A lot of effort has gone into modeling the economic cost of climate change in general, but we haven't figured out what crossing a tipping point might do to the world economy. This week, three researchers attempted to explore the subject, integrating estimates of the cost of tipping points with combined economics/climate models. The results suggest that we may be under-valuing the current cost of our carbon emissions and accepting a much higher level of financial risk than we might think.</p>\n<h2>What percent do you tip?</h2>\n<p>Climate tipping points are easy to understand on a conceptual level. At some poorly defined point in the future's warming, some natural systems will shift to a different type of behavior. That behavior, in turn, will make it unlikely that the system will return to its initial state.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787864#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787864&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d889e1d2b5c51036210670bc53b7a0a32d6ae2728ccb0c9845695f207e7d4866","category":"Tech"}
