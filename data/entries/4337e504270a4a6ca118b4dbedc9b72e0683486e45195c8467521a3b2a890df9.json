Led by former video manager and hill climb maestro Joe Norledge, we started covering hill climb tech and racing in earnest around 2017.</p>\n<p>The subsequent popularity of BikeRadar’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/hill-climb-diaries/\">Hill Climb Diaries</a> and tech galleries from events draws us back to the scene every year – you lot bloody love a lightweight bike!</p>\n<p>The UK Hill Climb Nationals are the culmination of the intense season, and is one of the finest spectacles in cycling.</p>\n<p>This year’s Nationals were held on The Struggle – an incredible 4.4km brute of a climb rising from the Lake District town of Ambleside. I was there with present-day video manager, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/felixsmith/\">Felix Smith</a> to cover the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tech/2023-hill-climb-tech-trends/\">tech from the race</a>, with our own <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/jack-evans-hill-climb-season/\">Jack Evans</a> representing BikeRadar on the hill.</p>\n<p>As ever, the bikes were wild, the crowds rowdy and the weather damp.</p>\n<p>Attending the Nationals is the yearly highlight of my professional life and I couldn’t be happier with our coverage. Please do give the video a watch – Felix stayed up until 2.30am on Sunday to make it happen!</p>\n<p>With my love letter to watching cyclists puke on a hillside out of the way, let’s move on to what you came here for – the finest tech swag to land at BikeRadar HQ this week.</p>\n\n<h2>GripGrab DryFoot 2 waterproof overshoes</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"GripGrab DryFoot 2 waterproof overshoes\" title=\"GripGrab DryFoot 2 waterproof overshoes\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> These overshoes are more wrinkly than a goblin’s nose, but damn they work well.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Scott Windsor / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>These overshoes from GripGrab are criminally uncool, but they’re incredibly useful.</p>\n<p>Unlike regular tight-fitting <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-overshoes/\">cycling overshoes</a>, these are designed to fit over everyday shoes.
