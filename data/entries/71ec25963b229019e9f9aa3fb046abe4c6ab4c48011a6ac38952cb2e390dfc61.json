Vollering herself was a little underwhelmed by the course in the days before the race, but having found a love for gravel during the pandemic, she was keen to support the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CWMCK9MMdki/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CWMCK9MMdki/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by ⋆D E M I V O L L E R I N G⋆ (@demivollering)</a></p></div></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>After four of nine laps, Vollering and Mackaij rode away from the group and quickly found a gap, but when Lorena Wiebes counter-attacked, her DSM teammate Mackaij stopped pulling. Despite having no help, Vollering maintained their slender advantage until Wiebes finally cracked in the closing kilometres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I attacked from a group of four and Floortje joined me,” Vollering explained. “Then we heard that Lorena Wiebes had counter-attacked, so Floortje stopped working. Only I really didn’t want Lorena catching on, so I kept riding. Luckily I won the sprint.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier in the day, Tijmen Eising (VolkerWessels) won the men’s title ahead of teammates Coen Vermelfoort and Daan van Sintmaartensdijk.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CORVOS_00033730-001-1340x861.jpg\" /><figcaption>Tijmen Eising took the men’s national gravel title ahead of two VolkerWessels teammates.</figcaption></figure>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/11/demi-vollering-wins-her-first-national-titleon-gravel/\">Read More</a>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"71ec25963b229019e9f9aa3fb046abe4c6ab4c48011a6ac38952cb2e390dfc61","category":"Cycling"}
