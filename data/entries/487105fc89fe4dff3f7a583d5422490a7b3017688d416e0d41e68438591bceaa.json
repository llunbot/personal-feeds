{"title":"How I program with LLMs","link":"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-i-program-with-llms/","date":1736365896000,"content":"<p>This article is a summary of my personal experiences with using generative models while programming over the past year. It has not been a passive process. I have intentionally sought ways to use LLMs while programming to learn about them. The result has been that I now regularly use LLMs while working, and I consider their benefits to be net-positive on my productivity. (My attempts to go back to programming without them are unpleasant.)</p>\n<p>Along the way, I have found oft-repeated steps that can be automated, and a few of us are working on building those into a tool specifically for Go programming: <a href=\"https://sketch.dev\">sketch.dev</a>. Itâ€™s very early, but so far, the experience has been positive.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>I am typically curious about new technology. It took very little experimentation with LLMs for me to want to see if I could extract practical value. There is an allure to a technology that can (at least some of the time) craft sophisticated responses to challenging questions. It is even more exciting to watch a computer attempt to write a piece of a program as requested and make solid progress.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-i-program-with-llms/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-i-program-with-llms/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"David Crawshaw","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"487105fc89fe4dff3f7a583d5422490a7b3017688d416e0d41e68438591bceaa","category":"Tech"}
