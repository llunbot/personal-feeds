The company tends to hold a March or April <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484151/apple-spring-2023-event-date-time-how-to-watch-rumors.html\">spring event</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC keynote</a> in June, an event to celebrate the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">iPhone launch in September</a>, and a late fall event in October at which it has been known to release new iPads and Macs. The company has even held an event as late as November 10 (in 2020 when it unveiled the first batch of M1 Macs). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple introduced the new iPhone 15 and Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 at an event on September 12. Has the company finished releasing new products for 2023? No! There is going to be another <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/when-is-apples-next-event.html\">Apple event</a> in 2023 at which it will introduce more <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671090/new-apple-products.html\">new products</a> – we expect to see new Macs and iPads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>October 24 update: Apple has invited the press to an event on Monday 30 October at which it is expected to launch new Macs and new iPads. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When is Apple’s October event 2023?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is set to hold an event on 30 October. Dubbed Scary Fast, probably due to its proximity to Halloween (in fact if you are in the U.K. this event will start at midnight on 31 October.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’d all but given up hope for a second fall event, but in his October 22, 2023 <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p&amp;xcust=1-1-1064916-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">weekend newsletter</a> Bloomberg’s Michael Gurman indicated that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2113582/m3-mac-event-imac-macbook-pro-october.html\">Apple could hold an event on 30 or 31 October</a>. This is just a few days before the company announces its quarter four financial results on November 2. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years Apple has held a second fall event in October or November, where it has launched new Macs, iPads, and AirPods. For example, at the 2021 Unleashed event we got the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro and the third-gen AirPods, while the previous year brought the M1 versions of the 13-inch MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac mini on Tuesday, November 10. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as you can see from the list of October event dates below, Apple does not always hold an October event. Over the past 12 years, Apple has held eight October events, so it’s not unprecedented to skip it.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2022: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2021: Monday, October 18</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2020: Tuesday, October 13 and Tuesday, November 10</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2019: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2018: Tuesday, October 30</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2017: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2016: Thursday, October 27</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2015: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2014: Thursday, October 16</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2013: Tuesday, October 22</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2012: Tuesday, October 23</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2011: Tuesday, October 4</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What time will the event start?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s Scary Fast October event, will start at a different time to the usual 10 am PT. Instead Apple will kick off the event at 5 pm PT. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what that translates to around the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>U.S.: 30 October, 5 pm (PT), 8 pm (ET)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>U.K.: 31 October, 12 am (GMT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Europe: 31 October, 1 am (CET)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Australia: 31 October, 8 pm (AEDT)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s special events usually last between one and two hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to watch the Apple event</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to watch the October event live, Apple will <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673671/how-to-watch-apples-event.html\">stream the keynote</a> on its website and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/@Apple/videos&amp;xcust=1-1-1064916-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">YouTube channel</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the WWDC keynote starts you will also be able to watch it here.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What will Apple launch in October/November?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether there’s an event or not, it is possible that Apple could unveil new Macs and iPads. In fact, there are a number of reports predicting that it will do so before the end of the year. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>M3 iMac </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iMac is still running an M1 chip while the rest of the lineup is now on the second generation of Apple’s Mac chips, so it’s well overdue an update. The rumors suggest that the iMac will move straight to the M3 chip. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484743/24-inch-imac-release-date-specs-m2-m3-processor-price.html\">M3 iMac rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>13-inch MacBook Pro with M3 </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple may also be set to update the 13-inch MacBook Pro at the same time as the iMac.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mac mini with M3</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mac mini may also get an update to M3, or this may wait until 2024, with the Mac mini Pro simultaneously getting an update to M3 Pro. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2109165/m3-mac-mini-design-processor-specs-release-rumors.html\">M3 Mac mini rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>MacBook Air with M3</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the summer Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman suggested that the MacBook Air could get an M3 update this year. This seemed unlikely given the fact that the 15-inch model was only introduced in June. It now looks like Apple may update both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air in the spring of 2024, but it is possible we will see something sooner.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2000691/13-15-inch-macbook-air-m3-release-date-specs-rumors-html.html\">M3 MacBook Air rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPad mini</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad mini was last updated in 2021. A seventh-generation model is said to be coming in 2023 with a better chip and screen improvements. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/new-ipad-mini-7-2022-release-date-price-specs.html\">iPad mini 7 rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s not the only new iPad coming though.

Said to cost $99 they could be huge this Christmas, if they ever emerge. The AirPods Max also need an update. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">New AirPods rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What did Apple launch at its last October event?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On October 18, 2021, Apple launched redesigned models of the high-end MacBook Pro, with a 14-inch and 16-inch models making their debut. Powering the new MacBooks were the high-end M1 Pro and M1 Max chips that built on the already impressive M1 chips that arrived in November 2020. The laptops received new designs with slim bezels and extra ports, including MagSafe, HDMI, and an SD card slot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That event also saw Apple unveil the third-generation AirPods, new HomePod mini colors, and a cheaper, Siri-powered Apple Music subscription, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678309/apple-music-voice-plan-vs-apple-music-the-differences.html\">Apple Music Voice</a>.
