Its text, as independently verified by multiple outlets, comes down against leadership's public and private response to the suit's allegations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/activision-blizzard-staff-sign-petition-supporting-labor-lawsuit\">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> and <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/over-1-000-activision-blizzard-employees-sign-letter-co-1847364340\">Kotaku's Ethan Gach</a> reprinted content from the same petition, and both reporters claim that the petition has racked up \"over 1,000 signatures\" from current and former Activision Blizzard staffers as of press time. The petition begins by describing a public company statement offered in the wake of July 20's lawsuit, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1418619091515068421\">a private, staffwide memo sent by Activision executive vice president Frances Townsend</a>, as \"abhorrent and insulting to all that we believe our company should stand for.\"</p>\n<h2>“We will not be silenced”</h2>\n<p>Activision Blizzard's statements from lawyers and executives last week alleged that the California State's lawsuit's allegations were \"distorted, and in many cases false,\" and the petition aims its words squarely at that characterization. The letter argues that such a corporate response \"creates a company atmosphere that disbelieves victims\" and \"casts doubt on our organizations' ability to hold abusers accountable for their actions and foster a safe environment for victims to come forward in the future.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1783141#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1783141&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ed9293cea5baa1ffb3567cbfa7e6789140683a786bfef620e4d85a8bb6b2a669","category":"Tech"}
