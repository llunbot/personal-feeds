This is larger than the GoPro Hero 11’s 1/1.7in sensor, and has a bigger equivalent pixel size.</p>\n<h2>Improved image quality</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"DJI Osmo Action 4\" title=\"6-252cf5c-e1690962736706\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Osmo 4 features a bigger sensor than the Osmo 3, which the brand claims improves image quality.</span></figcaption><span> <i>DJI</i></span></div>\n<p>The 10-bit sensor can record 4k footage at up to 120fps according to DJI and is claimed to improve overall image quality.</p>\n<p>RockSteady 3.0 technology and 360-degree HorizonSteady stabilisation are designed to keep the image stable and bounce-free. A 155-degree field of view provides a wider image spread than the 148 degrees found on the Hero 11 from <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/go-pro/\">GoPro</a>.</p>\n<p>If you like getting creative with your shots, the Action 4 also has DJI’s InvisiStick feature. This removes a selfie stick from the footage.</p>\n<p>With many riders now experimenting with different ways of shooting compared to the usual chest or helmet cam POV (point of view), this could be a useful feature.</p>\n<p>The DJI Osmo Action 4 is available now and is priced at £379/$399.</p>\n<p>DJI’s Multifunctional Battery Case is said to be a versatile power bank and charges up to three of the Osmo Action 4’s batteries at once. This can also be used to charge other USB-powered devices.</p>\n<p>It’s available separately or as part of the Adventure Combo package, which includes the Osmo Action 4 and a range of accessories for £469/$499.</p>\n<h2>Familiar features</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"DJI Multifunctional Battery Case can be used as a power bank for other devices\" title=\"DJI Osmo Action 4 Launch\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The battery case can be used as a power bank for other devices.</span></figcaption><span> <i>DJI</i></span></div>\n<p>While there are claimed improvements in image quality over the Osmo Action 4’s predecessor, many of the standout features from the Action 3 remain present.</p>\n<p>As before, DJI claims the Action 4 will work in temperatures as low as -20°C and up to 45°C.</p>\n<p>If bog snorkelling or water sports are more your thing, the Osmo Action 4 is claimed to be waterproof up to depths of 18 metres, almost double the GoPro Hero 11’s 10m rating.</p>\n<p>The camera has a claimed runtime of up to 160 minutes (though DJI has not specified in which mode).</p>\n<p>The fast-charging functionality means a battery can be recharged to 80 per cent in 18 minutes according to DJI, while a full charge takes a claimed 50 minutes.</p>\n<p>A multi-functional battery case that doubles as a power bank can charge up to three spare batteries at a time.</p>\n<h2>Quick, easy and versatile mounting options</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"DJI Osmo Action 4 action camera mounted to full face helmet of male mountain biker\" title=\"DJI Osmo Action 4 Launch\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The magnetic mounts make it easy to remove the camera for storage, switch camera orientation or move to a different mount.</span></figcaption><span> <i>DJI</i></span></div>\n<p>The Action 4 mounts using DJI’s existing magnetic mounting system.</p>\n<p>This is claimed to make it quicker and easier to switch mounts on the go than a thumbwheel mount (as used by GoPro).</p>\n<p>It also means the camera accommodates native vertical video because it can be switched from landscape to portrait orientation easily.</p>\n<p>There is a cage mount for the camera to provide extra protection. This is also used to mount DJI’s wireless microphone setup, which is sold separately.</p>\n<p>The Action 4 features built-in noise reduction and the wireless microphone opens up more options for vlogging or improving your POV audio quality.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"DJI Osmo Action 4 Action Camera mounted on mountain bike handlebar in portrait orientation for social media content creation\" title=\"DJI Osmo Action 4 Launch\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Osmo Action 4 has front and rear touchscreens to view footage, frame your shots and adjust camera settings.</span></figcaption><span> <i>DJI</i></span></div>\n<p>The Action 4 retains the dual full-colour touchscreens, enabling you to not only view and frame your footage from either side of the camera, but adjust the settings too – something you can’t do with other action cameras.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<p> </p>","author":"Tom Law","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"7cc3144cf82117c6272e3acc736d701ad4a5b33dcef0411a07d31348e4ee2d2a","category":"Cycling"}
