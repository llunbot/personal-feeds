However, YouTube says that the subscription plan is still in an experimental phase, and that it could still roll out more plans to gauge user feedback.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/youtube/\">YouTube</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/02/youtube-premium-lite-subscription-ad-free/\">YouTube Tests Cheaper 'Premium Lite' Subscription for Ad-Free Viewing</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/youtube-tests-cheaper-premium-lite-subscription-for-ad-free-viewing.2306249/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fYOkZvVTKcE:4swxF_qnF2M:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fYOkZvVTKcE:4swxF_qnF2M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/fYOkZvVTKcE\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a45d807b37ab31876d43954abf34cd4339cf1b518fb269a77391818be1e06802","category":"Apple"}
