Most of these will involve small robotic spacecraft, but NASA’s ambitious <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/astronauts-are-returning-to-the-moon-but-they-wont-be-repeating-the-apollo-missions-202489\">Artemis program</a> aims to return humans to the lunar surface by the middle of the decade.</p>\n<p>There are various reasons for all this activity, including geopolitical posturing and the search for lunar resources, such as <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/19/1001857/how-moon-lunar-mining-water-ice-rocket-fuel/\">water-ice at the lunar poles</a>, which can be extracted and turned into hydrogen and oxygen propellant for rockets. However, science is also sure to be a major beneficiary.</p>\n<p>The Moon <a href=\"https://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/HRE/03_PhysicalSciences_Planetary_Science.pdf\">still has much to tell us</a> about the origin and evolution of the Solar System. It also has scientific value as a platform for observational astronomy.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932920#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932920&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"The Conversation","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c077a6209d2c9f44834d991f580444f906ce01ed70952a00c0503850e73d9456","category":"Tech"}
