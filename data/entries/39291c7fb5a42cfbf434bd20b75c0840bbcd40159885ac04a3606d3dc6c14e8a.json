Apple says the narrower borders allow the display to maximize screen area, while minimally changing the dimensions of the watch itself.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe touch sensor has been integrated into the OLED panel to reduce display thickness and borders, and Apple says a \"subtle wraparound effect\" is created by refracted light at the edge of the display for a more seamless integration with the case. Aside from offering greater readability and ease of use, the Series 7 also includes two unique watch faces — Contour and Modular Duo — designed specifically for the new device. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple says it has completely reengineered the display to reduce borders by 40%, which allows for nearly 20% more screen area than the series 6, and over 50% more screen area than Series 3. The screen borders alone are just 1.7 mm — 40 percent smaller than those on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a>. Apple also says the always-on display is 70% brighter indoors when your wrist is down. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ also has an IP6X certification, which makes it dust and water resistant, with a WR50 swim proof resistance. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple says the Series 7 charges up to 33% faster than previous models, thanks to an updated charging architecture and fast-charging USB-C cable, allowing it to go from zero to 80% charge in 45 minutes, providing eight hours of sleep tracking.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nInterface wise, Apple says buttons have been redesigned to take advantage of the larger display, while a new QWERTY keyboard lets you tap or slide from letter to letter with QuickPath. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/Apple_watch-series7_lineup-01_09142021.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new Apple Watch is available in five aluminum colors including midnight, starlight, green, blue, and (PRODUCT)RED. Stainless steel models are available in silver, graphite, and titanium is also available in multiple colors. ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ is also compatible with existing watch bands.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>\"Apple Watch Series 7 delivers significant improvements — from our largest and most advanced display, to enhanced durability and faster charging — making the world's best smartwatch better than ever before,\" said Jeff Williams, Apple's chief operating officer. \"Powered by watchOS 8, Apple Watch brings useful new capabilities to help customers stay connected, track activity and workouts, and better understand their overall health and wellness.\"</blockquote>Apple Watch Series 7 prices start from $399 and will be available later this fall.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2021-event/\">September 2021 Apple Event</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/apple-unveils-apple-watch-series-7/\">Apple Unveils Apple Watch Series 7 Featuring Larger Screen Sizes From $399</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-unveils-apple-watch-series-7-featuring-larger-screen-sizes-from-399.2310719/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hvC7PeiIuAg:_O6nQNX6F2Y:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hvC7PeiIuAg:_O6nQNX6F2Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/hvC7PeiIuAg\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"39291c7fb5a42cfbf434bd20b75c0840bbcd40159885ac04a3606d3dc6c14e8a","category":"Apple"}
