Brailsford is taking on the role of “director of sport” with Ineos, which also funds endeavors across a wider array of sports beyond cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Brailsford will “continue to lead Ineos Grenadiers,” he will do so with Rod Ellingworth as his “deputy.” Ellingworth rejoined the team at the start of the 2021 season after a stint at Bahrain-McLaren that lasted for less than a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his new role, Brailsford will oversee a collection of sports programs that include teams and athletes competing not only in cycling but also in sailing, football, rugby, and Formula 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“For me there is no more exciting place to be in global sport right now than at INEOS given the extraordinary range of talents across the different teams. I am very pleased to have this new opportunity to work together with the other team leaders to look at how we can take advantage of these collective talents and develop a wider performance framework in partnership,” Brailsford said via a team statement. “It goes without saying I am really looking forward to learning more from each of them and their teams and looking at how to put their ideas into wider practice across the INEOS sport family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This culture and approach are at the heart of what makes INEOS such a successful business – a federal structure with clear responsibilities but a desire to cross pollinate new thinking and ideas across the Group. The aim now is to replicate this model across the sports at INEOS. Alongside this new role I will continue to lead INEOS Grenadiers with Rod Ellingworth as my deputy. We are already deep into the planning for 2022 and are committed to going all in for next season.”</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/12/dave-brailsford-becomes-ineos-director-of-sport/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"ca34c433f676ec82cf935305601579ca1a98cca48797d50f6679c10e6c918749","category":"Cycling"}
