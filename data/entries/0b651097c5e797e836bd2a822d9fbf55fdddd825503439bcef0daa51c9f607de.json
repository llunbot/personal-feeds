{"title":"Cleveland Plain Dealer Editor Chris Quinn: ‘You Saw It’","link":"https://www.cleveland.com/news/2024/03/our-trump-reporting-upsets-some-readers-but-there-arent-two-sides-to-facts-letter-from-the-editor.html","date":1712010167000,"content":"\n<p>Chris Quinn, in his Letter From the Editor column at The Cleveland Plain Dealer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The north star here is truth. We tell the truth, even when it \noffends some of the people who pay us for information. </p>\n\n<p>The truth is that Donald Trump undermined faith in our elections \nin his false bid to retain the presidency. He sparked an \ninsurrection intended to overthrow our government and keep himself \nin power. No president in our history has done worse. </p>\n\n<p>This is not subjective. We all saw it. Plenty of leaders today try \nto convince the masses we did not see what we saw, but our eyes \ndon’t deceive. (If leaders began a yearslong campaign today to \nconvince us that the Baltimore bridge did not collapse Tuesday \nmorning, would you ever believe them?) Trust your eyes. Trump on \nJan. 6 launched the most serious threat to our system of \ngovernment since the Civil War. You know that. You saw it. </p>\n\n<p>The facts involving Trump are crystal clear, and as news people, \nwe cannot pretend otherwise, as unpopular as that might be with a \nsegment of our readers. There aren’t two sides to facts. People \nwho say the earth is flat don’t get space on our platforms. If \nthat offends them, so be it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s no need for any straight news publication to tie itself in knots over Trump and Trumpism. There are all sorts of reasons left-leaning Americans were opposed to right-leaning policies when Trump was president. Likewise, there are all sorts of reasons right-leaning Americans are opposed to left-leaning policies of the Biden administration. That’s called politics. And it makes sense that straight news publications try to stay above the fray on those divides.</p>\n\n<p>What Trump did after losing the 2020 election <a href=\"https://politicalwire.com/2024/03/28/liz-cheney-says-the-gop-is-a-threat-to-democracy/\">isn’t on that spectrum</a>. As Quinn put it so well, you know that. You saw it. We all saw it. It’s that simple.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/01/cleveland-plain-dealer-letter-from-editor\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0b651097c5e797e836bd2a822d9fbf55fdddd825503439bcef0daa51c9f607de","category":"Tech"}
