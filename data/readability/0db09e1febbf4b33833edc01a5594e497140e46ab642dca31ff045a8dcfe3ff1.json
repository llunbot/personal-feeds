With my teammates we won silver in the team pursuit in Rio and bronze here this week, and I just tried to build with that energy and continuation. This had always been a goal and to achieve that just opens your eyes to continue to look forward and find new opportunities and new goals for the future.”</p><p>It was a great race for home favourite Yumi Kajihara too who followed the same steady trajectory as Valente to win Japan’s first medal on the track. The bronze medal was won by Kirsten Wild (Netherlands) whose formidable sprint redeemed her bad luck earlier in the event at what is likely her last Olympic Games.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CORVOS_00033385-048-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>Jennifer Valente (USA) celebrates becoming Olympic champion in the women’s omnium.</figcaption></figure><h2>The most decorated British Olympian ever</h2><p>Jason Kenny went into the men’s keirin finals as something of an unknown quantity having missed out on the top spot earlier in the week. The team from the Netherlands proved too strong for the British lineup in the team sprint on August 3rd, and Kenny could only manage eighth in the individual event two days later.</p><p>But he was a different man in Sunday’s keirin final. With experience and an all-or-nothing attitude on his side, Kenny flew off the front early on to take his third consecutive Olympic keirin title.</p><p>“It was just too big an opportunity, really. I was in [position] one – I didn’t really want to be on the front, I felt like I had a bit of a target on my back with these guys behind. So when I looked back and saw a gap, I gave it a little squeeze and it got bigger, so I just went for it really. </p><p>“I didn’t feel like I was one of the favourites coming into the final – I wasn’t as quick as I wanted to be in the sprint and team sprint, so I kind of felt like I had nothing to lose and just put my head down and went for it. It was such a long way, it felt like the last lap took me about half an hour, but I got there in the end. I couldn’t believe I crossed the line on my own.”</p><p>This gold medal is historic in a number of ways. Kenny is not only the first athlete from any country to win eight Olympic medals on the track, but he has also overtaken Bradley Wiggins as the most successful British Olympian of all time, with seven golds and two silvers across four games.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CORVOS_00033385-034-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>Jason Kenny (Great Britain) celebrates winning the men’s keirin at the Tokyo Olympics.</figcaption></figure><h2>A second ever track gold for Canada</h2><p>Sunday’s first track cycling gold medal was won by Kelsey Mitchell in the women’s sprint. The Canadian only needed two of the three heats to out-sprint Olena Starikova (Ukraine), starting her acceleration early both times.</p><p>“I had raced a lot of my races from the back, coming around, and I knew I had a long sprint in me,” Mitchell said. “I was just going to leave it all out there and decided to go a little early and hopefully I’d be able to hold on.”</p><p>Mitchell is only the second Canadian track cyclist to win an Olympic gold medal, the first won by Lori-Ann Muenzer in 2004, also in the women’s sprint event. But what makes Mitchell’s victory even sweeter is that she only started cycling in 2017. Four years later, she’s on the top step of the podium.</p><p>“People talk about visualisation a lot in sports, and I don’t know if I did it on purpose, but I could see myself on the podium,” Mitchell said. “I decided to go and execute it, so I am super excited to step on that first step.”</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CORVOS_00033385-028-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>Kelsey Mitchell (Canada) celebrates victory in the women’s sprint at the Tokyo Olympics.</figcaption></figure></div></div>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"0db09e1febbf4b33833edc01a5594e497140e46ab642dca31ff045a8dcfe3ff1","category":"Cycling"}
