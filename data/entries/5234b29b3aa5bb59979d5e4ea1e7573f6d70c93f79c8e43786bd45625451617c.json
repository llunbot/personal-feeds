{"title":"The Spectacular Typography of the Sanborn Fire Maps","link":"https://sanbornfiremaps.com/","date":1733851154000,"content":"\n<p>Brandon Silverman:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It was September of 2011 and I saw a link on kottke.org to a\n<a href=\"https://bibliodyssey.blogspot.com/2011/02/sanborn-fire-insurance-map-typography.html\">small collection of incredible typography</a> from something\ncalled the Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps. I had never seen them\nbefore and they blew my mind. I immediately became a massive fan\nand in fact, when I got married, my wife and I designed our\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzxpFSbhTIY\">wedding invitation</a> based off of them.</p>\n\n<p>However, there has never been a place to see all of the art from\nthe maps in one place. Until now.</p>\n\n<p><em>This website is a free archive dedicated exclusively to creating\na one-stop shop for all the incredible typography and art of the\nSanborn maps.</em> It includes almost 3,500 unique decorative titles,\nall drawn before 1923. While large portions of the original maps\nhave been digitized and archived in various places both online and\noffline, there has never been a comprehensive collection of all of\nthe decorative titles from the Sanborn maps. I hope you enjoy!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I just love this style of turn-of-the-century typography and graphic design. (The <em>last</em> turn of the century, that is.) In our era, this style has been used to wonderful effect by <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/Chris-Ware/author/B001JOJLJ2?tag=df-amzn-20\">the great Chris Ware</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Via, no surprise, <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/12/the-arresting-typography-of-the-sanborn-fire-insurance-maps\">Kottke</a>.
