There are, however, still new Safari features like Tab Groups. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌macOS Monterey‌ with no changes to the Safari design will be coming on Monday, October 25. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234\">macOS Monterey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/macos-monterey-reverts-safari-changes/\">macOS Monterey Release Candidate Undoes Safari Changes, Reintroduces Old Tab Design</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-monterey-release-candidate-undoes-safari-changes-reintroduces-old-tab-design.2317630/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=vOYKk6LhozQ:R-FcmIUT9bQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=vOYKk6LhozQ:R-FcmIUT9bQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/vOYKk6LhozQ\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"61c2f61327930a620be4b35d5f5e5c6c79212fa30d5e17bc7fb63ee550d05a57","category":"Apple"}
