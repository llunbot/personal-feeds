Still, publishers often pay for the protection in an attempt to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/02/denuvo-our-cracked-re7-protection-is-still-better-than-nothing/\">extend a \"piracy-free\" time window</a> around a game's release, when most legitimate sales occur for most titles.</p>\n<p>So it's a bit odd that Bethesda Softworks has just quietly added Denuvo protections to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/ghostwire-tokyo-preview-spooky-japanese-next-gen-amnesia-meets-hexen/\"><em>Ghostwire Tokyo</em></a>, a game that was <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/tpitqy/ghostwire_tokyo_v102_2_dlcs_bonus_soundtrack/\">quickly cracked</a> after its Denuvo-free release just over a year ago.</p>\n<p>The late addition was <a href=\"https://www.dsogaming.com/news/confirmed-bethesda-has-added-denuvo-to-ghostwire-tokyo/\">confirmed by DSOGaming</a>, which says it triggered the new Denuvo protections in <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/depot/1475812/history/?changeid=M:8886739513272526916\">the game's latest Steam update</a> by simulating frequent changes in the CPU. While fresh Denuvo protection seems unlikely to impact piracy for the long-cracked title, it could serve as a shield for <a href=\"https://www.purexbox.com/news/2023/03/psa-ghostwire-tokyo-is-getting-all-new-dlc-when-it-launches-on-xbox-game-pass\">new DLC and expansion content</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931865#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931865&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c4be8d9f4c84003cbf5eaeaecb7981c6f2daa33ab8c423f10f6a80d1fd79c7f8","category":"Tech"}
