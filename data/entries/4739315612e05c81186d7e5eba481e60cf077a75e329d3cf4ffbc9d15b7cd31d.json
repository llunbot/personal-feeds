More recent events have displaced the aftermath of this devastating storm in the news, but the rebuilding is only beginning. Buildings and roads are destroyed, more than 5,000 North Carolinians are still without power, and residents of Asheville still have to boil their drinking water. Wanting to help, Rene Herse reached out to Hailey Moore to help out with a fundraiser effort.</p>\n<p>Hailey and her partner Anton Krupicka had already been working on an event in the area most affected by Hurricane Helene. They are now putting those efforts behind the Old Fort Endurance Strong Festival, a fundraising effort hosted by local organizations to rebuild the community. <strong>For the next 48 hours, we will donate 100% of the proceeds of </strong><strong>Bicycle Quarterly </strong><strong>subscriptions and sales of past editions to this fundraising effort.</strong> Read Hailey’s story and sign up to help out at <a href=\"https://www.renehersecycles.com/hurricane-helene-lets-help-together/\" target=\"_blank\">Rene Herse</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/bicycle-quarterly-hurricane-helene-fundraising-effort/\">Bicycle Quarterly Hurricane Helene Fundraising Effort</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"4739315612e05c81186d7e5eba481e60cf077a75e329d3cf4ffbc9d15b7cd31d","category":"Cycling"}
