Transmitting data in Korea \"is prohibitively expensive\" despite the company's efforts to reduce data usage, he wrote.</p>\n<p>\"First, we experimented with a peer-to-peer model for source quality. Then, we adjusted source quality to a maximum of 720p. While we have lowered costs from these efforts, our network fees in Korea are still 10 times more expensive than in most other countries. Twitch has been operating in Korea at a significant loss, and unfortunately there is no pathway forward for our business to run more sustainably in that country,\" Clancy wrote.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989493#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989493&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b5af25582f5814c14a9876651067f94487503374bad42e11a3f3b6c542ce9c14","category":"Tech"}
