The retailer is now selling prepaid boxes that customers can stuff with unwanted tech and send to Best Buy for recycling.</p>\n<p>Customers can buy a small box (9×5×3 inches) for <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/eri-mail-in-recycling-service-small/6535881.p?skuId=6535881\">$23</a> that supports up to six pounds of unwanted electronics. The medium box (9×5×3 inches) is <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/eri-mail-in-recycling-service-medium/6535883.p?skuId=6535883\">$30</a> and can support up to 15 pounds. Best Buy's announcement referred to this \"nationwide service\" as a \"pilot program.\" We've reached out to the company about what sort of limitations that implies and will update this article if we hear back. As of writing, though, the boxes seem available for purchase.</p>\n<p>Although Best Buy already has an in-store recycling program, the recycling boxes target people who might not live close to a Best Buy or have an easy way to get to one.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929294#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929294&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a9515e774b4bd89d46b103dff6813683a6087c7e3d1a324c6cb9eee6b1c294dd","category":"Tech"}
