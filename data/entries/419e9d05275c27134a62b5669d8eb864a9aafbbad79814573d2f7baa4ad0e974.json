And it is both better than we imagined, and just the tip of the iceberg of what to expect from Campy this summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First off, the basics: Yes, it is an all-new wireless electronic 2x 13-speed road bike groupset. It brings back the thumb shifter, together now with more new customizable shift buttons, too. It’s also once again lighter than the other top-tier road bike groupsets from either Shimano or SRAM. And, it is actually even noticeably cheaper than the previous generation of <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2023-campagnolo-super-record-wireless-road-bike-groupset/\" target=\"_blank\">Super Record Wireless 12sp</a> that launched just two years ago. Plus, while it is only available right now in conventional road 2x configurations, Campagnolo is calling Super Record 13 a completely new ‘platform’. And peeks have been sneaked of it already racing Unbound last weekend with a separate clutched Super Record 13 rear derailleur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, let’s dive into the details…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Campagnolo Super Record 13 wireless 2x13sp road groupset</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_photo-by-Tornanti-for-Campagnolo_riding.webp\"><img width=\"2100\" height=\"1400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_photo-by-Tornanti-for-Campagnolo_riding.webp\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record 13 wireless 2x13-speed lighter faster more affordable road groupset, climbing road\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_photo-by-Tornanti-for-Campagnolo_riding.webp 2100w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_photo-by-Tornanti-for-Campagnolo_riding-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_photo-by-Tornanti-for-Campagnolo_riding-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_photo-by-Tornanti-for-Campagnolo_riding-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_photo-by-Tornanti-for-Campagnolo_riding-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_photo-by-Tornanti-for-Campagnolo_riding-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_photo-by-Tornanti-for-Campagnolo_riding-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_photo-by-Tornanti-for-Campagnolo_riding-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photo by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tornanti_cc\" target=\"_blank\">Tornanti.cc</a>/Campagnolo)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo’s ‘<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/movement-12-explained-the-perfect-number-by-campagnolo/\" target=\"_blank\">perfect number</a>‘ of a few years ago is out the window again, in favor of one more cog for smoother gear steps <em>OR</em> wider range, depending on what you are looking for.

They wanted to create a road groupset that outperformed the competition from Shimano &amp; SRAM. But Campagnolo also decided to do that at a price level that at least some real cyclists could actually afford. That’s where we are here with this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how did Campagnolo make all that work?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lighter, Simpler, and More Affordable</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-road-groupset_thumb-shifter-is-back-baby.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-road-groupset_thumb-shifter-is-back-baby.webp\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record 13 is a lighter, faster &amp; more affordable wireless 2x13-speed road groupset, the tumbe shifter is back baby\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-road-groupset_thumb-shifter-is-back-baby.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-road-groupset_thumb-shifter-is-back-baby-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-road-groupset_thumb-shifter-is-back-baby-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-road-groupset_thumb-shifter-is-back-baby-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-road-groupset_thumb-shifter-is-back-baby-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(All photos/Cory Benson unless noted otherwise)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start with 17% more affordable, because frankly, that feels the most important to me. When Super Record Wireless 12sp launched, I was surprised at how complex some of it was, especially the shifters. Without even explaining why, the SR WRL group had these really complex titanium linages to drive two shift buttons at the bottom of the lever in a more natural arc, mimicking how your fingers move. It looked and seemed impressive, but Campagnolo never even really highlighted the solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_simplified-from-the-inside.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_simplified-from-the-inside.webp\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record 13 is a lighter, faster &amp; more affordable wireless 2x13-speed road groupset, simpler on the inside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_simplified-from-the-inside.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_simplified-from-the-inside-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_simplified-from-the-inside-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_simplified-from-the-inside-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_simplified-from-the-inside-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_simplified-from-the-inside-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_simplified-from-the-inside-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photo/Campagnolo)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of that beautiful complexity, the new Super Record 13 goes all in on simplicity. To solve the same problem, the new groupset simply puts the button back up inside the Ergopower shifter body, and a much simpler carbon lever actuates it. Plus, Campagnolo returned to their traditional thumb shift lever. The result is just a simpler setup that didn’t require that extra complexity. And ultimately, it is more practical design &amp; development decisions like this that were able to help cut costs without cutting performance. It even seems to have helped trim weight too, shedding more than 3% off the previous 12-speed wireless groupset.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1 More Gear &amp; Faster Shifting, Too!</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_now-with-13-speeds.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_now-with-13-speeds.webp\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record 13 is a lighter, faster &amp; more affordable wireless 2x13-speed road groupset, 13 gears\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_now-with-13-speeds.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_now-with-13-speeds-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_now-with-13-speeds-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_now-with-13-speeds-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_now-with-13-speeds-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, adding a 13th speed didn’t really seem to conflict with simplicity or pricing either. It is still essentially 13 gears in the same width as before – just like Ekar. So, I guess, at a certain point, adding an extra gear only added a marginal amount of more machining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Campagnolo was at first concerned that shifting across 13 cogs vs. 12 would be slower, so they worked hard to counter that. In the end, they made the new derailleur shift even quicker across the entire cassette. Just 2.4 seconds to shift all the way up the block, and only 1.9 seconds to shift all the way back down. (A full 36% faster up, and 47% faster down than Super Record WRL 12-speed!) And since the cogs are actually even closer than before, it made each individual shift even that extra bit faster than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what all is actually new?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Campy Super Record 13 Wireless Ergopower Shifters</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_new-lever-ergonomics-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_new-lever-ergonomics-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record 13 is a lighter, faster &amp; more affordable wireless 2x13-speed road groupset, new ergonomics\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_new-lever-ergonomics-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_new-lever-ergonomics-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_new-lever-ergonomics-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_new-lever-ergonomics-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_new-lever-ergonomics-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_new-lever-ergonomics-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_new-lever-ergonomics-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The real heart of the new Campagnolo Super Record 13 groupset, and ultimately the entire new platform, is the new set of wireless Ergopower shifters.

Plus, the ‘horn’ on the top of the lever is smaller, while still keeping enough real estate to hold onto if you like a hunched-over-the-levers aero position. And importantly, the pivot of the brake levers moves further away from the bar for more confident braking with less hand force, also freeing up more space under the body for your hands without actually increasing overall reach. It feels a bit like Campagnolo has managed to bring back the smaller hoods from before hydraulic brake master cylinders dominated hood shapes, now that electronic shift internals are much smaller, with just a CR 2032 coin cell battery on the outside of each.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_CR-2032-battery-under-the-hood-of-the-new-wireless-Ergopower-levers.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_CR-2032-battery-under-the-hood-of-the-new-wireless-Ergopower-levers.webp\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record 13 is a lighter, faster &amp; more affordable wireless 2x13-speed road groupset, CR2032 battery inaside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_CR-2032-battery-under-the-hood-of-the-new-wireless-Ergopower-levers.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_CR-2032-battery-under-the-hood-of-the-new-wireless-Ergopower-levers-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_CR-2032-battery-under-the-hood-of-the-new-wireless-Ergopower-levers-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_CR-2032-battery-under-the-hood-of-the-new-wireless-Ergopower-levers-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_CR-2032-battery-under-the-hood-of-the-new-wireless-Ergopower-levers-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the move back to ‘one lever, one action’ with just one hollowed-out shift paddle behind the carbon brake lever means even more space for your fingers, no matter where you hold onto the bars.

Or thanks to the extra room under the smaller Ergopower bodies, you can often even reach around while riding on the hoods to shift that extended inner button with the tip of a middle finger. Campagnolo even considered a two-way shift of the thumb button, much like a SRAM AXS Rocker shift paddle. But ultimately added the lower plastic fin to prevent the accidental shifts that could happen while sprinting in the drops.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_inside-the-smaller-Ergopower-lever-body.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_inside-the-smaller-Ergopower-lever-body.webp\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record 13 is a lighter, faster &amp; more affordable wireless 2x13-speed road groupset, inside the Ergopower\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_inside-the-smaller-Ergopower-lever-body.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_inside-the-smaller-Ergopower-lever-body-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_inside-the-smaller-Ergopower-lever-body-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_inside-the-smaller-Ergopower-lever-body-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_inside-the-smaller-Ergopower-lever-body-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_inside-the-smaller-Ergopower-lever-body-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_inside-the-smaller-Ergopower-lever-body-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe the most important addition to quiet the naysayers and draw new riders in at the same time, Campagnolo has added new Smart Buttons at the inside tips of the hoods, in a similar fashion to both top Shimano &amp; SRAM wireless groups. But these exposed Super Record 13 Smart Buttons are the smoothest and easiest I’ve ever used. Plus, the smart name signals not only that you can configure either button to control any shift direction you want (up or down, front or rear). But also they can each do more than one function – for example, short press to shift the rear up, long press to shift the front derailleur to the other position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, there’s effectively a 4th control button on each lever. The Mode button not only manages setup &amp; adjustment modes. If you pair a Garmin or Wahoo computer, it will default to controlling your GPS device and/or connected accessories, without having to require that extra function from the Smart Buttons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Super Record 13 Wireless Front &amp; Rear Derailleurs</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_rear-derailleur.webp\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_rear-derailleur.webp\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record 13 is a lighter, faster &amp; more affordable wireless 2x13-speed road groupset, rear derailleur\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_rear-derailleur.webp 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_rear-derailleur-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_rear-derailleur-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_rear-derailleur-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_rear-derailleur-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_rear-derailleur-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, with new 13-speed shifters comes new matching, fully wireless derailleurs.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything is all new here. But the biggest difference is probably the lighter and lower-profile design, said to “reduce right side overhang” by 25% compared to Super Record Wireless 12. That means a more forward derailleur position for improved chain wrap across a wider range of cog sizes, and less derailleur exposed to either wind or impacts. But also reduced weight, too. Again saving weight with a full carbon cage.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_Campy-UDH.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_Campy-UDH.webp\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record 13 is a lighter, faster &amp; more affordable wireless 2x13-speed road groupset, UDH-compatible Campy hanger\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_Campy-UDH.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_Campy-UDH-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_Campy-UDH-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_Campy-UDH-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_Campy-UDH-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new rear derailleur also features a new mount design, much like Shimano’s direct mount design.

That essentially comes from the monoblock machined steel construction, new tooth &amp; shift ramp profiles, and new surface treatment. Like Ekar, the first three cogs form a tiny machined monoblock, as do the final 4 or 5 cogs machined from a single block of forged steel. Then, the remaining middle cogs are formed loose, with conventional cassette spacers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_black-chrome-coated-casette.webp\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_black-chrome-coated-casette.webp\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record 13 is a lighter, faster &amp; more affordable wireless 2x13-speed road groupset, cassette with black chrome finish\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_black-chrome-coated-casette.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_black-chrome-coated-casette-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_black-chrome-coated-casette-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_black-chrome-coated-casette-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_black-chrome-coated-casette-768x461.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_black-chrome-coated-casette-2048x1229.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, an all-new surface treatment that Campy calls ‘black chrome’ protects the cassette for durability, while at the same time significantly reducing drivetrain running noise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, the new tighter 13-speed cog spacing and smaller gearing jumps mean quicker, more precise shifting.

But the brakes themselves didn’t change, although they did get new titanium bolts to shed a gram or two along the way. Campy also added a new sintered brake pad option for improved brake performance in wet weather. Campagnolo Super Record 13 groupsets will still come standard with the same organic pads, though.

2x13sp road setup. You pick your idea gearing setup, whether you are looking for race-ready speed or all-day endurance gearing. A reminder, that’s 900€ cheaper than <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2023-campagnolo-super-record-wireless-road-bike-groupset/\" target=\"_blank\">Super Record Wireless 12</a> by the way, or just 300€ more than the ‘budget’ <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/campagnolo-super-record-s-wireless-special-edition-road-bike-groupset-drops-in-price/\" target=\"_blank\">Super Record S WRL 12</a>. Both of those groupsets carry on for 12-speed fans, and maybe you’ll find some closeout deals on them soon, but we suspect most people buying new premium Italian groupsets will only be interested in 13-speed now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking to get a new bike already kitted out with the latest Campagnolo gruppo, you’ll likely get a first shot with classic big Italian bike brands like Colnago, De Rosa, or Pinarello, for example. Campagnolo says they’ll be some of the first to offer the new groupset, but many more that already sell Campy specs will quickly follow suit. And Campagnolo are working hard to expand their OEM partnerships, especially with Super Record 13 continuing to grow across several dropbar markets this summer and coming autumn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Custom bike builders are also expected to be a popular option for Campy Super Record 13 builds. Campagnolo has already prepared a new dream build gallery as a place to share the most unique custom builds with their new groupset.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_photo-by-Tornanti-for-Campy_test-riding-in-the-hills-above-Vicenza.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_photo-by-Tornanti-for-Campy_test-riding-in-the-hills-above-Vicenza.webp\" alt=\"Riding Campy Super Record 13 outside of Vicenza, Italy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_photo-by-Tornanti-for-Campy_test-riding-in-the-hills-above-Vicenza.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_photo-by-Tornanti-for-Campy_test-riding-in-the-hills-above-Vicenza-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_photo-by-Tornanti-for-Campy_test-riding-in-the-hills-above-Vicenza-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_photo-by-Tornanti-for-Campy_test-riding-in-the-hills-above-Vicenza-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_photo-by-Tornanti-for-Campy_test-riding-in-the-hills-above-Vicenza-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_photo-by-Tornanti-for-Campy_test-riding-in-the-hills-above-Vicenza-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Campagnolo-Super-Record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-lighter-faster-more-affordable-road-groupset_photo-by-Tornanti-for-Campy_test-riding-in-the-hills-above-Vicenza-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photo by Tornanti/Campagnolo)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep your eyes peeled for <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-ride-a-better-campy-super-record-13-group-points-to-a-campagnolo-comeback/\" target=\"_blank\">our first ride impressions</a> later today, from the hills above the Vicenza factory and headquarters!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://Campagnolo.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Campagnolo.com</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/campagnolo-super-record-13-wireless-2x13-speed-road-groupset-is-lighter-faster-more-affordable-and-coming-to-gravel-soon/\">Campagnolo Super Record 13-speed is Lighter &amp; Cheaper Than 12, Gravel-ready &amp; More!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"419e9d05275c27134a62b5669d8eb864a9aafbbad79814573d2f7baa4ad0e974","category":"Cycling"}
