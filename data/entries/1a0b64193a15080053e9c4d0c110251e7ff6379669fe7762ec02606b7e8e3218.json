The much-anticipated new trailer debuted during <em>Discovery’s</em> New York Comic Con 2021 panel, which included cast members Sonequa Martin-Green, Anthony Rapp, Mary Wiseman, Wilson Cruz, David Ajala, and Blu del Barrio, as well as showrunner and executive producer Michelle Paradise.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for prior seasons below.)</strong></p>\n<p>As I've <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/celebrate-first-contact-day-with-this-star-trek-discovery-s4-trailer/\">written previously</a>, in S3, Michael Burnham (Martin-Green), <em>Discovery</em>, and her crew <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Discovery_(season_3)\">arrived in the future</a> and found that Control's plan had been thwarted: life still exists.
