{"title":"Taska Is Now Part of Leitmotif (Developers of Kaleidoscope)","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/04/makers-of-kaleidoscope-just-acquired-another-native-mac-app-for-developers-and-everything-is-50-off/","date":1741135011000,"content":"\n<p>Zac Hall, writing at 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Leitmotif, the team behind the awesome diff and merge Mac app\nKaleidoscope, is expanding its portfolio of native Mac apps for\ndevelopers. The company has acquired Taska, a native Mac app that\nserves as a frontend for web services like GitHub and GitLab.\n[...] To celebrate its release of Taska 1.3, Leitmotif is\n<a href=\"https://leitmotif.dev/promotion\">discounting its apps by 50%</a> for a limited time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When Taska debuted last year, its original developers (Made by Windmill) sponsored DF for the week to promote it (the app was briefly named Sonar, before some sort of legal contretemps prompted a change), and thanking them, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/25/sonar\">I wrote</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Taska combines the lightweight UI of a to-do app with the power of\nenterprise-level issue tracking, all in a native app built by\nlong-time Mac nerds. The interface is deceptively simple, and very\nintuitive. Fast and fluid too. Everything that’s great about\nnative Mac apps is exemplified by Taska. If you’ve ever thought,\n“Man, if only Apple made a native GitHub client...”, you should\nrun, not walk, to download it.</p>\n\n<p>Taska saves all your changes directly to GitHub/GitLab using their\nofficial APIs, so your data remains secure on GitHub’s servers — not Taska’s. Do you have team members not using Taska? No problem.\nChanges you make in Taska are 100% compatible with the web UI.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Leitmotif’s Kaleidoscope is a <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/17/kaleidoscope-20\">longtime</a> stalwart in any Mac nerd’s toolbox. I can’t think of a better sibling to an app like Taska. (A few weeks ago I ran into a gnarly syncing glitch with a long log file, where there wasn’t just an old version and new one, but two different “new” versions from two different machines. Kaleidoscope got me out of that jam, no sweat.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/taska-leitmotif\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"847a98ea92ac04d8b51aefcb0dde0bd3a842ccdd727c5bf4f6c220a3790da893","category":"Tech"}
