The streaming platform followed up today with a special three-minute featurette on the making of the Star Wars series' sophomore outingâ€”including a hint that we'll probably be seeing a major tragic event in the Star Wars canon this season.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for season 1 below.)</strong></p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/official-andor-trailer-shows-us-what-the-birth-of-a-revolution-looks-like/\">previously reported</a>, the story begins five years before the events of <em>Rogue One</em>, with the Empire's destruction of Cassian Andor's (Diego Luna) home world, and follows his transformation from a \"revolution-averse\" cynic to a major player in the nascent rebellion who is willing to sacrifice himself to save the galaxy. S1 left off with Cassian returning to Ferrix for the funeral of his adoptive mother, Maarva (Fiona Shaw), rescuing a friend from prison, and dodging an assassination attempt. A post-credits scene showed prisoners assembling the firing dish of the now-under-construction Death Star.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/an-inside-look-at-the-making-of-andor-s2/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/an-inside-look-at-the-making-of-andor-s2/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cbf1a73b3bd01cca7f40262a8548a3f75153debc09bd3754f0e7f14c61853c37","category":"Tech"}
