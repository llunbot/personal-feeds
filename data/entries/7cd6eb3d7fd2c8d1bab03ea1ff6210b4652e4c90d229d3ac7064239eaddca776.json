On Thursday, Jaguar announced that it's the latest automaker to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/07/our-big-unanswered-questions-about-the-switch-to-tesla-style-ev-plugs/\">decide to change its charger plugs</a> on its battery electric vehicles to the Tesla-style NACS port, securing all-important access to the Tesla Supercharger network in the process. As with all the other NACS announcements we've seen since May, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/06/with-ford-and-gms-help-tesla-reignites-the-charging-standard-war/\">when Ford went first and opened the floodgates</a>, native NACS ports will appear on Jaguars in 2025.</p>\n<p>Coincidentally, that's when the next new electric Jaguar will appear, too. The British brand was an early entrant to the long-range electric vehicle segment with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/06/forget-about-that-tesla-the-jaguar-i-pace-is-the-most-compelling-ev-yet/\">the I-Pace</a>, a bespoke BEV that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/04/the-jaguar-i-pace-wins-world-car-of-the-year-world-green-car-awards/\">wowed road testers</a> in 2018. But despite <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/03/a-cab-ride-in-a-jaguar-waymo-will-go-classy-for-20000-electric-robotaxis/\">a big order from Waymo</a> to use I-Paces as robotaxis, the I-Pace's relatively small interior and high purchase price put off potential private customers, making it a relatively rare sight on North American roads outside of the Bay Area.</p>\n<p>The I-Pace got a mild midlife refresh at the beginning of this year, but it remains the sole EV in Jaguar's lineup for now. We were supposed to see an electric replacement for the venerable Jaguar XJ sedan, and development of the car was at an advanced stage when it was <a href=\"https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131298_jaguar-land-rover-cancels-xj-flagship-ev-carries-on-hydrogen-fuel-cell-development\">suddenly canceled</a> in 2021, mere months from its debut.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970093#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970093&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
