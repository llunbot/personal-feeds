And people are always spotting what they believe to be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2011/jul/21/jesus-food-sightings\">face of Jesus</a> in burnt toast and many other (<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/arielknutson/people-who-found-jesus-in-their-food\">so many</a>) ordinary foodstuffs. There was even a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/faceinthings?lang=en\">now-defunct Twitter account</a> devoted to curating images of the \"faces in things\" phenomenon.</p>\n<p>The phenomenon's fancy name is facial <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia\">pareidolia</a>. Scientists at the University of Sydney have found that, not only do we see faces in everyday objects, our brains even process objects for emotional expression much like we do for real faces rather than discarding the objects as \"false\" detections. This shared mechanism perhaps evolved as a result of the need to quickly judge whether a person is a friend or foe.
