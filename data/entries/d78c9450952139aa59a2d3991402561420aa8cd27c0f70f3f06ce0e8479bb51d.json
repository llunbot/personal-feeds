The new tires include one gravel tire and two MTB tires. Introducing the <a href=\"https://www.amclassic.com/collections/tires/products/grus\" target=\"_blank\">Grus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amclassic.com/collections/tires/products/cumbre\" target=\"_blank\">Cumbre</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amclassic.com/collections/tires/products/terestre\" target=\"_blank\">Terestre</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The year was 2018, and American Classic was taking a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/american-classic-voluntarily-closes-taiwan-factory/\" target=\"_blank\">step back after 30+ years in the industry</a>. Only to<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/american-classic-is-back-with-road-gravel-tires-equipped-with-a-tiny-price-tag/\" target=\"_blank\"> emerge in 2021</a> with a new line of tires… and the tires were only $35 each, and in the landscape of $100 bicycle tires, this was a big deal. The tires created a lot of buzz. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were some minor hiccups in the first batch or so of tires, but people were generally stoked on the tires. They went back and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/american-classic-tire-line-2022/\" target=\"_blank\">improved the line</a>, bumped the price by $10, added a handsome dark brown wall to the available options and all was good. Check out the lil review I did of a set of their Kimberlites<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/american-classic-kimberlite-grave-bike-tire-reivew/\" target=\"_blank\"> here</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On to the new ones…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>American Classic Grus “<em>The Ultimate Gravel Athlete’s Companion</em>.”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>Grus excels on hardpack conditions with its fast-rolling tread and ensures optimal traction on loose terrain with its aggressive outer edge. Featuring American Classic’s Stage 5S Armor construction, Grus offers a perfect balance of lightweight, supple ride quality, and unrivaled anti-cut protection</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/American-Classic-Grus-Gravel-Tire-side-1.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/American-Classic-Grus-Gravel-Tire-side-1-800x800.jpeg\" alt=\"American Classic Grus Gravel Tire side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/American-Classic-Grus-Gravel-Tire-side-1-800x800.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/American-Classic-Grus-Gravel-Tire-side-1-297x297.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/American-Classic-Grus-Gravel-Tire-side-1-120x120.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/American-Classic-Grus-Gravel-Tire-side-1-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/American-Classic-Grus-Gravel-Tire-side-1.jpeg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo c.
