The delisting comes earlier than expected for the title and coincides with the company's launch of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/ea-friendship-ended-with-fifa-now-ea-sports-fc-is-my-best-friend/\">the newly FIFA-license-free <em>EA Sports FC 24</em></a>.</p>\n<p>While many reports suggest there has been a recent mass purge of all legacy <em>FIFA</em> games from online stores, EA has a history of delisting older sports titles at a pretty regular cadence. <em>FIFA 22</em>, for instance, was <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/changelist/18816609/\">delisted</a> from <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230602183644/https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/fifa-22-nintendo-switch-legacy-edition-switch/\">digital storefronts</a> in May, roughly seven months after the launch of the subsequent <em>FIFA 23</em>. And <em>FIFA 21</em> wasn't taken down from Steam <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/app/1313860/history/?changeid=15214908\">until June 2022</a>, about eight months after <em>FIFA 22</em>'s launch.</p>\n    <div>\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                                                <h3>EA Sports FC 24                                                </h3>\n                        <div>\n                                                            <ul>\n                                        \n                                    <li>\n                                        <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Zv3U7z\" target=\"_blank\">$70 PlayStation 5 at Amazon</a>\n                                    </li>\n                                        \n                                    <li>\n                                        <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Pt0ZaK\" target=\"_blank\">$60 Nintendo Switch at Amazon</a>\n                                    </li>\n                                        \n                                    <li>\n                                        <a href=\"https://amzn.to/45b8qJk\" target=\"_blank\">$70 Xbox Series X at Amazon</a>\n                                    </li>\n                                        \n                                    <li>\n                                        <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3PUwJa8\" target=\"_blank\">$70 PlayStation 4 at Amazon</a>\n                                    </li>\n                                                                    </ul>\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <div>(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<p><em>FIFA 23</em>, on the other hand, has been delisted less than a year from its October 2022 launch. <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/app/1811260/history/\">SteamDB tracking data</a> suggests that the delisting came on September 21, the day before the new <em>EA Sports FC</em> became available for a 10-hour early access trial for EA Play members.
