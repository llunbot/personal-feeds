{"title":"Yahoo Lays Off the Leaders of Engadget","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/22/24080215/engadget-layoffs-tech-news-blogs-editorial-restructuring","date":1708655519000,"content":"\n<p>Mia Sato, reporting for The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Engadget, which is operated by Yahoo, will lay off 10 employees, according to people with knowledge of the situation who say staff were “blindsided” by the decision. In addition to cutting staff, the editorial team will split into two sections: “news and features” and “reviews and buying advice.” The news teams will focus on traffic growth, while the reviews teams will report to commerce leaders.</p>\n\n<p>As part of the layoffs, editor-in-chief Dana Wollman is out, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danawollman/status/1760727491285799287\">according to posts on X</a>, as is <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@_terrence_obrien_/post/C3qRvjJRbxQ\">managing editor Terrence O’Brien</a>. People with knowledge of the situation say that there are no plans to replace Wollman.</p>\n\n<p>“[The changes] will allow us to streamline our work, increase our velocity, and ultimately deliver the best content to our readers,” Sarah Priestley, who is listed as Engadget’s general manager on its masthead, wrote in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxwelltani/status/1760714150354014545\">a memo shared by Max Tani at Semafor</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That memo contains this gem of a sentence (boldface emphasis from original):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I am reaching out today to share that <b>we’re making changes to our organization</b>, which will allow us to streamline our work, increase our velocity and ultimately deliver the best content to our readers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The sort of executive who calls what their own publication creates “content” is exactly the sort of asshole who thinks talented editors and writers can be laid off while increasing “velocity” and the quality of the work. I predict the next time Engadget is in the news will be when they’re caught in a <a href=\"https://futurism.com/sports-illustrated-ai-generated-writers\">Sports-Illustrated-esque AI-generated content</a> (there, <em>content</em> is apt) fiasco.</p>\n\n<p>A great brand and publication laid to waste. That’s the Yahoo way.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/22/yahoo-engadget-layoffs\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"df80cde9cff59b664dc485ce6ee81c0382aa732e6d584d80af7673f3da1f0232","category":"Tech"}
