Plus, its 400Wh battery is a claimed 2400g lighter than the CX’s 750Wh battery. That’s more than 3kg lighter, or nearly 14% weight savings over the complete <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/canyon-neuronon-cf-carbon-all-mountain-ebike/\" target=\"_blank\">Neuron:ON CF 8</a> that I rode last summer. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_rear-end-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_rear-end-detail-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Neuron:ONfly lightweight 140mm carbon trail ebike with Bosch SX motor, rear triangle drivetrain detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_rear-end-detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_rear-end-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_rear-end-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_rear-end-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_rear-end-detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_rear-end-detail-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_rear-end-detail.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the powertrain, the carbon frame itself isn’t identical to the heavier Neuron:ON, but it’s very similar. Obviously, the downtube could be made smaller with the smaller, lighter 400WH internal battery. And the chainstays have dropped a bit with the extra space available around the smaller motor casing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>But what about lightweight range?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_pan-shot-climbing.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_pan-shot-climbing-1536x864.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Neuron:ONfly lightweight 140mm carbon trail ebike with Bosch SX motor, climbing pan shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_pan-shot-climbing-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_pan-shot-climbing-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_pan-shot-climbing-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_pan-shot-climbing-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_pan-shot-climbing-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_pan-shot-climbing.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, range is genuinely decreased from that huge 750Wh battery to this 400Wh one. But the Bosch SX motor is said to be more energy efficient. And the more natural ride feel offers welcome support on the climbs, but encourages you to step up your pedal power output, as well. It also is much more reasonable to pedal a light eMTB in Eco mode. And still bearable to pedal it uphill with a drained battery, compared to the full-power ebikes out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_eMTB-in-a-forest.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"922\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_eMTB-in-a-forest-1536x922.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Neuron:ONfly lightweight 140mm carbon trail ebike with Bosch SX motor, angled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_eMTB-in-a-forest-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_eMTB-in-a-forest-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_eMTB-in-a-forest-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_eMTB-in-a-forest-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_eMTB-in-a-forest.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Range-wise, Canyon claims the new Neuron:ONfly will still give you support for 1000m of climbing in Turbo mode. That’s plenty to cover most regular mountain bike trail rides. And why carry extra battery weight around if you aren’t going to use it. I live and ride in the mountains. And 1000m is a solid ride ranging from 25-60km in length depending on how hard you want to push the steep hills. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_range-extender-battery.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_range-extender-battery-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Neuron:ONfly lightweight 140mm carbon trail ebike with Bosch SX motor, range extender bottle battery\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_range-extender-battery-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_range-extender-battery-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_range-extender-battery-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_range-extender-battery-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_range-extender-battery-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_range-extender-battery-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canyon-Neuron-ONfly-lightweight-carbon-trail-ebike_photo-by-Ruper-Fowler_range-extender-battery.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you do actually need extra power occasionally for some longer riding. The SX-powered Canyon Neuron:ONfly is compatible with Bosch’s 250Wh PowerMore range extender bottle battery.
