{"title":"AWS Week in Review ‚Äì February 27, 2023","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-week-in-review-february-27-2023/","date":1677524050000,"content":"<p>A couple days ago, I had the honor of doing a live stream on generative AI, discussing recent innovations and concepts behind the current generation of large language and vision models and how we got there. In today‚Äôs roundup of news and announcements, I will share some additional information‚Äîincluding an expanded partnership to make generative AI more accessible, a blog post about diffusion models, and our weekly Twitch show on Generative AI. Let‚Äôs dive right into it!</p> \n<p><strong><span>Last Week‚Äôs Launches</span> </strong><br /> Here are some launches that got my attention during the previous week:</p> \n<p><strong>Integrated Private Wireless on AWS</strong> ‚Äì The <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/telecom/integrated-private-wireless/\">Integrated Private Wireless on AWS</a> program is designed to provide enterprises with managed and validated private wireless offerings from leading communications service providers (CSPs). The offerings integrate CSPs‚Äô private 5G and 4G LTE wireless networks with AWS services across <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/\">AWS Regions</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones\">AWS Local Zones</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/\">AWS Outposts</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/snow/\">AWS Snow Family</a>. For more details, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/aws-launches-integrated-private-wireless-on-aws-program/\">read this Industries Blog post</a> and check out¬†<a href=\"https://pages.awscloud.com/rs/112-TZM-766/images/AWS%20Integrated%20Private%20Wireless%20eBook.pdf\">this eBook.</a> And, if you‚Äôre attending the <a href=\"https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/\">Mobile World Congress Barcelona</a> this week, stop by the AWS booth at the Upper Walkway, South Entrance, at the Fira Barcelona Gran Via, to learn more.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS Glue Crawlers ‚Äì </strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/02/aws-glue-crawlers-integration-lake-formation/\">Now integrate with Lake Formation.</a> AWS Glue Crawlers are used to discover datasets, extract schema information, and populate the AWS Glue Data Catalog. With this Glue Crawler and Lake Formation integration, you can configure a crawler to use Lake Formation permissions to access an S3 data store or a Data Catalog table with an underlying S3 location within the same AWS account or another AWS account. You can configure an existing Data Catalog table as a crawler‚Äôs target if the crawler and the Data Catalog table reside in the same account. To learn more, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/introducing-aws-glue-crawlers-using-aws-lake-formation-permission-management/\">check out this Big Data Blog post</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/02/26/aws_glue_crawler_lake_formation.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/02/26/aws_glue_crawler_lake_formation.png\" alt=\"AWS Glue Crawlers now support integration with AWS Lake Formation\" width=\"591\" height=\"367\" /></a></p> \n<p><strong>Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor</strong>¬†‚Äì You can <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/02/amazon-sagemaker-model-monitor-dashboard/\">now launch and configure¬†Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor from the SageMaker Model Dashboard</a> using a code-free point-and-click setup experience. SageMaker Model Dashboard gives you unified monitoring across all your models by providing insights into deviations from expected behavior, automated alerts, and troubleshooting to improve model performance. Model Monitor can detect drift in data quality, model quality, bias, and feature attribution and alert you to take remedial actions when such changes occur.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon EKS</strong> ‚Äì¬†<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/02/amazon-eks-distro-kubernetes-version-1-25/\">Now supports Kubernetes version 1.25</a>. Kubernetes 1.25 introduced several new features and bug fixes, and you can now use Amazon EKS and Amazon EKS Distro to run Kubernetes version 1.25. You can create new 1.25 clusters or upgrade your existing clusters to 1.25 using the Amazon EKS console, the eksctl command line interface, or through an infrastructure-as-code tool. To learn more about this release named ‚ÄúCombiner,‚Äù <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-now-supports-kubernetes-version-1-25/\">check out this Containers Blog post</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Detective ‚Äì</strong> <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/02/amazon-detective-interactive-workshop-investigating-security-issues/\">New self-paced workshop available.</a> You can now learn to use Amazon Detective with a new self-paced workshop in AWS Workshop Studio. AWS Workshop Studio is a collection of self-paced tutorials designed to teach practical skills and techniques to solve business problems. The Amazon Detective workshop is designed to teach you how to use the primary features of Detective through a series of interactive modules that cover topics such as security alert triage, security incident investigation, and threat hunting. <a href=\"https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/7e5cf273-0b23-4d6d-8889-8f2cfd6eb4f9/en-US\">Get started with the Amazon Detective Workshop</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What's New at AWS page.</a></p> \n<p><strong><u>Other AWS News<br /> </u></strong>Here are some additional news items and blog posts that you may find interesting:</p> \n<p><strong><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f917.png\" alt=\"ü§ó\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2764.png\" alt=\"‚ù§\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2601.png\" alt=\"‚òÅ\" /> AWS and Hugging Face collaborate to make generative AI more accessible and cost-efficient</strong> ‚Äì This previous week, we announced an expanded collaboration between AWS and <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/blog/aws-partnership\">Hugging Face</a> to accelerate the training, fine-tuning, and deployment of large language and vision models used to create generative AI applications.
