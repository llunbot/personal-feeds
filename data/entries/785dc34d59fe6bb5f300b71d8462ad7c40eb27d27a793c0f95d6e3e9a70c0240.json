BlackCat does not anticipate Reddit cooperating, and says that it expects to leak the data.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt the time of the hack, Reddit said that no user passwords, accounts, or credit card details were impacted, but internal documentation, code, and internal dashboards and business systems were obtained.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBlackCat's demand for an API rollback comes as Reddit prepares to begin charging developers for access to its API. Reddit's fees are putting popular third-party Reddit clients <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/31/reddit-api-changes-pricing-apollo/\">like Apollo out of business</a>, and the API changes have resulted in protests in the form of subreddit blackouts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nReddit CEO Steve Huffman has said that Reddit has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/15/reddit-threatens-to-remove-subreddit-moderators/\">no plan to change</a> its new API business model in light of the negative feedback, and it is unlikely that the company will change its API pricing due to the data leak threat.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/reddit/\">Reddit</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/19/hackers-threaten-reddit-into-api-changes/\">Hackers Threaten to Release Reddit Data Unless API Changes Are Rolled Back</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hackers-threaten-to-release-reddit-data-unless-api-changes-are-rolled-back.2393542/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"785dc34d59fe6bb5f300b71d8462ad7c40eb27d27a793c0f95d6e3e9a70c0240","category":"Apple"}
