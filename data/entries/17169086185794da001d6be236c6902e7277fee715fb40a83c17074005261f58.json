We've also rounded up some of Apple's performance claims, so people with older Macs can see exactly what they're getting if they upgrade (Apple still likes to use the M1 as a baseline, acknowledging that the year-over-year gains are sometimes minor and that many people are still getting by just fine with some version of the M1 chip).</p>\n<h2>Comparing all the M4 chips</h2>\n<div><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>CPU P/E-cores</th>\n<th>GPU cores</th>\n<th>RAM options</th>\n<th>Display support (including internal)</th>\n<th>Memory bandwidth</th>\n<th>Available in</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Apple M4 (low)</b></td>\n<td>4/4</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>16/24GB</td>\n<td>Up to two</td>\n<td>120GB/s</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/imac/blue-24-inch-standard-glass-apple-m4-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-8-core-gpu-16gb-memory-256gb\">$1,299 iMac</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Apple M4 (high)</b></td>\n<td>4/6</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>16/24/32GB</td>\n<td>Up to three</td>\n<td>120GB/s</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/imac/blue-24-inch-standard-glass-apple-m4-chip-with-10-core-cpu-and-10-core-gpu-16gb-memory-256gb\">$1,499 iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini/apple-m4-chip-with-10-core-cpu-and-10-core-gpu-16gb-memory-256gb\">$599 Mac mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch-space-black-standard-display-apple-m4-chip-with-10-core-cpu-and-10-core-gpu-16gb-memory-512gb\">$1,599 MacBook Pro</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Apple M4 Pro (low)</b></td>\n<td>8/4</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>24/48/64GB</td>\n<td>Up to three</td>\n<td>273GB/s</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini/apple-m4-pro-chip-with-12-core-cpu-16-core-gpu-24gb-memory-512gb\">$1,399 Mac mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch-space-black-standard-display-apple-m4-pro-chip-with-12-core-cpu-16-core-gpu-24gb-memory-512gb\">$1,999 14-inch MBP</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Apple M4 Pro (high)</b></td>\n<td>10/4</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>24/48/64GB</td>\n<td>Up to three</td>\n<td>273GB/s</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini/apple-m4-pro-chip-with-12-core-cpu-16-core-gpu-24gb-memory-512gb\">$1,599 Mac mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch-space-black-standard-display-apple-m4-pro-chip-with-12-core-cpu-16-core-gpu-24gb-memory-512gb\">$2,199 14-inch MBP</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch-space-black-standard-display-apple-m4-pro-with-14-core-cpu-and-20-core-gpu-24gb-memory-512gb\">$2,499 16-inch MBP</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Apple M4 Max (low)</b></td>\n<td>10/4</td>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>36GB</td>\n<td>Up to five</td>\n<td>410GB/s</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch-space-black-standard-display-apple-m4-pro-chip-with-12-core-cpu-16-core-gpu-24gb-memory-512gb\">$3,199 14-inch MBP</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch-space-black-standard-display-apple-m4-max-with-14-core-cpu-and-32-core-gpu-36gb-memory-1tb\">$3,499 16-inch MBP</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Apple M4 Max (high)</b></td>\n<td>12/4</td>\n<td>40</td>\n<td>48/64/128GB</td>\n<td>Up to five</td>\n<td>546GB/s</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch-space-black-standard-display-apple-m4-max-with-14-core-cpu-and-32-core-gpu-36gb-memory-1tb\">$3,699 14-inch MBP</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch-space-black-standard-display-apple-m4-max-with-14-core-cpu-and-32-core-gpu-36gb-memory-1tb\">$3,999 16-inch MBP</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p>At least as far as the Mac is concerned, Apple has technically released six different chips this week under three different brand names.
