Lovely coffee stop in Menton. Except someone nicked my bike <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f926-200d-2642-fe0f.png\" /> Now in an Uber home. It’s a Dogma F with F12 stickers. Random miss matched wheels and in need of a wash <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/oneofakind?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#oneofakind</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ipBfMIJ9nF\">pic.twitter.com/ipBfMIJ9nF</a></p>— Geraint Thomas (@GeraintThomas86) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeraintThomas86/status/1459891263633870859?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 14, 2021</a></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>Bike thefts do not often have a <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/three-years-later-my-stolen-bike-is-back/\">happy ending</a>, and Thomas was probably not holding out hopes of seeing his “random miss matched wheels” again. In an unlikely turn of events, however, his bike was back in his hands within three hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A follow-up from Thomas praised the good work of Menton Police, and showed three of the French Riviera’s Finest posing with a Pinarello with – as advertised – mismatched wheels. “All’s well that ends well,” Thomas wrote. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Look what showed up!! Boy have I got a good story for you on next week’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gtcc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@gtcc_</a> pod <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f923.png\" /> Big thanks to the Menton Police for their help <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f46e-200d-2642-fe0f.png\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f44c.png\" /> All’s well that ends well <a href=\"https://t.co/qW5x8qXnbt\">pic.twitter.com/qW5x8qXnbt</a></p>— Geraint Thomas (@GeraintThomas86) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeraintThomas86/status/1459938443719553030?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 14, 2021</a></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>Thomas is not the first pro cyclist to fall victim to bike theft this year. The Italian national track team had <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/10/20-of-team-italys-highly-distinctive-pinarello-track-bikes-have-been-stolen/\">20 Pinarellos – some gold painted – stolen</a> during the 2021 World Track Championships; they were later recovered <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/10/romanian-police-find-bikes-stolen-from-italian-track-team/\">during a drug bust in Romania</a>. Twelve of <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/bikes-of-team-bikeexchange-stolen-at-tour-de-lardeche/\">Team BikeExchange’s team issue Bianchis were also stolen</a> at this year’s Tour Cycliste Féminin International de l’Ardèche.  </p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/11/geraint-thomas-had-his-bike-stolen-for-three-hours/\">Read More</a>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"4785a6f2a6d0e9c85728b15e85d9748ecdcf4e41706fb1e4f0d2352a71a80b23","category":"Cycling"}
