Meanwhile, Ian recounts sharing changing room beers with the Aussies, why he was never into sledging, how to keep a cool head in the middle of a storm, and the long-term impact of his charity work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interview begins at 7:00.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/cyclist-magazine-podcast/episodes/131-bradley-wiggins-and-ian-botham-in-conversation-plus-beef\" target=\"_blank\">Bradley Wiggins and Ian Botham on the Cyclist Magazine Podcast now on Acast</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\">all episodes</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"https://www.insta360.com/sal/x5?utm_term=CYCLIST&amp;utm_source=podcast&amp;utm_medium=Media&amp;utm_campaign=CyclistMagazine&amp;utm_content=date20250424A3Launch\" target=\"_blank\">Insta360</a>, the 360-degree filming action camera specialists.

This year marks 40 years and countless millions more raised since that walk, so to celebrate – and to raise more money – Wiggo and Beefy will be riding from Portsmouth to Lord’s Cricket Ground on 15th and 16th September and they invite you to come along too (see the link above, or go to <a href=\"https://www.beefysfoundation.org/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">beefysfoundation.org</a>). Prices start from £150 to ride, or sign up to the whole shebang including hotels, a Q&amp;A with Wiggo and Beefy at the end of day one and a sit down dinner with the guys in the Long Room at Lord’s Cricket Ground on day two. All money raised will go to Blood Cancer UK, Breakthrough Type 1 (diabetes), Yorkshires Brain Tumour Charity and the Batten Disease Family Association CIO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Did you know Cyclist is
