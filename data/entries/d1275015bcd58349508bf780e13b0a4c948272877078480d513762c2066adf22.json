{"title":"Rolling Stone: ‘How Dommes Are Convincing Submissives to Get Jabs’","link":"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/bdsm-dommes-subs-vaccination-covid19-1201121/","date":1627741727000,"content":"\n<p>E.J. Dickson, reporting for Rolling Stone:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“I think I had the same reservations that many people had,” Bob, who requested that his last name be withheld to protect his privacy, tells Rolling Stone.</p>\n\n<p>Then Bob saw a tweet from Goddess Alexandra Snow, a professional dominatrix and dungeon owner who operates Wicked Eden, a BDSM collective based in Columbus, Ohio. The tweet stated that any submissives who wanted to session with Snow in person would have to show proof of vaccination. Bob had been subscribing to Goddess Snow’s OnlyFans and “tributing” her (giving her money) for almost two years, and he got in touch with her to discuss whether or not he should get the vaccine. “It was less about convincing me and more about her confirming to me that it was the right thing to do,” he says. He got his final shot three weeks ago. “It [feels] good to know that I’m (hopefully) contributing to others not falling seriously ill,” he says. “And of course, it’s gratifying to know I’ve done something that Goddess Snow approves of.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>More like this, please.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/31/rolling-stone-dommes\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d1275015bcd58349508bf780e13b0a4c948272877078480d513762c2066adf22","category":"Tech"}
