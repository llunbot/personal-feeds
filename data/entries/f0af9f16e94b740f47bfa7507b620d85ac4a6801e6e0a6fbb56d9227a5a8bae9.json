This is something that was first introduced on Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670776/apple-pro-display-xdr-release-date-price-specs.html\">Pro Display XDR</a>, before coming to other Apple products beginning with the long-discontinued 27-inch iMac. So, what is it, and should you spend hundreds more to have it adorn your screen?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is nano-texture glass?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Glare is often a problem in brightly lit offices and homes, which can render the large, glossy displays little more than hugely elaborate mirrors. One option it to choose a display with a coating to give it a matte finish, but that is not without disadvantages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s solution to the problem is nano-texture glass, which drastically reduces glare while avoiding the frostiness and washed-out colors that are often the compromise made when opting for a matte finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s all thanks to some clever design and a meticulous process that results in displays that can happily cope with bright light sources. The nano-texture glass surface is etched in such a way as to scatter the light that falls on it so that the image quality isn’t affected and the user experiences no glare and reflections. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How does nano-texture glass work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main causes of glare is light from lamps, windows, and other sources reflecting back at you due to the smooth surfaces of modern displays. Matte finishes combat this by having some kind of coating on the display which diffuses or breaks down the light due to its more angular surface. Sadly, this works both ways, so the light emanating from the display itself is also altered, resulting in the murkier results that usually accompany the technique.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has taken things to the next level by foregoing a coating and instead physically altering the surface itself through tiny (nano) etchings. The pattern of the etchings means that light rays hitting the display are reflected off at a range of angles, eradicating most of the glare in the process.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3794587/what-is-nano-texture-and-do-i-need-it-reflect_thumb.png\" alt=\"What is nano texture and do i need it: Nano-texture Glass\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The very clever part is that this somehow doesn’t seem to have much of an effect on the onscreen display. Of course, making all those microscopic etches in the glass is a precision job, which is why it costs more. For example, to get nano-texture glass on the iMac, you’ll need to get a higher-end model and pay an additional $200, while the cost for the M4 MacBook Pro is $150 and the M4 iPad Pro is $100 more than the standard glass (though it’s only available with 1TB or 2TB of storage).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How can I clean nano-texture glass?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the quirks of Apple’s new Nano-texture glass display is that the company insists it should only be cleaned using <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MW693AM-A-Polishing-Cloth/dp/B0D1WZKDKC/\">a specific Apple cloth</a>. One is included with every display, but we’re not entirely sure what magic ingredients make it such a special piece of fabric. in a scratch test performed by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVwD_4WJS8c\">YourTube channel JerryRigEverything</a>, scratches appeared with little effort on the nano-texture glass and began to file down “like a cheese grater on cheese” with less pressure than regular glass. He also found that regular cloths and paper towels performed well when cleaning the glass.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you’ve just forked out a couple hundred bucks for a high-end display technology, it’s probably a good idea to follow Apple’s instructions and spend a little extra on a high-quality cloth.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>How durable is nano-texture glass?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nano-texture glass is as durable as standard glass. Since it doesn’t have a coating, there shouldn’t be any noticeable wear from regular use, however as noted by JerryRigEverything’s testing above, it does scratch easier than normal glass. His testing found that some objects that left no markings on regular glass created permanent marks on the nano-texture glass.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which Apple devices have nano-texture glass options? </h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPad Pro </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The nano-texture glass is available with the 1TB and 2TB iPad Pro models, for an additional $100/£100 on the usual price. </p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro/11-inch-display-1tb-space-black-wifi-nano-texture-glass\" target=\"_blank\">Buy from Apple US</a></div>\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3JB2JP5\" target=\"_blank\">Save money at Amazon US</a></div>\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro/11-inch-display-1tb-space-black-wifi-nano-texture-glass\" target=\"_blank\">Buy from Apple UK</a></div>\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-inch-Nano-texture/dp/B0D3J6GGLF\" target=\"_blank\">Save money at Amazon UK</a></div>\n\n\n<h2>MacBook Pro</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The nano-texture glass is available with all MacBook Pro models, for an additional $150/£150 on the usual price.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro\" target=\"_blank\">Buy from Apple US</a></div>\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro\" target=\"_blank\">Buy from Apple UK</a></div>\n\n\n<h2>iMac</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The nano-texture glass is available with all but the cheapest iMac model.

You will lose some contrast at certain angles, but if you’re consistently struggling to see your screen in bright light, or need to be absolutely confident that colors appear accurately, it will definitely be worth the money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f0af9f16e94b740f47bfa7507b620d85ac4a6801e6e0a6fbb56d9227a5a8bae9","category":"Apple"}
