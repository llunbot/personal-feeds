A mostly incremental upgrade over the original RX 6600 but with many of the new features from the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/review-amds-radeon-rx-7900-gpus-are-great-4k-gaming-gpus-with-caveats/\">RX 7900 XTX and XT</a>, it would come with a price cut, from the RX 6600's $329 to $299. Nvidia then briefed the press on its new mainstream RTX 4060 series. The prices for the higher-end 8GB and 16GB RTX 4060 Ti are already set at $399 and $499. The price for the lower-end RTX 4060 was left undisclosed.</p>\n<p>A few days later, presumably having caught wind of AMD's pricing plan for the RX 7600, Nvidia <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/nvidias-399-4060-ti-comes-with-no-price-hike-but-mild-performance-improvements/\">announced the price for the RTX 4060</a>: also a surprisingly low $299. (This entire time, review embargoes and briefings have been shifting by a few days here and there as the companies maneuver around each other.) Then, around 36 hours before this article was published, a new update came from AMD: The RX 7600 will now be launching for $269, $30 less than the RTX 4060 and $50 less than the old RX 6600.</p>\n\n<p>This is what competition in the mid-range GPU market looks like after a years-long cryptocurrency-and-scalper-fueled shortage and many more months of Nvidia and AMD focusing on their pricey flagships. These are new, modern cards with modern features available at a price that can at least be called \"literally affordable\" even if they aren't quite \"budget.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941045#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941045&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b707d64a6d4464fe2f6a127b28fa42a7380d70459c75ba0a5be30bbf50d46d26","category":"Tech"}
