While the AirTag has not received any hardware updates since then, a new version of the item tracking accessory is in development, according to a recent report.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/airtag-purple.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nBelow, we recap rumors about a second-generation AirTag.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Timing</h2>\r<br />\nA new AirTag is one of many new products that Apple aims to announce in the first half of 2025, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-06/when-will-apple-intelligence-be-released-when-is-apple-releasing-m4-macs-ipad-m1xksx7q\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFrom his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-06/when-will-apple-intelligence-be-released-when-is-apple-releasing-m4-macs-ipad-m1xksx7q\"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> on Sunday:<blockquote>I expect Apple to kick off 2025 with several other new devices in the first half of the year:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n- 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with M4 (J613 and J615).\r<br />\n- Revamped iPhone SE (V59).\r<br />\n- Refreshed 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Air models (J607 and J637).\r<br />\n- New Magic Keyboards for the updated iPad Air line (R307 and R308).\r<br />\n- An upgraded AirTag item finder accessory (B589).</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHe did not provide any specific details about the new AirTag in the newsletter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn October 2023, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said mass production of the second-generation AirTag had been postponed from the fourth quarter of 2024 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/airtag-2-postponed-until-2025/\">until some point in 2025</a>, but he did not provide a reason for the apparent change in plans. Kuo and Gurman are thus in agreement that a new AirTag is coming next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Features</h2>\r<br />\nGurman previously said the new AirTag would feature an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/19/airtag-with-new-chip-due-next-year/\">upgraded chip with improved location tracking</a>. If so, the AirTag could be updated with the second-generation Ultra Wideband chip that debuted in all iPhone 15 models last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo believes the new AirTag will have some kind of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/kuo-new-airtag-production-late-2024/\">integration with Apple's Vision Pro headset</a>, but he has not shared any specific details.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo design changes have been rumored for the AirTag so far.
