Instead he could be seen promoting his dedication to turning Israel into a tech leader—and possibly even signal that Musk may consider investing in the country's tech, the Times reported.</p>\n<p>The livestreamed event started with a one-on-one between Musk and Netanyahu that attracted more than 735,000 views. While much of the one-on-one focused on AI—which Musk claimed was \"potentially the biggest civilizational threat\" and Netanyahu called \"a blessing and a curse\"—the men also discussed their views on antisemitism and how Musk deals with hate speech on X.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969096#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969096&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"399f6c5d01ec44f67b01774521d374e5631d0d4d60997f288d4b117d5068f469","category":"Tech"}
