Is it because you\nwere monkeying with the code without understanding it? Is it\nbecause you <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-30/twitter-blocks-people-from-seeing-tweets-unless-registered\">tried to stop</a> people from reading the site\nwithout logging in, and <a href=\"https://www.dexerto.com/tech/twitter-users-claim-elon-musks-recent-changes-may-be-self-ddosing-the-platform-2196413/\">messed up</a> and stopped them from\nreading the site even when they logged in? Is it because you fired\nand <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-ceo-linda-yaccarino-tries-boosting-morale-with-tea-time-2023-6\">demoralized</a> too many engineers so no one was left to\nkeep the systems running normally? Is it because you forgot to pay\nthe <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/p/twitter-stiffs-google\">cloud bills</a>? Is it because deep down you don’t like it\nwhen people read posts on our site and you want to stop them, or\nyou don’t like relying on ad revenue and want to sabotage my\nability to sell ads?” Those are all interesting questions, and I\nsuppose having the answers would help my <em>new</em> head of software\nengineering fix whatever this guy broke. But no matter what the\nanswers are, this guy’s gotta go. If you are in charge of the\nsoftware engineers at a social media site, and you make it so that\npeople can’t read the site, that’s bad.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The only way you wouldn’t fire the head of software at Twitter would be, say, if he owned the company.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/ceo-who-wasnt-in-charge\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"99f3a7608f2563a1852c72a4585de0e6cb4d70b0c6d44fb34547ded10f424d7f","category":"Tech"}
