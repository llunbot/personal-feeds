The leather industry‚Äôs impact on the environment is <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.greenmatters.com/p/impact-of-leather-industry-on-environment&amp;xcust=1-1-2062186-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">complex</a>, but methane emissions from livestock, deforestation for cattle feed production, and the release of harmful chemicals from many of the most common tanning processes are all concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was big news in itself since Apple has been making leather iPhone cases since 2013 and presumably earns a lot of money from its high-priced accessories, but newer reports suggest that the company plans to ditch leather in other areas of its business. Earlier this month reports suggested that Apple Watch bands would follow a similar path and that Apple had started clearing inventory of Hermes leather accessories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, the journalist Parker Ortolani spotted that Hermes had ‚Äúcompletely removed the Apple Watch from its website. Bands are gone too. None of them show up in search either.‚Äù (We can confirm that <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.hermes.com/us/en/category/watches/apple-watch-hermes/#%7C&amp;xcust=1-1-2062186-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">this link</a> doesn‚Äôt work anymore.) Unless this is merely the prelude to the unveiling of new products‚Äìwhich wouldn‚Äôt normally be done in such a clumsy way‚Äìthen it looks like the relationship between the companies is over, at least as far as the Apple Watch is concerned.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>üö® Herm√®s has completely removed the Apple Watch from its website.

But that‚Äôs far from the only environmentally unfriendly material that Apple uses, and the company‚Äôs silicone rubber and fluoroelastomer accessories, which are not made with recycled materials and are in turn difficult to recycle, will also be replaced by ‚Äúmore eco-friendly next-generation materials,‚Äù <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/10/apple-planning-to-discontinue-silicone-accessories/&amp;xcust=1-1-2062186-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">MacRumors</a> reports. This will affect accessories for the iPhone, the Apple Watch, and even the AirTag, which Hermes‚Äô website suggested might survive the leather cull.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, while Apple is expected to announce an abrupt end to leather accessories at the Wonderlust event, silicone rubber and fluoroelastomer may be phased out more slowly. Apple makes numerous products with silicone and replacing them all would be a major undertaking. Therefore, Macrumors reports it will be ‚Äúa more gradual transition whereby existing models are not refreshed with new color options.‚Äù</p>\n\nApple Inc</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"cdf785ae3aebebfa6406f8e71aed0192454b4d6a1774ad1e4be0a43dbfd1de93","category":"Apple"}
