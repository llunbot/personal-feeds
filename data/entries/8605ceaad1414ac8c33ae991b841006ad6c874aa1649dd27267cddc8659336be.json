featuring a 140mm fork, boost thru-axles and a choice of 27.5in or 29in wheels.</p>\n<p>This is the second bike release from Calibre since the brand emerged from pandemic hibernation and sits above the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/calibre-bikes-rake/\">Rake 29</a> in its line-up.</p>\n<p>The bike is available in two spec tiers, with the entry-level Line T2 27.5 priced at £800 (with a GO Outdoors membership card), featuring a 10-speed Shimano Deore drivetrain.</p>\n<p>The higher-level Line T3 27.5 uses an 11-speed SRAM NX drivetrain and is priced at £999 (again with a GO Outdoors membership card).</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-29er/\">29er</a> version of the Line T3 is also available, priced at £1,100, and features SRAM’s NX groupset and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-introduces-new-guide-t-disc-brakes/\">Guide T</a> brakes.</p>\n<p>Both higher-end Line T3 models also feature a KS Rage-i dropper post.</p>\n<h2>Upgradeable frame</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\"

aggressive hardtail.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Calibre</i></span></div>\n<p>The new Calibre Line models are built around a 6061 aluminium frame with full-length external cable routing for the brakes and gears.</p>\n<p>Calibre says it decided on full-length cables to reduce maintenance time and to keep the gears shifting well in wet, gritty conditions.</p>\n<p>The fame also features internal cable routing in the seat tube for the KS Rage-i <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper post</a> on the Line T3, which will allow Line T2 owners to upgrade in the future.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\"

start of the trail.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Calibre</i></span></div>\n<p>The Line features two cage mounts, with one on the down tube and the other on the underside of the crossbar towards the rear of the bike.</p>\n<p>Unlike some other bikes in its price range, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/trek-marlin-8/\">Trek Marlin 8</a>, the Calibre Line features thru-axles.</p>\n<p>Calibre says it decided to design the Line around boost thru-axles to the front and rear of the bike to add rigidity and allow for future upgrades with the vast majority of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-wheels/\">best mountain bike wheels</a> on the market using thru-axles.</p>\n<p>Both models are specced with RockShox’s FS-Recon Silver RL fork, with the Line T3 models featuring <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">140mm of suspension travel</a> and the Line T2 using a 120mm variant.</p>\n<p>All models also run on tubeless-ready wheels. These are fitted with 2.6in (2.4in on the Line T2) wide Maxxis Rekon tyres. That’s notably wide for an entry-level <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hardtail-mountain-bikes/\">hardtail mountain bike</a> and should make for a comfortable ride if you <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-set-up-a-tubeless-tyre/#:~:text=Fit%20the%20tubeless%20valve&amp;text=Start%20by%20finding%20the%20valve,cut'%20the%20hole%20to%20size.\">set them up tubeless</a>.</p>\n<h2>All-round geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Calibre Line T3 29 hardtail mountain bike\" title=\"Calibre Line T3 29 hardtail mountain bike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Calibre says the Line should be capable on 99 per cent of UK trails.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Calibre</i></span></div>\n<p>Calibre says it has designed the frame around <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/spoke-tension-is-long-slack-and-low-geometry-always-better-our-tech-experts-give-us-their-angle/\">modern mountain bike trends</a>, and has aimed to make the bike suitable for 99 per cent of UK trails.</p>\n<p>The geometry for the Line is different depending on the spec level and wheel size. The slackest is the Line T3 27.5 with a head angle of 65 degrees, then the Line T3 29 at 65.5 degrees and the base Line T2 27.5 at 66 degrees due to its shorter travel.</p>\n<p>Effective seat tube angles remain the same through all the models at 75 degrees, which Calibre says gives the bike comfortable and composed climbing.</p>\n<p>The Line is more aggressive than the Rake 29, which features a head angle of 66 degrees and a seat tube angle of 74.5 degrees.</p>\n<h2>Calibre Line spec and price</h2>\n<h3>Calibre Line T2 27</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Calibre Line T2 27.5\" title=\"Calibre Line T2 27.5\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Line T2 has 20mm less suspension than the T3 model.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Calibre</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fork:</strong> RockShox FS-Recon Silver RL, 120mm</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> Shimano Deore 10-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Shimano MT201</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Shimano HB-MT400 hub, 27.5in tubeless-ready rim</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Maxxis Rekon 27.5×2.4in</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £800</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Calibre Line T3 27</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Calibre Line T3 27 hardtail mountain bike\" title=\"Calibre Line T3 27 hardtail mountain bike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Line T3 27 uses SRAM’s Level T brakes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Calibre</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fork:</strong> RockShox FS-Recon Silver RL, 140mm</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> SRAM NX</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> SRAM Level T</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Formula hub, 27.5in tubeless-ready rim</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Maxxis Rekon 27.5×2.6in</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £999</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Calibre Line T3 29</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Calibre Line T3 29\" title=\"Calibre Line T3 29\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Line T3 comes with a KS Rage-i 125mm dropper post.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Calibre</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fork:</strong> RockShox FS-Recon Silver RL, 140mm</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> SRAM NX</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> SRAM Guide T</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Formula hub, 29in tubeless-ready rim</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Maxxis Rekon 29×2.6in</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £1,100</li>\n</ul>","author":"Nick Clark","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"8605ceaad1414ac8c33ae991b841006ad6c874aa1649dd27267cddc8659336be","category":"Cycling"}
