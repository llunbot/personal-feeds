Oxide TFT LCD panels offer better power efficiency and improved performance compared to traditional a-Si displays, resulting in sharper images, smoother scrolling, and enhanced battery life.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe transition to Oxide TFT technology should also mean faster pixel response times and more consistent brightness across the screen. In practical terms, this should translate to reduced motion blur when watching videos or gaming, and more uniform lighting without the \"clouding\" effect sometimes visible on current LCD displays.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSamsung Display and BOE are developing manufacturing capabilities for the advanced panels, according to the Korean-language report. Samsung Display is installing new deposition machines at its A6 production line, while BOE is constructing its B16 line with similar capabilities. The companies are preparing to produce millions of units annually, but the exact production targets haven't been disclosed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe LCD upgrade comes as Apple has reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/18/oled-macbook-air-reportedly-delayed/\">delayed</a> its OLED MacBook Air plans from 2027 to 2029 or later.
