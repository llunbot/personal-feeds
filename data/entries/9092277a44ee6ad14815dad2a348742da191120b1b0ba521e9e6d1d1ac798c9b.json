Motherboard makers should release new BIOS versions with these updates \"over the next few days.\"</p>\n<p>\"We recommend all users to check their motherboard manufacturer's website and update their BIOS to ensure their system has the most up to date software for their processor,\" says AMD.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933839#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933839&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9092277a44ee6ad14815dad2a348742da191120b1b0ba521e9e6d1d1ac798c9b","category":"Tech"}
