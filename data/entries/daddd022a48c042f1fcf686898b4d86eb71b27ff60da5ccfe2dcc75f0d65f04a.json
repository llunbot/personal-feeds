If you pay for Game Pass, or you see this game at any price that feels reasonable (including its debut $50), that should tell you enough about whether to try it. I think you should.</p>\n<p>I wanted to get that out of the way because I have some nits to pick with <em>Lamplighters League </em>(technically <em>The Lamplighters League and the Tower at the End of the World),</em> some technical and some tactical. But I don’t want to lose sight of how excited I am to have a meaty new tactics game to sink into, especially one based on an original, if heavily referential, world. If you’re a fan of tile-based movements, two actions per turn, home bases full of upgrade potential, and engaging little interactions between your troops, you don’t get that many solid games like this per year, so take note of <em>Lamplighters League</em> The number of years between <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&amp;cx=009773542741016272635:e6s_fsvpe7o&amp;q=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/xcom-2-war-of-the-chosen-review-a-world-worth-saving/&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiQ6-rcruKBAxXxFlkFHYjnBy0QFnoECAIQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw0r0RJuCRIXM6RUr0EhNbFk\"><em>XCOM</em> titles</a> is getting longer, not shorter—we need some reserves.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974242#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974242&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"daddd022a48c042f1fcf686898b4d86eb71b27ff60da5ccfe2dcc75f0d65f04a","category":"Tech"}
