Once classified as obsolete, the laptop will no longer be eligible for repairs or service at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers, as parts will no longer be available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/2016-12-inch-macbook-feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple classifies a product as technologically obsolete once more than seven years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. The original 12-inch MacBook was discontinued in April 2016 upon the release of a second-generation model with improved specs, so the laptop recently crossed that seven-year mark.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIntroduced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2015/03/09/apple-new-macbook-2015/\">in March 2015</a>, the 12-inch MacBook featured a thin and light design that weighed just two pounds, and it was also Apple's first fanless notebook. Pricing started at $1,299, with the original model's standard specs including a 1.1GHz dual-core Intel Core M processor, integrated Intel graphics, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKey design aspects of the 12-inch MacBook included a single USB-C port for charging and data transfer, an all-new Force Touch trackpad, and a terraced battery design that allowed for a larger battery to fit inside the notebook's thin chassis.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnfortunately, the 12-inch MacBook was also the first MacBook model to feature Apple's infamous butterfly switch keyboard design, which is prone to failure and was eventually dropped from the entire MacBook lineup after years of complaints and lawsuits. Apple last updated the 12-inch MacBook in June 2017, and it was discontinued in July 2019.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/\">Vintage and Obsolete Apple Products</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/01/12-inch-macbook-obsolete-soon/\">Apple Says Original 12-Inch MacBook Will Be Obsolete at End of June</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-original-12-inch-macbook-will-be-obsolete-at-end-of-june.2391289/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"32800c98d2592fcaf3ac4ec9c69cf9344173fddb675ffefc46d270e94a5817c8","category":"Apple"}
