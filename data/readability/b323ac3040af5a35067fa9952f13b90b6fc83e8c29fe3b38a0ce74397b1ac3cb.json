The Pogies are essentially oversized mittens that fit over your handlebars, or in this case, over the Shotgun Child Seat Handlebars. Here’s Trev Worsey and his little boy showing us the joy that is to be had… hard to know who’s having the best time really!</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZE7bSXQyUBs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><h2>Kids Ride Shotgun Pogies</h2><p>The Kids Ride Shotgun Pogies are designed to complement the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/let-your-kids-ride-shotgun-with-the-shotgun-kids-mtb-seat-handlebars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kids Ride Shotgun Child Bike Seat</a> (and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/kids-ride-shotgun-pro-child-seat-avoids-frame-contact-now-compatible-with-ebikes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pro Child Bike Seat</a>) and Handlebars, helping you and your child riding through the colder months without the risk of frost bitten fingers.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/30073803/kidsride-shotgun-pogies-on-bar.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/30073803/kidsride-shotgun-pogies-on-bar.jpg\" alt=\"kids ride shotgun pogies\" width=\"1600\" height=\"798\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/30073803/kidsride-shotgun-pogies-on-bar.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/30073803/kidsride-shotgun-pogies-on-bar-297x148.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/30073803/kidsride-shotgun-pogies-on-bar-800x399.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/30073803/kidsride-shotgun-pogies-on-bar-120x60.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/30073803/kidsride-shotgun-pogies-on-bar-768x383.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/30073803/kidsride-shotgun-pogies-on-bar-1536x766.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>Between the Ripstop Polyester outer fabric and the inner fleece liner sits a 3M Thinsulate material gives the Pogies an insulation temperature rated to -22°F (-30°C). The outer fabric is waterproof to 10,000mm with sealed seams throughout, with a breathability rating of 5000gm. The Pogies have wide cuffs to allow gloves and puffy jacket sleeves to fit inside. The structure is rigid so the Pogies will stay open to allow easy access for little hands.</p><p>To attach the Pogies to the bar, you simply wrap the bottom flap of the Pogies underneath the bar, and then secure the top flap over the top of the bar using the velcro. You can fit these onto regular flat handlebars if your child’s cockpit setup doesn’t run the Shotgun Child Seat Handlebars.</p><h3>Pricing &amp; Availability</h3><p>The Kids Ride Shotgun Pogies are available in one size only, recommended for children aged 2-5 years. Pick up a pair for $55 USD.</p><p><a href=\"https://kidsrideshotgun.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>KidsRideShotgun.com</em></a></p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Jessie-May Morgan","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b323ac3040af5a35067fa9952f13b90b6fc83e8c29fe3b38a0ce74397b1ac3cb","category":"Cycling"}
