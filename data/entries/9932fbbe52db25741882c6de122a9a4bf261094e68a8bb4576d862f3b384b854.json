The Pangolin and its native Pop!_OS are a showcase for how remarkably normal Linux can feel as a daily driver in 2023. Normal, and with lots of ports.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Specs at a glance: System76 Pangolin (2023)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Display</th>\n<td>15.6-inch 1920×1080 144 Hz, matte, non-touch</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>OS</th>\n<td>Pop!_OS 22.04 or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>CPU</th>\n<td>AMD Ryzen 7 6800U, 2.7-4.7 GHz, 8 cores, 16 threads</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>RAM</th>\n<td>32GB LPDDR5 (up to 5500 MHz)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>GPU</th>\n<td>AMD Radeon 680M (integrated)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Storage</th>\n<td>Two M.2 PCIe NVMe slots, 16TB total capacity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Networking</th>\n<td>Gigabit Ethernet, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Battery</th>\n<td>70 Wh</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Ports</th>\n<td>Power (barrel), HDMI, USB-A-type (x3), USB-C (power and data), headphone, ethernet, SD, Kensington lock.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Size</th>\n<td>14.59× 9.76×0.71 inches (37.06×24.79×1.80 cm)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Weight</th>\n<td>3.95 lbs (1.79 kg)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Warranty</th>\n<td>1-year (extendable to 3)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Price as reviewed</th>\n<td>$1,414 ($1,300 base)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>It’s hard to do a nuts-and-bolts comparison of the Pangolin to most other laptops, due largely to benchmark comparability between Linux and most laptops running Windows or macOS. But it’s also not entirely necessary. There’s only one real version of the Pangolin available—one processor, one amount of RAM, then variable, user-expandable storage.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928262#p3\">Read 44 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928262&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9932fbbe52db25741882c6de122a9a4bf261094e68a8bb4576d862f3b384b854","category":"Tech"}
