Priced at $100, the Juice Pack is designed to add additional battery life to Apple's latest <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/mophie-juice-pack-iphone-15.jpg\" width=\"1671\" height=\"940\" />\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 15‌ case has a 2,400 mAh battery, while the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ model has a 2,600 mAh battery. The ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ version has a larger 2,800 mAh battery. At this capacity, the cases won't provide a full charge for any of the ‌iPhone 15‌ models, but they will provide a partial charge for long days of ‌iPhone‌ usage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen connected to a USB-C charger, the case will direct power to the ‌iPhone‌ first, and when the ‌iPhone‌'s battery is full, the case itself will charge. Mophie says that ergonomics and design were taken into account with the Juice Pack, leading to its soft-touch exterior. Raised corners and a high impact protection system are designed to protect the ‌iPhone‌ from scratches and cracks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMophie plans to accept pre-orders for the new Juice Pack options starting in February.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMophie also provided launch details for its first Qi2 devices, which were <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/01/mophie-unveils-qi2-accessories/\">announced back in September</a>.
