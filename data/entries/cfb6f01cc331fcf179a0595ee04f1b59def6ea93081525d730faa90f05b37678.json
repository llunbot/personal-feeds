However, last year’s race was considered a big improvement from previous iterations, with Elisa Longo Borghini winning the prestigious pink jersey. RSC will continue to run the Giro d’Italia Women in 2025, and the route unveiling in Rome this week proves that the organisers want to continue growing the race. </p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>This year's race will take place July 6 to 13, with eight stages overall. The entire route totals 939.6km and climbs 14,000 metres of elevation (a 1,000m increase from 2024) across one individual time trial, two flat stages, three medium mountain stages and two high mountain stages. As the week goes on, the route ramps up, and the general classification fight will heat up as the race nears the end of the eight stages, with the queen stage on the penultimate day of the race. </span></p>\n<div><img alt=\"Rouleur Giro d'Italia Women\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GW25_gen_plan_1024x1024.jpg?v=1736866524\" /></div>\n<p><span>Like the 2024 edition of the race, the riders will start with a test against the clock with an individual time trial around Bergamo, opening the Giro. General classification riders will be able to secure an early lead but will need to be vigilant as the following stage could spark potential threats, as could crossing the Passo del Tonale in stage three, despite being an opportunity for the sprinters. A summit finish in Pianezze, a pan-flat day, and a lumpy stage into the Romagna Apennines take the women’s route north before the most challenging stage of the race. Stage seven will conclude on the Monte Nerone, a new climb for the </span><span>Corsa Rosa</span><span>. But the GC standings could possibly still be all to play for, with a demanding circuit stage featuring over 2,000 metres of climbing, closing the race in Imola. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Stage one: Bergamo to Bergamo - 13.6km (individual time trial)</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Sunday, July 6, 2025</em></p>\n<div><img alt=\"Rouleur Giro d'Italia Women\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GW25_T01_ITT_alt_1024x1024.jpg?v=1736866186\" /></div>\n<p><span>The opening stage of the Giro d’Italia Women is a race against the clock, with an individual time trial around the city. There is little elevation but a few tight bends between the flat stretches for the riders to contend with. Nonetheless, this will give the ITT specialists a chance at victory, while also setting the stage for general classification riders. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Stage two: Clusone to Aprica - 99km</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Monday, July 7, 2025 </em></p>\n<div><img alt=\"Rouleur Giro d'Italia Women\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GW25_T02_alt_1024x1024.jpg?v=1736866225\" /></div>\n<p><span>Stage two welcomes the first categorised climb of the race, and it is at the end of the second stage. However, this climb to Aprica is not too difficult and is at the end of a relatively straightforward stage from Clusone. It’s most likely that the winner of this type of stage will be from an escape on the final ramps to the finish. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Stage three: Vezza d’Oglio to Trento - 124km </strong></h3>\n<p><em>Tuesday, July 8, 2025 </em></p>\n<div><img alt=\"Rouleur Giro d'Italia Women\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GW25_T03_alt_1024x1024.jpg?v=1736866289\" /></div>\n<p><span>Sprinters will finally get their chance at victory on stage three, as after the category one Passo del Tonale, the route descends for almost 40km through Val di Sole and Val di Non. Once they’ve reached Mezzolombardo, the route heads towards Trento, where a flat run into the finish will result in a bunch sprint. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Stage four: Castello Tesino to Pianezze - 156km</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Wednesday, July 9, 2025</em></p>\n<div><img alt=\"Rouleur Giro d'Italia Women\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GW25_T04_alt_1024x1024.jpg?v=1736866350\" /></div>\n<p><span>Stage four is where the race ramps up with a relentless day of ups and downs, plus a summit finish to Pianezze. While there are only four categorised climbs across the 156km-long route, the continual undulations of the day will wear the rider's legs down. By the time they reach the summit finish, it will be riders who can best combine endurance, climbing ability and tactical nous that will shine, with breakaway artists viewing this stage as an opportunity to make their mark. Those teams with a GC rider will also need to carefully manage their resources and ensure their leader is well-positioned for the finale in case of potential threats to their position on the GC. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Stage five: Mirano to Monselive - 108km </strong></h3>\n<p><em>Thursday, July 10, 2025</em></p>\n<div><img alt=\"Rouleur Giro d'Italia Women\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GW25_T05_alt_1024x1024.jpg?v=1736866370\" /></div>\n<p><span>A prime opportunity for the sprinters awaits on stage five, with an entirely flat route from Mirano to Monselive. This stage will also be a chance for the GC riders to relax before a tough final three days. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Stage six: Bellaria-Igea Marina to Terre Roveresche - 144km </strong></h3>\n<p><em>Friday, July 11, 2025 </em></p>\n<div><img alt=\"Rouleur Giro d'Italia Women\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GW25_T06_alt_1024x1024.jpg?v=1736866389\" /></div>\n<p><span>This is the first of three tough stages that will see the women’s peloton head into the Romagna Apennines, ascending San Marino, Monteciccardo, and Beato Sante before a number of uncategorised hills that will take the riders to a 15km circuit which will see them climb to Terre Roversche for the finish. This will be another opportunity for the breakaway to try and stay away. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Stage seven: Fermignano to Monte Nerone - 157km </strong></h3>\n<p><em>Saturday, July 12, 2025</em></p>\n<div><img alt=\"Rouleur Giro d'Italia Women\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GW25_T07_Nerone_alt_1024x1024.jpg?v=1736866407\" /></div>\n<p><span>The penultimate stage of the race also sees the queen stage – a chance for those vying for the overall to make a change to their current position in the GC standings. From the very start, the riders will have to tackle a number of uncategorised climbs before reaching their first official climb of the day, Moria. This is quickly followed by Passo la Croce and Valico de Croce Avellana. While these are challenging ascents, it is the summit finish where the battle will begin with the climb to the summit of Monte Nerone averaging over 8%. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Stage eight: Forlì to Imola - 138km</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Sunday, July 13, 2025</em></p>\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GW25_T08_alt_1024x1024.jpg?v=1736866426\" /></div>\n<p><span>The final stage of the Giro d’Italia Women will see the riders take on the 2020 UCI World Championship road race circuit, where Anna van der Breggen took the title. The circuit will be completed four times and include two climbs – Cima Gallisterna and Mazzolano – before finishing inside the Autodromo Enzo and Dino Ferrari in Imola. If time gaps are small following the summit finish on the previous stage, the rider in pink will need to keep their wits about them to ensure no late changes of the Maglia Rosa.</span></p>\n<p><span>\n<em>Map and stage profiles courtesy of RCS Sport</em></span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p> </p>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"cfb6f01cc331fcf179a0595ee04f1b59def6ea93081525d730faa90f05b37678","category":"Cycling"}
