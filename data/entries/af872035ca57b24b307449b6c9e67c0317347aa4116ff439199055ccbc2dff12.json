A few of them will be familiar to Apple\nplatform users: subject selection uses machine learning to let\nyou quickly isolate and grab the subject of a picture (there’s\nalso a corresponding “Remove Background” feature to simplify\nthat task) and a Live Text tool allows you to select and copy\ntext within an image.</p>\n\n<p>For me, the star of the show is the fascinating Data Merge, which\nis a bit like Mail Merge for images. If you’ve ever needed to\ncreate the same image several times but with different information — nametags, for example, or personalized gift cards — this is a\nlife-saver. You open your template image, identify your variables,\nthen hand Acorn a CSV file with the relevant data and it will\nprocess through them, assigning text where needed and even putting\nimages in assigned layers. It’s the kind of wild automation tool\nthat might not be something you need <em>every</em> day, but when you do\nneed it, there’s really no replacement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The rare sweet spot that Acorn hits is that it’s super-approachable to new and casual users, who just need an image editor sometimes, and super-powerful for power users who want to dig in.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/18/dan-moren-acorn-8\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"af872035ca57b24b307449b6c9e67c0317347aa4116ff439199055ccbc2dff12","category":"Tech"}
