The all-new Ridley Noah Fast uses the UCI’s updated 8:1 Rule for maximum aero tube shapes. They updated the geometry and gave it a 36cm wide integrated cockpit, and it can fit up to 34mm tires. Is this the new norm for Aero bikes?  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-hero-.webp\"><img width=\"2084\" height=\"1388\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-hero-.webp\" alt=\"Ridley-Noah-Fast-hero\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-hero-.webp 2084w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-hero--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-hero--1536x1023.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-hero--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-hero--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-hero--2048x1364.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-hero--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-hero--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>All Photos: Ridley</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What’s New? Ridley Noah Fast</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ridley claims its new Noah Fast is the fastest bike it has ever produced, boasting 8.5-watt savings over its predecessor at a blistering 50kph World Tour pace. Unveiled after months of speculation, the redesigned aero bike brings cutting-edge features and a fresh design inspired by recent UCI rule changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ridley’s 2025 design philosophy is simple: “Aerodynamics is everything.” (<em>where have I heard that before?</em>). Leveraging its in-house wind tunnel and the latest UCI regulations, Ridley has created a bike that’s faster, stiffer, and more integrated than ever before.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-re-desigh-.webp\"><img width=\"1760\" height=\"1162\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-re-desigh-.webp\" alt=\"Ridley-Noah-Fast-re-desigh\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-re-desigh-.webp 1760w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-re-desigh--297x196.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-re-desigh--1536x1014.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-re-desigh--120x79.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-re-desigh--768x507.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Redefining Aero with UCI’s 8:1 Rule</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The most notable change shaping the Noah Fast is Ridley’s embrace of UCI’s updated 8:1 tube ratio rule. Previously, the UCI restricted tube dimensions to a 3:1 ratio, limiting aero optimization. However, with the rule change in 2023, Ridley has drawn inspiration from its Dean Fast time trial bike, implementing longer, narrower tube profiles in the fork, seat stays, and down tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-intro-.webp\"><img width=\"1998\" height=\"1048\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-intro-.webp\" alt=\"Ridley-Noah-Fast-intro\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-intro-.webp 1998w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-intro--297x156.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-intro--1536x806.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-intro--120x63.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-intro--768x403.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ridley-bikes.com/en_US/news/article/104262\">Check the full details from Ridley on how the new Noah Fast was conceived </a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The oversized down tube is precisely shaped to manage airflow around water bottles. The elongated head tube takes full advantage of UCI compensation triangles for improved aerodynamics. These refinements make the Noah Fast 8.5 watts faster than its predecessor and 7 watts quicker than Ridley’s all-rounder, the Falcn RC.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-stem-stack-.webp\"><img width=\"738\" height=\"472\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-stem-stack-.webp\" alt=\"Ridley-Noah-Fast-stem-stack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-stem-stack-.webp 738w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-stem-stack--297x190.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-stem-stack--120x77.webp 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Cockpit Innovation | Aero Integration</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Noah Fast introduces a fully integrated cockpit, aligning with Ridley’s focus on combining aerodynamic gains with rider comfort. The Nimbus Aero cockpit features a strikingly narrow 36cm handlebar width at the shifters, optimized for an aggressive, aerodynamic position.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-bars-.webp\"><img width=\"1104\" height=\"772\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-bars-.webp\" alt=\"Ridley-Noah-Fast-bars\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-bars-.webp 1104w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-bars--297x208.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-bars--120x84.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-bars--768x537.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ridley’s design integrates the cockpit into the top tube, hoping to reduce turbulence compared to traditional setups. Flared handlebars enhance handling, while inward-angled shifters comply with UCI regulations while maintaining a sleek profile. The bar is aggressive on paper but very on trend for the pointy end of the world tour, looking for every advantage. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-on-the-road-.webp\"><img width=\"2082\" height=\"1388\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-on-the-road-.webp\" alt=\"Ridley-Noah-Fast-on-the-road\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-on-the-road-.webp 2082w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-on-the-road--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-on-the-road--1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-on-the-road--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-on-the-road--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-on-the-road--2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-on-the-road--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-on-the-road--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Steeper Geometry</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A steeper 76-degree seat tube angle sets the Noah Fast apart from typical road race bikes. Ridley says this geometry reflects the growing preference for forward bike fits among pro riders. A fit that helps improve hip angle and power transfer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-Geo-.webp\"><img width=\"2416\" height=\"1166\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-Geo-.webp\" alt=\"Ridley-Noah-Fast-Geo-\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-Geo-.webp 2416w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-Geo--297x143.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-Geo--1536x741.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-Geo--120x58.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-Geo--768x371.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-Geo--2048x988.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Ridley Noah Fast Geometry  </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Noah Fast is available in five sizes: XXS, XS, S, M, and L.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the bike accommodates 34mm tires for improved comfort and grip, while a lower bottom bracket compensates for the increased tire volume. The lower head tube complements the integrated cockpit for a more aggressive aero position.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-Purple-.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1307\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-Purple--1536x1307.webp\" alt=\"Ridley-Noah-Fast-Purple\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-Purple--1536x1307.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-Purple--297x253.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-Purple--120x102.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-Purple--768x653.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-Purple-.webp 1660w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-red-3.0-.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1301\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-red-3.0--1536x1301.webp\" alt=\"Ridley-Noah-Fast-red-3.0\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-red-3.0--1536x1301.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-red-3.0--297x252.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-red-3.0--120x102.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-red-3.0--768x651.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ridley-Noah-Fast-red-3.0-.webp 1674w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Two Fast Models</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Noah Fast is available in five sizes, starting at €5,499 for a frameset and €8,799 for a complete Shimano Ultegra build. Riders looking for similar aero advantages at a lower price point can opt for the new Noah aero bike., which retains the same geometry but features a different carbon lay-up and cockpit design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ridley-bikes.com/en_US/bikes/SBINF3RID082\">Ridley-bikes.com</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ridley-noah-fast-aero-road-bike-8-to-1/\">Ridley’s New Noah Fast is the Belgian Brand’s Fastest Bike Ever</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"16469f03fbef1c5b0680d5ad244ca2bd7bba04bf208f4acde0e83cf60955ae10","category":"Cycling"}
