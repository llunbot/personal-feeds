The on-ear headphones have been re-engineered inside and out to deliver upgraded performance and fit while featuring even longer battery life compared to the previous generation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\nOn the acoustic front, Beats Solo 4 feature custom-built 40 mm transducers specifically tuned for music and designed to minimize artifacts and distortion, and the on Apple devices the headphones support Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking to immerse you in your audio environment while keeping the sound source anchored to your device as you move around.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUpgraded digital beam-forming microphones and an intelligent noise-learning algorithm trained in over 7,000 hours of exposure to real-world environments help deliver excellent call quality and voice assistant performance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/beats-solo-4-colors.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nBeats Solo 4 support three different modes of connection: wirelessly over Bluetooth, wired over USB-C, and wired over a 3.5mm audio connector. Most users will likely opt for wireless connectivity for convenience, but connecting over USB-C offers support for lossless audio and the ability to charge the headphones while listening, while the 3.5mm jack offers a simple connection method for battery-free listening.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you're connecting wirelessly, Beats Solo 4 will deliver up to 50 hours of playback, up from 40 hours in the previous generation, while you can take up to 36 hours of phone calls on a single charge. A 10-minute Fast Fuel charge will give you up to five hours of playback time if you're low on battery.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/beats-solo-4-blue-basketball.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nActive noise cancelation (ANC) is not included on Beats Solo 4, but the on-ear design offers fairly solid passive noise isolation in our testing, keeping even rather loud environmental sounds from intruding much on our listening experience.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBeats Solo 4 include a proprietary Beats chip platform to support both iOS and Android with one-touch pairing, automatic setup across devices, and support for Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a> and Android's ‌Find My‌ Device services. iOS users also get access to always-on \"Hey <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>\" functionality and support for Audio Sharing. The iconic Beats 'b\" button on the ear cups can be configured for music and phone call controls and voice assistant activation, while volume can be controlled by pressing above or below the \"b\" button.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/beats-solo-4-pink-ipad.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nOverall, Beats Solo 4 retain the same iconic design that has led to over 40 million units sold since the introduction of the original Beats Solo headphones in 2009. Offering a more compact form factor and a cheaper price point than the over-ear Beats Studio Pro, Beats Solo 4 weigh just 217 grams while delivering a comfortable fit thanks to durable UltraPlush ear cushions, infinite-rotation gimbals on the ergonomically angled ear cups, and a flex-grip headband with customizable sliders. We did notice a bit of ear fatigue due to the on-ear design, but adjusting the headphones slightly definitely helped extend our listening session with out too much discomfort.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/beats-solo-4-pink-case.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThe case design is essentially the same as that for the Beats Studio Pro, which may not appeal to all users. It's a compact nylon case with a low-profile carrying/attachment loop and a side zipper, and the interior features a main compartment for the headphones and two small pockets for the included USB-C to USB-C and 3.5mm to 3.5mm cables. As with the slightly larger Studio Pro case, it can be a bit difficult to get the headphones in and out of the case.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBeats Solo 4 come in Matte Black, Slate Blue, and Cloud Pink color options and are available to order starting today from apple.com for $199.99 ahead of a May 2 shipping date.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/\">Beats</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-4-launch/\">Beats Solo 4 Headphones Debut With Improved Acoustics, Longer Battery Life, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beats-solo-4-headphones-debut-with-improved-acoustics-longer-battery-life-and-more.2425191/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3a4a4ec2df0aafce9ba495805a6a4620c6eba343d254ced58432844a1ce71365","category":"Apple"}
