If you want to pack up supplies and gear for every conceivable contingency, you’re going to need a lot of those kilograms.</p>\n<p>But what if you skipped almost all that weight and only took a do-it-all Swiss Army knife instead? That’s exactly what scientists at NASA Ames Research Center and Stanford University are testing with robots, algorithms, and highly advanced building materials.</p>\n<h2>Zero mass exploration</h2>\n<p>“The concept of zero mass exploration is rooted in self-replicating machines, an engineering concept John von Neumann conceived in the 1940s”, says Kenneth C. Cheung, a NASA Ames researcher. He was involved in the new study published recently in <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adi2746\">Science Robotics</a> covering self-reprogrammable metamaterials—materials that do not exist in nature and have the ability to change their configuration on their own. “It’s the idea that an engineering system can not only replicate, but sustain itself in the environment,” he adds.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002047#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002047&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6fbf365937a77314577d0f79620aef32b9db9562e0e83ff89b507238dcc77919","category":"Tech"}
