WhatsApp has announced that it will be dropping support for all iPhones running anything older than iOS 15.1, removing several models currently compatible with the service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-to-drop-support-for-older-ios-versions-and-iphone-models-starting-may-2025/\">WABetaInfo</a>, WhatsApp will drop support for the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus, all of which <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1811287/which-version-of-ios-can-my-iphone-run.html\">haven’t been officially supported</a> with iOS updates since iOS 12. The current version of WhatsApp supports iPhones running iOS 12 or later, which includes these models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though WhatsApp is dropping three iOS versions with the jump to iOS 15.1, it only affects those three phone models since iOS 13, 14, and 15 supported the same phones. When WhatsApp drops support for iOS 15, however, it will lose five more phones: the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and the original iPhone SE. If it jumps to iOS 17, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, and iPhone X will be gone too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re using one of the doomed handsets and want to keep enjoying WhatsApp, check out our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670458/iphone-buying-guide.html\">iPhone buying guide</a> to find the right upgrade model, and then grab a bargain with our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672801/best-iphone-deals.html\">best iPhone deals</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e12689a35fb3e4435fd3108010fe9b8e15b7b5066bbb3beb87f71d6abbd2ff6c","category":"Apple"}
