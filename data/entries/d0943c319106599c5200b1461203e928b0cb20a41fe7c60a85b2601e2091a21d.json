With winding roads, passionate spectators flying flags and cheering for the riders, and epic battles unfolding, these stages make for the most exhilarating and decisive days in the Tour.  The recent trio of back-to-back mountains stages in the Alps was a true spectacle of action. </p>\n<p>Throughout the stages, we witnessed remarkable performances from stage winners Michal Kwiatkowski (Ineos Grenadiers), Carlos Rodríguez (Ineos Grenadiers) and Wout Poels (Bahrain-Victorious). Meanwhile, just behind these victorious winners, an intense battle for yellow ensured, with Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) managing to maintain his 10 second lead over rival Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates). </p>\n<p><em>Rouleur</em> photojournalist James Startt has been at this year's Tour de France capturing all the action from the mountains.  </p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/01stg14_vingegaard01_tdf_2023.jpg?v=1689534964\" alt /></span><span>All eyes were on Jonas Vingegaard as he rolled to the start of stage 14 for the first Alpine stage of this year’s Tour.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/02stg14_fans01_tdf_2023.jpg?v=1689534983\" alt />Crowds wait in anticipation for the race to attack one of the early climbs of the day.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/03stg14_van_aert01_tdf_2023.jpg?v=1689535005\" alt /></span>Jumbo-Visma drove the race throughout the day, and it surprised no one to see all-around strongman Wout Van Aert powering the pace at the front through several climbs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/04stg14_pogacar02_tdf_2023.jpg?v=1689535034\" alt />Tadej Pogačar tries to cool down in the opening pitches of the much-anticipated Col de la Joux Plane.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/05stg14_pinoto02_tdf_2023.jpg?v=1689535060\" alt /></span><span>The ever-popular Thibaut Pinot, once again made the break on stage 14, but he came up short in his search for a final stage win in the Tour before retiring at the end of the season.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/06stg14_pogacar04_tdf_2023.jpg?v=1689535091\" alt />Pogčar on the front as he crests the Joux Plane after his attack on the summit was thwarted by a television and photo moto.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/07stg15_pogacar_start01_tdf_2023.jpg?v=1689535117\" alt /></span><span>Tadej Pogačar steps off the team bus before the start of stage 15 with an arm-full of signed white jerseys to throw to his awaiting fans.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/08stg15_crash_girmay01_tdf_2023.jpg?v=1689535139\" alt /></span><span>As in stage 14, a massive crash compromised the early kilometers of stage 15 as well.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/09stg15_petit02_tdf_2023.jpg?v=1689535169\" alt /></span><span>After crashing hard on stage 14, Frenchman Adrien Petit struggles in the opening kilometers of stage 15.
