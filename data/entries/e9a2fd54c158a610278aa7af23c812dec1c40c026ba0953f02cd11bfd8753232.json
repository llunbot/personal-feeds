It’s so nice seeing all of the talent and unique touches made to the frame designs. Well, along these lines is another tribute to the lil’ guy, the Master Bike Builders Show (MBBS) being held in Bentonville, Arkansas in September on Saturday the 16th, and Sunday the 17th. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/podcast-052-why-bentonville-is-better-than-your-city-at-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">Bentonville is now one of <em>the</em> bicycle towns</a>, home to the OZ trails, as well as <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/10-reasons-to-head-to-bentonville-arkansas-art-food-beer-mtb-gravel-more/\" target=\"_blank\">epic spots for road, gravel</a>, and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/mcelveen-rides-bentonville-in-a-day/\" target=\"_blank\">mountain biking</a>.
