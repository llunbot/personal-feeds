{"title":"★ Heyja Vu: App Store Rejects 37signals’s New Hey Calendar App","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/heyja_vu_hey_cal","date":1704774137000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/we-ve-resubmitted-the-hey-calendar-app-to-apple-57240fbb\">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple waited until end of business on Friday to send us the formal \nrejection of the HEY Calendar app. It seems they love to play \nthese little games to try to drown any controversy with the cover \nof a weekend. But we don’t roll over that easy, so the team worked \nthrough the weekend to prepare a new build to appease the App \nStore’s bullying bureaucrats, and I think you’re going to like \nwhat we came up with. </p>\n\n<p>See, Apple’s stated reason for rejecting the HEY Calendar app is \nonce again that “it doesn’t do anything when you download it”. In \nother words, it features a login screen, and requires you to have \nan existing account with <a href=\"https://www.hey.com/\">our HEY email service</a> in order \nto use it. It’s the textbook definition of a free companion app, \nwhich Apple specifically <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#business\">exempts from having to use in-app \npayments</a>. They even cite Email Services(!!) as an example \nin 3.1.3(f): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em><strong>3.1.3(f) Free Stand-alone Apps:</strong> Free apps acting as a \nstand-alone companion to a paid web based tool (eg. VOIP, Cloud \nStorage, Email Services, Web Hosting) do not need to use \nin-app purchase, provided there is no purchasing inside the app, \nor calls to action for purchase outside of the app.</em> </p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems bonkers to me that after <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/06/16/hey-iap-app-store-dispute\">all the bad publicity that befell Apple in June 2020</a> over Apple’s rejection of the Hey email app, they’d veto a Hey companion app — which requires the exact same type of account as Hey email — for the exact same reasons. They should have just let it through, for the risk of bad publicity alone.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s just a taste from my own coverage of the Hey email app rejection back in June 2020:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/06/17/dithering-hey-apple\">Dithering: ‘Hey Apple, Cut It Out’</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/06/17/embracing-apples-cut\">On Avoiding or Embracing Apple’s In-App Purchase Cut</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/06/19/schiller-panzer-hey\">Phil Schiller Talks to Matthew Panzarino on Hey’s App Store Rejection</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/06/19/swisher-app-store-hey\">Kara Swisher: ‘Is It Finally Hammer Time for Apple and Its App Store?’</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/06/20/siracusa-app-store\">Siracusa on the App Store: ‘Apple Needs to Decide if It Wants to Be “Right” or if It Wants to Be Happy’</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/06/22/apple-hey-path-forward\">Apple, Hey, and the Path Forward</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/06/22/patel-apple-hey\">Nilay Patel’s Summary of the Apple/Hey Drama</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Apple doesn’t want people writing articles like those (or this very one) this week. They want people writing articles about Vision Pro.</p>\n\n<p>More crucially, regulators and legislators around the world are looking to wield antitrust powers against Apple, and all of them are primarily looking at the App Store. The stakes for Apple are much higher today than they were in 2020. The last thing Apple wants is a news narrative along the lines of “<em>More Bullshit From Apple Trying to Squeeze Developers Into Giving Them a Cut of Revenue When the Developers Simply Want to Sell Subscriptions Directly to Customers Over the Web</em>”. But by rejecting Hey Calendar, they seem to be <em>inviting</em> such a narrative.</p>\n\n<p>I just don’t get it. Apple has nothing to gain by this — *nothing, not a cent — but a lot to lose.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update, one day later:</strong> <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/apple-approves-the-hey-calendar-c76ebd9c\">Apple approved the Hey Calendar app</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e2ef2d619fa9d522bb23620204be56f991d2528f8b49db409768eda8742a1191","category":"Tech"}
