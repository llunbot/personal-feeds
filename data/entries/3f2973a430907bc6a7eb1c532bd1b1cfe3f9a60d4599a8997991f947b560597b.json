RCS support on the iPhone will extend the features to green bubbles in the Messages app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Design Changes</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-Design-1.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nIn a February edition of his newsletter, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple was working to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/ios-18-design-changes-rumors/\">update the design of iOS</a> as \"early as this year.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman has yet to reveal any specific design changes planned for iOS.
