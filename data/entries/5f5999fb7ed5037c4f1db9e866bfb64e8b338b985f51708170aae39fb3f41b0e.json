I’m glad to see Apple offer these tiers — it’s long seemed a bit odd that a services-focused company had no tiers above 2 TB. (Disappointingly, none of the iCloud storage tiers have increased in size — the free tier remains a measly 5 GB and the $1/month plan just 50 GB.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/18/ios-17-release-day\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5f5999fb7ed5037c4f1db9e866bfb64e8b338b985f51708170aae39fb3f41b0e","category":"Tech"}
