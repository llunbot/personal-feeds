It might sound crazy, but I think it’s the\nreason I wanted to make movies. It’s ‘The Poseidon Adventure.’ It\nliterally was my favorite movie when it came out. I think I was 7\nor something and I went to see it in the theater about 10 times,\nthen watched it repeatedly whenever it was on TV. It was so\nformative, and you were so good in it, and it just for me was my\nfavorite movie for so long because of the excitement of that\nincredible score and those actors and the action and just all of\nit. It really changed my life and just … made me want to make\nmovies.”</p>\n\n<p>He smiled a little. He looked forward, thinking, perhaps about the\nmovie, as if it hadn’t crossed his mind for a long time. Then he\ngrinned and said:</p>\n\n<p>“Money job.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can hear those words in Hackman’s voice. And I can see the grin.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/money-job\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"672c34d6be6ff655d90816728c2e0e6ba90f2cccb2236a43e49709379efb847b","category":"Tech"}
