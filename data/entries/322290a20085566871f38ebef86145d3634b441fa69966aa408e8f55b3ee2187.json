Apple also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/25/icloud-private-relay-ios-15-public-beta/\">labeled iCloud Private Relay as a beta feature</a> last month.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf you lose your AirPods Pro or AirPods Max and someone else with an ‌iPhone‌, iPad, or Mac comes close to them, the Find My network will be able to relay an approximate location of the headphones securely and privately back to you. The feature is designed to help you get within Bluetooth range of the AirPods so you can play a sound and locate them.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/19/when-is-ios-15-public-release/\">iOS 15 will be released tomorrow</a> following over three months of beta testing. The software update is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-iphone-ipad-compatibility/\">compatible with the same iPhones as iOS 14</a>, including older devices like the original iPhone SE and iPhone 6s. iPadOS 15, watchOS 8, and tvOS 15 will also be released tomorrow, while a release date for macOS Monterey has yet to be announced.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(Hat tip to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tme_michael/status/1439725633790267392\">Michael Burkhardt</a>!)</em><div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max\">AirPods Max (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/19/find-my-network-airpods-coming-later-this-fall/\">Apple Says Find My Network Support for AirPods Delayed Until Later This Fall</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-find-my-network-support-for-airpods-delayed-until-later-this-fall.2311965/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HzoOvYIGQmg:D_hk_DYPjXA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HzoOvYIGQmg:D_hk_DYPjXA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/HzoOvYIGQmg\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"322290a20085566871f38ebef86145d3634b441fa69966aa408e8f55b3ee2187","category":"Apple"}
