There will, of course, be great anticipation as the astronauts close in on their launch date, currently projected for late 2024 or 2025.</p>\n<p>But many of the crew’s days over the next 18 months will be spent in classrooms, on airplanes, or in simulators, with instructors dispensing knowledge they deem crucial for the success of the Artemis II mission. In the simulator, the training team will throw malfunctions and anomalies at the astronauts to test their ability to resolve a failure that—if it happened in space—could cut the mission short or, in a worst-case scenario, kill them.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954616#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954616&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5048c5041fd1d86e433ca798ac35818480c820c73d95c248a909ae3e5016b917","category":"Tech"}
