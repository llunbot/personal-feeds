The new Carbon Wasp 3D-printed titanium crank arms will drop 170g off the original aluminum ones, and look good doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand has made carbon fiber cranks for Pinion units in the past. Those were light, but always required some sort of metal insert to pinch clamp onto the spindle, which is part of the gearbox. That metal part was tricky to machine because of its intricate spline interface, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-2.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1506\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-2.jpg\" alt=\"carbon wasp titanium crank arms for pinion gearbox\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-2.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-2-297x224.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-2-800x602.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-2-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-2-768x578.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-2-1536x1157.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But 3D printing it, that could be easy, and done with titanium. As they experimented, they found they could print an entire hollow ti crankarm that was as light as anything they could make out of carbon. They admit, a full metal part is a bit off brand, but itâ€™s a better part, so they went with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-3.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1999\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-3.jpg\" alt=\"carbon wasp titanium crank arms for pinion gearbox\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-3.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-3-270x300.jpg 270w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-3-800x888.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-3-108x120.jpg 108w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-3-768x853.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-3-1383x1536.jpg 1383w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The two crank arms weigh in at a combined ~280g, which is 170g lighter than stock. They come in 165/170/175mm lengths for $804, or get a custom length and/or Q-factor for $866, letting you fit your body, fat bikes, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://carbonwasp.com/en-us/products/titanium-pinion-cranks?variant=47260721840429\" target=\"_blank\">CarbonWasp.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/carbon-wasp-3d-prints-titanium-cranks-for-pinion-gearboxes/\">Carbon Wasp 3D Prints Titanium Cranks for Pinion Gearboxes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"33bba08e7be17de13e49e81393766997d386ebed265471611403d821b46f8b87","category":"Cycling"}
