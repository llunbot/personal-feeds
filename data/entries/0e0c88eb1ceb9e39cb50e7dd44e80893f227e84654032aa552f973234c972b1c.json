In my younger days, I lugged around a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/165916/17inchpowerbook.html\">17-inch PowerBook G4</a> with pride, boasting about how I wasn’t willing to compromise screen size and battery life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My penchant for large MacBooks continued for a couple of decades, all the way through to the 16-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 Max. But then I reviewed the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2259608/15-inch-macbook-air-m3-review.html\">15-inch M3 MacBook Air</a> and I dumped the 16-inch MacBook Pro as my daily driver. I even <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2510333/14-inch-m4-macbook-pro-review.html\">loved the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro</a> when I tried it last year too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a user like me, bigger isn’t better. And now I think I want to go even smaller, smaller than a 13-inch MacBook Air. What I really want is for Apple to revive the 12-inch MacBook. Thanks to Apple silicon and modern-day components, a 12-inch MacBook could be a game changer for MacBook users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The M4 is buff enough</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple silicon is the main reason I don’t need a large MacBook anymore. Performance sacrifices for smaller footprints still exist, but the gap is nowhere near what it used to be. While Apple still outfits its larger laptops with its fastest chips, the base M-series chip is fast enough for users like me who use creative (but not pro) apps on a semi-regular basis. That wasn’t the case with Intel or PowerPC chips–while smaller laptops with those processors worked fine, the extra oomph the larger laptops made a significant difference.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14inch-m4-macbook-pro-right-angle.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"14inch M4 MacBook Pro\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14inch-m4-macbook-pro-right-angle.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14inch-m4-macbook-pro-right-angle.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14inch-m4-macbook-pro-right-angle.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14inch-m4-macbook-pro-right-angle.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14inch-m4-macbook-pro-right-angle.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14inch-m4-macbook-pro-right-angle.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14inch-m4-macbook-pro-right-angle.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14inch-m4-macbook-pro-right-angle.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The 14-inch MacBook Pro with its M4 chip is an excellent laptop for almost anyone. But imagine that M4 in an even smaller laptop. That would be cool.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>When the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234838/13-inch-macbook-pro-m1-review-amazing-breakthroughs-in-processing-and-battery-performance.html\">M1 was introduced</a>, it smoked the Intel processors it replaced. The performance has improved with each generation of the M chip, and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2521284/for-the-first-time-ever-you-dont-need-to-be-afraid-to-buy-a-new-mac.html\">M4 is plenty fast for just about anyone</a>. An M4 (or any future base M chip) with 16GB of RAM is plenty of power perfect for a 12-inch MacBook. Remember—the original MacBook had an Intel Core M processor with 8GB of RAM in 2015, a dinosaur compared to what Apple offers now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Portability is the priority</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>MacBooks are no longer primarily secondary or travel computers. Many if not most are treated as desktop Macs, plugged into a hub and rarely ever leaving home. But that’s not the case for everyone. I use a laptop because I often move locations for work. Also, I travel often and like to take my MacBook with me for working on the go. When I do, I’m not looking for the power or screen size of a MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest knock on the original MacBook was its lack of ports—it had just one USB-C port. I’m fine with that. I hardly ever plug in peripheral devices into my MacBook when I’m working remotely. So, one USB-C port is all I need for charging or plugging in a device like an SSD or a display. Battery life is so good now that I rarely run into an issue when I need to connect something while the port is occupied for charging. Apple doesn’t even need to include MagSafe or an audio jack. Just gi oneve me USB-C port and that’s it.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/m3-macbook-air-profile-magsafe.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"15 inch MacBook Air 2024\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/m3-macbook-air-profile-magsafe.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/m3-macbook-air-profile-magsafe.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/m3-macbook-air-profile-magsafe.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/m3-macbook-air-profile-magsafe.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/m3-macbook-air-profile-magsafe.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/m3-macbook-air-profile-magsafe.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/m3-macbook-air-profile-magsafe.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/m3-macbook-air-profile-magsafe.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>I use a MacBook Air and rarely use its ports.

Apple could use the modem in a 12-inch MacBook and promote it as an ultraportable Mac that’s so thin and light you can take it virtually anywhere and stay connected.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>An iPad Pro isn’t good enough</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As you read this, you might be thinking—just buy an iPad Pro. In many ways, it’s the best device for traveling: it’s light and portable, comes with cellular, and has a super-fast M-series chip. And there are times when I travel with an iPad instead of a Mac and still get things done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for the times when I need to hunker down and work, I want to use macOS, not iPadOS. Even with split-screen and Stage Manager, multitasking on the iPad just isn’t the same. The apps I use most aren’t as full-featured on the iPad and it’s just a lot easier to navigate between those apps on macOS. Even with a Magic Keyboard and Stage Manager, switching between apps in iPadOS isn’t as effortless as it is on the Mac. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple once made a 12-inch MacBook–I <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230161/macbook-kaby-lake-2017-review.html\">reviewed the last one Apple released</a> before it was discontinued. Back then, I called it a “MacBook worth bragging about.” <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232994/the-12-inch-macbook-is-dead-and-it-will-be-missed.html\">Odes to the 12-inch MacBook</a> <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/235008/the-case-for-a-12-inch-macbook-air.html\">aren’t new</a>, but if that old laptop was cool, then an M-series 12-inch MacBook would be out of this world.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0e0c88eb1ceb9e39cb50e7dd44e80893f227e84654032aa552f973234c972b1c","category":"Apple"}
