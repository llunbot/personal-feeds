These hot melt chain wax additives were inspired by the food industry, where they’re trying to find a replacement for trans fats and hydrogenated oils. Turns out, they can make it a whole lot easier to wax your chain, too, by eliminating the need to degrease your chain before waxing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, we geek out on how that product works, the nuances of wax temperatures for proper chain waxing, and talk a lot about where his ideas come from, what else he’s excited about, and why his stuff costs more than everyone else’s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always love talking to Josh, and I think you’re going to really enjoy this one, too.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<h3><strong>Want More?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Find every episode of the BikeRumor Podcast on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/bikerumor-podcast/id1455519558\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/6CJD6UAmN9OHfttF4e9lx1\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.podbean.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Podbean</a>, and through <a href=\"https://feed.podbean.com/bikerumor/feed.xml\" target=\"_blank\">RSS</a>, or wherever you listen to podcasts! Hit like, hit subscribe, and hit play!
