Its YA protagonists, hipster-slanted coming-of-age stories, and proximity to trauma make it part of a specific genre, and the series has proven unexpectedly adept at mostly reinventing itself from entry to entry. </p>\n<p>In theory, these underpinnings might suggest a (hear us out) <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/silent-hill/\"><em>Silent Hill</em></a>-style problem that the series has so far managed to avoid. But where Konami's survival horror series punished its protagonists through unique, hellish manifestations reflecting their specific inner demons, <em>Life is Strange</em>'s supernatural abilities empower its characters. Our protagonists aren't defined by their tragedies. They could be anything, which allows series developers much more freedom to try new ideas.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792128#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792128&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Steve Haske","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"38244ce0f6e145facc2e4942e707c8c2c3a63c1cb832f5df0c30a07ed0805a19","category":"Tech"}
