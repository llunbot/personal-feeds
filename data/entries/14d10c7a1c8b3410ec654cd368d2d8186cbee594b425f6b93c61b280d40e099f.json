Women had to find solutions themselves,’ says Burt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘For instance, saddles which have a gap were designed for men to help with numbness issues. Some women will find these saddles comfortable whilst others will not, because women have about nine different presentations of genitalia, whereas men only really have one, which makes their needs much more complex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘When a saddle says that it takes away pressure, this is not the case because pressure needs to go somewhere.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where do I need

Fowler</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Burt, women place more pressure on the front of a saddle, which means the saddle needs to support this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Because women have wider hips, generally women have weaker external hip rotators, that’s the glutes, so quite often you see a lot of women rotate forward on the pelvis, and they put a lot of pressure in front, and you can’t change it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It doesn’t mean women are weak, it’s just biomechanically the way they are, but it means they need saddles which support this front pressure.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n

rider sits also impacts saddle choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘While a lot of people don’t sit on their sit bones, a lot of women do, so this needs to be taken into consideration as well,’ explains Burt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘For example when someone says they feel like they are pushing back on their saddle, nine times out of ten they will feel better on a wider saddle as they are searching for that support.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly, it isn’t a one size fits all situation so Burt advises riders to measure their sit bones in order to find the right width saddle for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An easy way of doing this is to sit on a piece of corrugated cardboard, sit on it for a few minutes, and measure from the mid point of each of the marks made on the cardboard. This is your sit bone width.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>It’s not <em>all </em>about the saddle</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/03021401/gettyimages-1394623798-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"gettyimages-1394623798\" /><figcaption>Bas Czerwinski via Getty</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While looking at the saddle is of the utmost importance, Burt adds that sometimes pain can be caused by other factors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The chamois is important too. Wearing <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-womens-bibshorts-buyers-guide\" target=\"_blank\">bib shorts</a> that are too big can also impact comfort, so it is important to wear the right size and have a supportive chamois which stays in the right place when riding.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/03021413/gettyimages-1151578844-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"gettyimages-1151578844\" /><figcaption>Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno via Getty</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With all that in mind, however, the most important element to sorting out saddle pain is to change one thing at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Start with changing one thing, and then try others, don’t change everything at once,’ says Burt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘If you try to change lots of things, like saddle positioning, tilt, saddle, and wear a new pair of bib shorts, you won’t know what is actually working. No one saddle fits all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, each rider will have different saddle requirements and there is no saddle which fits all but the key things to consider are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Sit bone width</li><li>Pressure areas</li><li>Riding style</li><li>Bib shorts and chamois fit</li><li>Tilt degree</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why should you trust our advice?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/liv-devote-advanced-2-alex-duffill-1-2-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Cole riding the Liv Devote in some epic scenery\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/liv-devote-advanced-2-alex-duffill-1-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/liv-devote-advanced-2-alex-duffill-1-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/liv-devote-advanced-2-alex-duffill-1-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/liv-devote-advanced-2-alex-duffill-1-2-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/liv-devote-advanced-2-alex-duffill-1-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/liv-devote-advanced-2-alex-duffill-1-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/liv-devote-advanced-2-alex-duffill-1-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/liv-devote-advanced-2-alex-duffill-1-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/liv-devote-advanced-2-alex-duffill-1-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/liv-devote-advanced-2-alex-duffill-1-2.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Alex Duffill</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve been testing and reviewing cycling gear since 2012 and absolutely love riding our bikes.

is ideal for any cycling discipline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This saddle has most of the features of the S-Works Power (below) but weighing 50g more comes in at a much keener price point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The
