And now that you've had time <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/windows-11-the-ars-technica-review/\">to read our full review</a>, you might be thinking about installing the upgrade on your own PC.</p>\n\n<p>We think most people should wait a few months to give Microsoft time to iron out Windows 11's biggest new-operating-system bugs and finish releasing updates for Windows' built-in apps. But you may want to install the operating system anyway because you want to test it or because you like to run the newest thing. Or maybe you'd like to install Windows 11 on an \"unsupported\" PC because Microsoft is not your parent and therefore cannot tell you what to do.</p>\n<p>We've pulled together all kinds of resources to create a comprehensive install guide to upgrading to Windows 11. This includes advice and some step-by-step instructions for turning on officially required features like your TPM and Secure Boot, as well as official and unofficial ways to skirt the system-requirement checks on unsupported PCs.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1800798#p3\">Read 45 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1800798&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7a563b96bcb48be19693564707b51362b0e922825543b7b99026929f0189ac85","category":"Tech"}
