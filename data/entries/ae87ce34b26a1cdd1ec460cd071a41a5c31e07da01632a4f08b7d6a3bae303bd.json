Pacheco Canyon Road is a local’s favorite, offering shade and cooler temperatures during the summer months. This secluded gravel road follows a deeply embedded canyon before wrapping around the mountains to Hyde Park Road. From there, either take on the Red Chile climb up to the radio towers above town or descend back down to town on Hyde Park Road. Add in some extra Dale Ball central singletrack to spice things up!</p>\n<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/StargazerOvernighter-1.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/StargazerOvernighter-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/StargazerOvernighter-1.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/StargazerOvernighter-1.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/StargazerOvernighter-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Pacheco Canyon Quick Hits</h3>\n<p>Difficulty: Intermediate/Hard<br />\nBike: Gravel, Mountain Bike – Rigid, Hardtail<br />\nDistance: 35 miles (Green Chile), 48 miles (Red Chile)<br />\nElevation: 4000′ (Green Chile), 6400′ (Red Chile)<br />\nEstimate time: 3-4 hours (Green Chile), 6-8 hours (Red Chile)<br />\nBest time of year: Late Spring through Fall<br />\n<a href=\"https://ridewithgps.com/routes/48468129\" target=\"_blank\">Pacheco Canyon Gravel – LINK TO GPS ROUTE GREEN CHILE</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://ridewithgps.com/routes/47168082\" target=\"_blank\">Town to Towers – LINK TO GPS ROUTE RED CHILE</a></p>\n<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/Arya_Ronnie_Ride-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/Arya_Ronnie_Ride-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/Arya_Ronnie_Ride-1.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/Arya_Ronnie_Ride-1.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/Arya_Ronnie_Ride-1.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/Arya_Ronnie_Ride-1.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/Arya_Ronnie_Ride-1.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/Arya_Ronnie_Ride-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Need to Know</h3>\n<p><strong>Weather:</strong> During the summer months, monsoon rainstorms build all morning before breaking in the early afternoon. They can last anywhere from twenty minutes to multiple hours long. Be sure to check the local weather, as well as the Tesuque Peak weather before embarking on this ride. Don’t forget a rain jacket and if you do get caught in a thunderstorm, seek shelter.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/SFNF_Overnighter_Onur-32.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/SFNF_Overnighter_Onur-32.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/SFNF_Overnighter_Onur-32.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/SFNF_Overnighter_Onur-32.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/SFNF_Overnighter_Onur-32.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Water:</strong> There are several perennial streams, as well as multiple springs along the route, so bring a water filter.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/TownTowersGravelMiguel-16.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/TownTowersGravelMiguel-16.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/TownTowersGravelMiguel-16.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/TownTowersGravelMiguel-16.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/TownTowersGravelMiguel-16.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/TownTowersGravelMiguel-22.jpg?fit=1200,1600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/TownTowersGravelMiguel-22.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/TownTowersGravelMiguel-22.jpg?resize=1200,960&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/TownTowersGravelMiguel-22.jpg?resize=768,614&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/TownTowersGravelMiguel-22.jpg?resize=1536,1229&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Routing:</strong> To pedal from town, we recommend starting in the Railyard, then head up along the Old Taos Highway into the village of Tesuque, make your way across badlands, and climb up into the Santa Fe National Forest along Pacheco Canyon Road, aka Forest Service #102.</p>\n<p>You’ve got a few options with this ride.
