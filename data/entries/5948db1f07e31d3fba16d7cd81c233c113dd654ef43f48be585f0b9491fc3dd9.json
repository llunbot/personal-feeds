They promise modest CPU performance increases alongside big power efficiency and battery life improvements, much faster graphics performance, and a new neural processing engine (NPU) that will meet <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/\">Microsoft's requirements for Copilot+ PCs</a> that use local rather than cloud processing for generative AI and machine-learning features.</p>\n<h2>Intel Core Ultra 200V</h2>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/intel-lunar-lake-12-2.jpeg\"><img alt=\"The high-level enhancements coming to the Lunar Lake Core Ultra chips. \" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/intel-lunar-lake-12-2-980x429.jpeg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/intel-lunar-lake-12-2.jpeg\">The high-level enhancements coming to the Lunar Lake Core Ultra chips. </a> (credit: Intel)</p></div>\n\n<p>The most significant numbers in today's update are actually about battery life: Intel compared a Lunar Lake system and a Snapdragon X Elite system from the \"same OEM\" using the \"same chassis\" and the same-sized 55 WHr battery. In the Procyon Office Productivity test, the Intel system lasted longer, though the Qualcomm system lasted longer on a Microsoft Teams call.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046729#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046729&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5948db1f07e31d3fba16d7cd81c233c113dd654ef43f48be585f0b9491fc3dd9","category":"Tech"}
