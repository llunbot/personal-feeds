Here’s why.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Convenience</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>MagSafe is both wireless and magnetic, which means it’s quick and easy to connect. Unlike most wireless chargers, a MagSafe accessory magnetically ‘pulls’ the device into the best charging position so there’s no need to worry about hitting the sweet spot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reliability</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>MagSafe is Apple’s own proprietary charging standard, so there’s no worry about compatibility: Apple clearly indicates which of its devices work with the standard. (Put simply, all the 12-, 13- and 14-series iPhones support MagSafe. So do the 2022 AirPods Pro, while the 2021 AirPods are available with a MagSafe charging case.) It can also be depended on to work reliably and efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Speed</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>MagSafe offers 15W fast charging so your devices will be topped up quickly. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"ESR\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></figure><p>ESR</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span>Which MagSafe accessories are best?</span></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest range of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/BA30A591-164A-4BCF-8185-3AE8C89C8446?maas=maas_adg_850737BF8F9234712C28CDC21A13D3F0_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_ma&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">ESR charging accessories</a> are a great choice, bringing you the very best of MagSafe charging performance. Here are the specific advantages of these products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Charging speed</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Independent testing consistently shows that ESR accessories charge Apple devices, even when in use, faster than rival third-party accessories. The firm’s MagSafe car charger, for example, took just 125 minutes in testing to completely charge an iPhone 14 Pro while using navigation apps, whereas rival models took two and a half times as long, or were unable to charge the device to full power. ESR chargers are able to offer this exceptional speed through their high power ratings and the incorporation of proprietary CryoBoost cooling technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CryoBoost</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tech products heat up when charging at 15W, particularly if running apps at the same time. Ordinary 15W MagSafe chargers have to throttle their power output to avoid overheating, but the latest generation of ESR chargers have built-in fans to avoid these issues. A constant flow of cooling air ensures charging can be maintained at maximum speed without overheating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Certification</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>ESR’s new chargers have received Apple’s full <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/334301/buyer-beware-magsafe-compatible-is-not-the-same-as-made-for-magsafe.html\">Made for MagSafe</a> certification. (Similarly, the company’s new Apple Watch chargers have Made For Apple Watch certification.) This means you can depend on them working optimally with a range of Apple products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Versatility</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=http://www.esrgear.com/&amp;xcust=1-1-2017865-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">ESR</a> offers hybrid charging units that can charge more than one kind of Apple device at the same time: not just iPhones and AirPods, but Apple Watches, MacBooks and iPads as well. You don’t need to buy multiple chargers, or wait patiently for one device to finish charging so you can charge another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Value for money</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>ESR’s accessories are designed to provide a quality user experience without breaking the bank. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/7.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"ESR\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/7.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/7.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/7.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/7.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></figure><p>ESR</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span>Which ESR MagSafe accessory should you pick?</span></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>25W 3-in-1 Wireless Charger with MagSafe + CryoBoost</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A versatile charging unit that can fast-charge an iPhone, an Apple Watch, and a set of AirPods at the same time.
