Since it uses the standard two-bolt cage mounting pattern, you can use any bottle cage you like, or attach other accessories that fit. Maximum weight limit per cage mount (i.e. per side) is 2lbs, and it’s designed for “moderate riding conditions”, so probably best if you stick with smaller bottles and don’t take it mountain biking.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154338/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154338/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-4.jpg\" alt=\"PDW thru axle sliding dropouts with post mount disc brake mounts\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1199\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154338/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-4.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154338/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-4-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154338/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-4-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154338/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-4-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154338/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154338/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-4-1536x1151.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>Long a go-to part for custom bikes and handmade frame builders, the PMW sliding dropout finally gets a fully modernized design specifically for 12mm thru axles.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154336/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154336/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-3.jpg\" alt=\"PDW thru axle sliding dropouts with post mount disc brake mounts\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154336/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-3.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154336/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-3-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154336/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-3-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154336/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-3-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154336/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154336/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-3-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>Much sleeker than before, the low profile design allows for all three brake rotor mounts – ISO, Post Mount for 160mm rotors, and now Flat Mount for 140mm rotors. Beyond just aesthetics, the real benefit to this new design is that braking forces are no longer able to put pressure on the sliding direction, so braking</p><p>Another improved feature is that the adjuster screws coming in from the back of the dropout now has fully captured hardware. So, even if everything came lose, you won’t lose that screw, and your wheel’s position shouldn’t change.&nbsp;On the drive side, there are options for hanger or no hanger (singlespeed).</p><p>The thru axle’s threads are a metric 12×1.5 thread pitch, but it’s wide, so the only skewer that’s going to fit is the one they make for this dropout. But don’t worry, whoever is building your frame is likely buying all of these parts to fit the spec you order. But if you need a replacement, call PMW.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154333/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154333/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-2.jpg\" alt=\"PDW thru axle sliding dropouts with SRAM UDH derailleur hanger\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154333/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-2.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154333/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-2-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154333/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-2-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154333/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-2-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23154333/portland-design-works-steerer-mount-bottle-cage-holders-2-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p>They also have a new fixed-position dropout designed specifically for the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-introduces-universal-derailleur-hanger-concept-and-its-brilliant/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SRAM UDH derailleur hanger</a>, which is nice because that’s a great hanger design that makes it much easier to find a replacement, and shops have fewer items to inventory.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sram-direct-mount-rear-derailleur-thru-axle-mount2.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sram-direct-mount-rear-derailleur-thru-axle-mount2.gif\" alt=\"sram patent for direct mount rear derailleur that attaches to the thru axle dropout\" width=\"1000\" height=\"895\"></a></p><p>But, word on the street is SRAM had a bit of an ulterior motive in introducing the UDH.
