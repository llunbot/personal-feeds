Apple is selling no braided USB-C to USB-C cables in colors that match the iPhones, though there is a 1-meter black Thunderbolt 4 cable that enables USB 3.1 transfer speeds of up to 10Gb/s on the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/\">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-no-color-matched-cables/\">iPhone 15 Models Do Not Come With Rumored Color-Matched Braided USB-C Cables</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-models-do-not-come-with-rumored-color-matched-braided-usb-c-cables.2401276/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d07ba19d5a0c08b4a32572783ad7efdd7c9d276c53f66dda77cafff8655fa5ac","category":"Apple"}
