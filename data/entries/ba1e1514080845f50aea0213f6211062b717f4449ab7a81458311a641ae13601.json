Internal Microsoft data obtained by Windows Central <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/exclusive-windows-11-is-active-on-almost-half-a-billion-devices-ahead-of-microsofts-expectations\">claims</a> that Windows 11 is currently in use on around 400 million PCs, almost exactly two years after the operating system's October 2021 release.</p>\n<p>Windows 10 had been installed on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/windows-10-hits-500-million-devices-growing-by-two-thirds-in-a-year/\">over 500 million systems by its second birthday</a>, which backs up data we've seen from sources like Statcounter and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/04/gamers-are-adopting-windows-11-about-half-as-quickly-as-they-did-for-windows-10/\">the Steam Hardware Survey</a>—Windows 11 just isn't being adopted at the same rate as its predecessor. Worldwide Windows market share data from Statcounter suggests that Windows 11 <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide\">runs on between 23 and 24 percent of Windows PCs</a>, compared to 72 percent for Windows 10, and Statcounter shows Windows 11's growth has stagnated in recent months. Still, Windows 11's numbers are said to surpass Microsoft's internal expectations.</p>\n<p>It's difficult to directly compare Windows 10's adoption rate and Windows 11's. Windows 10 was explicitly intended to run on any system that could already run Windows 7 and Windows 8, the two most popular versions of the operating system at the time of its release. Microsoft also offered it to those users as a free upgrade for one year, a then-unprecedented move meant to spur people to upgrade their existing PCs rather than wait to get Windows 10 on a new one. By contrast, Windows 11's system requirements generally limit it to PCs released in or after late 2017 and 2018, cutting off a large number of PCs that are running Windows 10 just fine.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976808#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976808&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ba1e1514080845f50aea0213f6211062b717f4449ab7a81458311a641ae13601","category":"Tech"}
