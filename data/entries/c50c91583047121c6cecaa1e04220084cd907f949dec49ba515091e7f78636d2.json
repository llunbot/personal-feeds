These include your mileage, riding conditions and how often you walk on your <a href=\"http://bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-cycling-shoes/\">clipless cycling shoes</a>.</p>\n<p>As a cleat wears out and material gets worn away, its connection with the pedal degrades. This can make it harder to clip in (or out) because the cleat is no longer able to easily open the pedal’s locking mechanism for entry or exit.</p>\n<p>In some cases, a worn cleat may also cause unexpected unclips while pedalling.</p>\n<p>However, sometimes these issues can occur without the cleat being excessively worn. In this case, a simple adjustment of the pedal’s spring mechanism should fix the issue.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"David Time pedals\" title=\"David Time pedals\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Adjusting your pedal can sometimes fix loose cleats.</span></figcaption><span> <i>THE MERIDA EX ENDURO / Jon Woodhouse</i></span></div>\n<p>If the problem persists despite the spring adjustment, it’s likely time to replace your cleats.</p>\n<p>Some cleats, such as Shimano’s SPD-SL road offering, feature coloured wear indicators which, when worn away, signify the cleats should be replaced.</p>\n<p>While wear indicators can be helpful, we recommend you also pay attention to the cleats’ performance when deciding whether or not to replace them.</p>\n<h2>When to replace road cleats</h2>\n<p>To make sure your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-pedals/\">road bike pedals</a> keep performing at their best, it’s important to replace your cleats before they get worn excessively. Here’s how you can tell when to replace your cleats.</p>\n<h3>Shimano SPD-SL</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"See the alignment marks?

It is imperative to change your cleats as soon as one of them appears. You will see the indicator appearing when the white layer becomes flush with the red, grey or black layer.”</p>\n<h3>Time</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Time iclic cleat\" title=\"Time iclic cleat\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Time’s road cleats have built-in wear indicators.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Time</i></span></div>\n<p>Time’s ICLIC road pedals feature walk pads that double as wear indicators.</p>\n<p>Time advises replacing its cleats when release from the pedals becomes harder, or when the walk pads show signs of wear.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Time cleats.\" title=\"time-cleats\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Time mountain bike cleats follow the same two-bolt attachment as Shimano SPDs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Time’s ATAC off-road cleats don’t feature walk pads or wear indicators, so it’s important to stay on top of changes in the entry and release performance to gauge wear.</p>\n<h3>Wahoo Speedplay</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Speedplay cleats are well engineered in terms of how they interface with the pedal body but they're rough for walking, being both slippery and prone to expensive wear\" title=\"1332412408735-i76oav73fnqb-d60f36f\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Speedplay cleats are well engineered in terms of how they interface with the pedal body, but they’re rough for walking, being both slippery and prone to wear.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James Huang/BikeRadar</i></span></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/wahoo-speedplay-zero-pedals-review/\">Wahoo Speedplay</a> cleats use an inverted design, where the pedal effectively clips into the cleat.</p>\n<p>This means the cleat’s connecting interface does not protrude from the sole of the shoe, increasing its lifespan.</p>\n<p>Wahoo advises replacing its cleats when they show advanced wear. It is also strongly advised not to use a combination of new and old cleat parts when replacing the system.</p>\n<h3>When to replace mountain bike cleats</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Picture showing person installing two-bolt cleat on bottom of cycling shoe.\" title=\"how-to-change-a-cleat-20221130_78\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Mountain bike cleats are usually made from metal.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Mountain bike cleats are typically a lot smaller than their road counterparts and lack wear indicators.</p>\n<p>They are also made of metal, unlike a lot of road cleats, which are often made of plastic, and sit in a recessed cleat box in the sole of the shoe.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cleats for the Crankbrothers Candy 1 gravel pedals\" title=\"Crankbrothers Candy 1 - 05\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Crankbrothers cleats use the same two-bolt connection as SPDs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Katherine Moore / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Popular designs include Shimano SPD, Crankbrothers and HT. When it comes to gauging wear, the advice is very similar across the board.</p>\n<p>Because mountain bike cleats don’t have specific wear indicators, it’s important to pay attention to changes in their interaction with the pedal when clipping in and out, as well as increased float or play once clipped in.</p>\n<p>At this point, they will often look worn and rounded at the edges.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Recon Lace Gravel shoes review\" title=\"Specialized S-Works Recon Lace Gravel shoes review\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Shimano SPDs are used for all disciplines of mountain biking.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://bike.shimano.com/en-US/information/news/shimano-spd-and-cleat-technology.html#:~:text=SPD%20cleats%20are%20quite%20durable,your%20cleats%20once%20a%20year.\" target=\"_blank\">An article on the Shimano website</a> states: “SPD cleats are quite durable, but as they wear, performance can be compromised.
