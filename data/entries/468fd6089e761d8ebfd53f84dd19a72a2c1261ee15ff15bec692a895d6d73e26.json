The updated Python pedals are competitively lightweight and boast a sleek design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Python pedals offer a healthy amount of grip in stock form, and FUNN sells optional longer pins for those who want more. To sum it up, I’d say the Python pedals are (in the best way) everything they need to be and nothing more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>FUNN Python Pedals – Construction:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-angle-table.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-angle-table-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-angle-table-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-angle-table-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-angle-table-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-angle-table-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-angle-table-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-angle-table.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Python pedals feature a 6061-T6 aluminum body which is forged, then trimmed down on a CNC machine. At 100x110x10.5mm, FUNN has provided a good-sized platform that should feel plenty supportive to anyone without huge feet, while keeping things pretty trim and lightweight.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-side-profile.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-side-profile-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-side-profile-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-side-profile-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-side-profile-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-side-profile-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-side-profile-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-side-profile.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pythons’ thin bodies help minimize pedal strikes, and FUNN has even machined down the outer ends of the pedals to a slimmer profile than the rest of the body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>FUNN says the Python pedals’ optimized profile maximizes pedal-to-shoe contact and pedaling efficiency. At first glance, they seem pretty flat, but there is a very slight concave to the Python pedal bodies. The front and rear ends are a tad thicker than the midsection of the pedal, so the middle pins sit slightly lower. Also, there is a tiny hump over the spindle (which looks bigger in the above photo than it really is) but I never felt it at all while riding. Those who enjoy a more concave pedal can always use the longer pins to achieve this… as I did. More on that below…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-angle-inside.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-angle-inside-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-angle-inside-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-angle-inside-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-angle-inside-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-angle-inside-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-angle-inside-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-angle-inside.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption><em>Note the full set of short pins in this photo, vs. the longer pins on either end in the profile pic above</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Funn specs the Pythons with a full set of short pins, but they offer an optional set of longer pins that are compatible with FUNN’s Python, Funndamental, Mamba, Mamba S, and Ripper pedals. The long pins are longer and thinner, and they definitely add more grip to the pedal vs. the short pins. Instead of a full-length spindle, the Python pedals utilize a stubby cartridge axle system for easy maintenance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-on-scale.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"529\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-on-scale-800x529.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-on-scale-800x529.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-on-scale-297x196.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-on-scale-120x79.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-on-scale-768x508.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-on-scale.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was impressed to see the Pythons weighed in at 373g for the pair, just beating FUNN’s claim of 375g.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ride Impressions:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-SF-climbing.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-SF-climbing-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-SF-climbing-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-SF-climbing-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-SF-climbing-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-SF-climbing-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-SF-climbing-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-SF-climbing.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As soon as I started riding the Pythons, I was impressed with how supportive the pedal bodies felt. These pedals don’t look huge, yet no matter where I put weight on my foot it always felt like there was plenty of pedal underneath. I think FUNN hit on a great shape that reaches out to all corners while still looking sleek.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pythons’ bodies are almost flat, and with the shorter set of stock pins, the pedals have a fairly flat feel. The grip is already pretty good with the short pins, offering a secure hold on your foot that still allows for easy re-positioning. I should note I rode the Pythons with my grippiest pair of shoes (FiveTen Freeriders).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-long-pins.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-long-pins-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-long-pins-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-long-pins-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-long-pins-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-long-pins-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-long-pins-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-long-pins.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>FUNN set me up with a set of the longer pins, so I did what I think a lot of riders would – I put them in the front and rear parts of the pedal and left the shorter pins in the middle. Immediately I preferred this setup; the longer pins offered noticeably more grip, and the pedals felt more concave (which I like). At this point adjusting a foot took a bit of intention, so I was happy with the level of grip and never installed the full set of longer pins. If you did you’d have one very grippy pedal, just with a less concave feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-SF-descending.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-SF-descending-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-SF-descending-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-SF-descending-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-SF-descending-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-SF-descending-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-SF-descending-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-SF-descending.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To be honest with our readers, I didn’t really get to beat the crap out of the Python pedals as most of my time spent with them were ‘rehab rides’ after an injury this spring. I’ve put some decent distance on them, but they haven’t been subjected to much on-trail abuse. My Pythons aren’t showing any concerning signs of wear, play, or damage, but they have had it pretty easy. If any serious issues occur this season, I will update this article accordingly!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-pair.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-pair-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-pair-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-pair-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-pair-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-pair-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-pair-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FUNN-Python-pedals-pair.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>FUNN’s new Python pedals retail for $115, and they will be available by the end of June.
