That being said, Apple has released new colors many more times than it has chosen not to do so since 2017.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 16‌ is available in Black, White, Teal, Pink, and Ultramarine. A new red, yellow, purple, or grey seem possible since these have all been offered on ‌iPhone‌ models in the past and are not too similar to any of the existing shades.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFollowing the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a>, as well as a range of new iPads and Macs, we're swiftly approaching the latest likely period for Apple to announce a new color option. There are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/\">usually rumors</a> that point to which new color to expect, but with no sign of this, it looks like Apple will probably skip this year's new color option just like it did for the ‌iPhone 15‌.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16\">iPhone 16 (Neutral)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/11/new-iphone-16-colors-looking-unlikely/\">New iPhone 16 Colors Looking Increasingly Unlikely</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-iphone-16-colors-looking-increasingly-unlikely.2452812/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"18b9dc92d6fdd302503aaa436e35dfddb80a863003b2acf0d53e530c9fd2eb2e","category":"Apple"}
