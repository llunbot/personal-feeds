But first, of course, this means it gets popped into our weekly round-up, First Look Friday.</p>\n<p>Before you read on, though, take a moment to look back through the week and see what else is new in the world of tech.</p>\n<p>The biggest news was, of course, the launch of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/sram/\">SRAM’s</a> latest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/mountain-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">mountain bike groupsets</a>, prefixed with T-Type.</p>\n<p>Do you remember SRAM launching its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-universal-derailleur-hanger/\">Universal Derailleur Hanger</a> back in 2019? Well, it looks as though it was a sneaky (or, rather obvious) plot to persuade the world’s bike manufacturers to get their bikes ready for this new style of direct-mount derailleur.</p>\n<p>Shimano has tried it in the past, but the smart money is on SRAM filling up spec lists on high-end mountain bikes with its derailleurs that no longer need a hanger.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, our drivetrain expert, Alex Evans, has been lapping with the new gears for a few months, many miles and very many metres of up and down.</p>\n<p>You can find all the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-t-type-eagle-transmission/\">details of SRAM’s T-Type Eagle Transmission</a>, our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-xx-t-type-eagle-transmission-powermeter-axs-review/\">review of SRAM T-Type</a> and a guide on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-install-and-set-up-sram-t-type-eagle/\">how to install SRAM T-Type</a> to your bike on the site (and on our YouTube channel and podcast).</p>\n\n<p>In other news, Canyon has released the latest version of its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-canyon-neuron/\">Neuron trail bike</a>. It has a more refined geometry, some lovely finishing touches and 140mm of travel. It looks, on paper, like the perfect UK trail bike, but what happened when <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/canyon-neuron-cf-9-sl-review/\">Luke Marshall reviewed the Neuron</a>?</p>\n<p>Staying with flat-barred and knobbly tyre’d bikes, Cane Creek has released perhaps the most Gucci of upgrades – <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/cane-creek-electric-wings/\">titanium cranks for your ebike</a>. I dare you to look at their price.</p>\n<p>Moving on to the curly-bar world, we saw the launch of new tyres from <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/new-pirelli-p-zero-race-tlr/\">Pirelli</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-goodyear-high-performance-tyres/\">Goodyear</a>.</p>\n<p>We also published a review of the Salsa Warbird gravel bike and our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-week/giant-revolt-x/\">Bike of the Week was Giant’s new Revolt X</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Le Col Pro Aqua Zero long-sleeve jersey</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Le Col Pro Aqua Zero is a three-season jersey for damp to wet rides.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / OurMedia</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><p>While the winter cold may well have departed us by now, it’s certainly not bone dry out there.
