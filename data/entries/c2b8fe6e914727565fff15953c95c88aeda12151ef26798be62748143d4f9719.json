According to research done in\nFlorence by Broccoli’s wife of 30 years, Dana, the brothers were\ndescended from the Broccolis of Carrera, who first crossed two\nItalian vegetables, cauliflower and rabe, to produce the dark\ngreen, thick-stalked vegetable that took their name and eventually\nsupported them in the United States.</p>\n\n<p>Giovanni’s brother started a broccoli farm on Long Island, and\nsoon all of Giovanni’s family worked for him. “Myself, my brother,\nmy mother, my father — all working on our hands and knees,” said\nBroccoli, who picked up the nickname Cubby (after a round-faced\ncomic strip character) at about that time. “Later on, we had our\nown farm.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/02/24/ep-417\">Two weeks ago on The Talk Show</a>, I even joked with Paul Kafasis about the fact that in over 30,000 posts in Daring Fireball’s history, the only ones that contain the string “broccoli” are ones about the Bond movies, not the vegetable.
