According to an <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/101560\">Apple support document</a>, customers now have 45 days to extend an AppleCare+ policy. Previously, Apple granted 30 days. The policy change seems to have gone into effect on August 14, when the support document was updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An AppleCare+ policy can be extended for 24 or 36 months and paid monthly or annually. The price varies, depending on the device. Users can check their device coverage by logging into  <a href=\"https://mysupport.apple.com\">mysupport.apple.com</a> with an Apple Account and then clicking on a product in the My Devices section.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the support document, the 45-day window is available in the U.K., U.S., Canada, Australia, and several other countries. However, in China, the window remains at 30 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AppleCare+ is Apple’s extended warranty program. All Apple hardware includes an AppleCare (without the “+”) warranty that usually lasts a year, with 90 days of phone support. AppleCare+ is available at the time of purchase or can be bought 60 days afterward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a guide that explains <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230521/applecare-warranty-faq.html\">everything you need to know about AppleCare+</a> if you need more information.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9965fb053ded9eef8034da6efbc86922e66fd197f2bfc41c2271c1f0fc419784","category":"Apple"}
