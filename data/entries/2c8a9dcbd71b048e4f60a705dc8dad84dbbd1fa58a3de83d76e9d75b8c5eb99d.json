According to a report in <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-27/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai\">Bloomberg</a>, the company is shifting some of the staff to work on generative AI projects within the company and planning layoffs for some others.</p>\n<p>Internally dubbed Project Titan, the long-in-development car would have ideally had a luxurious, limo-like interior, robust self-driving capabilities, and at least a $100,000 price tag. However, the ambition of the project was drawn down with time. For example, it was once planned to have Level 4 self-driving capabilities, but that was scaled back to Level 2+.</p>\n<p>Delays had pushed the car (on which work initially began way back in 2014) to a target release date of 2028. Now it won't be released at all.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006321#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006321&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2c8a9dcbd71b048e4f60a705dc8dad84dbbd1fa58a3de83d76e9d75b8c5eb99d","category":"Tech"}
