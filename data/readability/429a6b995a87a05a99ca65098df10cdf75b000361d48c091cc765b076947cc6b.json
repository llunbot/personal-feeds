Its non-PFC DWR (durable water repellent) treatment joins a select few others in the market.</p><h2>Why Be PFC-Free?</h2><p>PFC’s, or perfluorochemicals, are a group of synthetic chemicals known for water and oil repellency. They’re commonly used in, but not limited to, textiles <span>— they’re also the active agent in Teflon, Scotchgard, and various other non-stick or repellent treatments. The chains of strongly bonded carbon and fluorine atoms yield an almost impenetrable coating that’s great for its intended purpose.</span></p><p><span>The problem is that they’re toxic to pretty much everything alive; The EPA has <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-05/documents/biomonitoring-pfcs.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">linked PFC’s to adverse birth outcomes and thyroid disease</a> in humans. And because nothing in nature can degrade them, they’re highly environmentally persistent. That means they’ve become increasingly hazardous over time. Some studies suggest PFC’s are so pervasive that mothers transfer them to infants in utero “between 99% and 100%” of the time (see link above).</span></p><p><span>As such, the EPA has been phasing PFC and its various subordinate chemicals (PFOA, PFAS) out of the consumer market <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/research/pfcs-global-contaminants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">since the early 2000s</a>.&nbsp;</span>Recently, PFC-free waterproof textiles have been trickling into the outdoor market. For instance, high-volume textile supplier <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020/06/24/danny-macaskill-archive-the-6-month-barrel-roll-with-trailer-progression/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Polartec eliminated PFAS from its full product line in July</a>. The move reverberated across the outdoor and fashion industries and appeared to signal a glacial shift.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07181340/Milner_END019_RD1181.jpg\" alt=\"endura pfc-free re-proofer\" width=\"1220\" height=\"915\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07181340/Milner_END019_RD1181.jpg 1220w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07181340/Milner_END019_RD1181-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07181340/Milner_END019_RD1181-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07181340/Milner_END019_RD1181-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07181340/Milner_END019_RD1181-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1220px) 100vw, 1220px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07181340/Milner_END019_RD1181.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07181340/Milner_END019_RD1181.jpg 1220w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07181340/Milner_END019_RD1181-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07181340/Milner_END019_RD1181-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07181340/Milner_END019_RD1181-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07181340/Milner_END019_RD1181-768x576.jpg 768w\"></p><h2>PFC-Free Re-Proofer and Other Waterproof Treatments</h2><p>Though the movement against PFC’s in DWR fabrics is in its relative infancy, PFC-free waterproof treatments have existed for some time. The ubiquitous Nikwax, for example, is PFC-free across its entire product range. So it’s relatively expected that Endura, a conscientious brand with <a href=\"https://endura.echoscomm.com/endura-planted-more-than-13-million-trees-in-2020-will-become-carbon-negative-by-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a committed approach to sustainability</a>, would phase the chemicals out as well.
