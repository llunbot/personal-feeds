The latest shakeup in the boardroom comes as the team (and dog) argued over the new color for the Pivot Firebird. Blue? White? Why not both?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In all seriousness, the new Limited Edition colorway is inspired by the Leatt team kits. Less than 100 of the limited edition PFR Firebirds will be made, which is limited to the color, not the build. The builds can be chosen from existing options including Shimano and SRAM drivetrains with Fox air, coil, or Live Valve suspension options. Depending on the build, pricing ranges from $9,399 to $12,099.
