But where did this terminology come from, and how are vintage dirt drops wildly different from what we have today? Using his 1983 <a href=\"https://www.stevepottsbicycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Potts</a> as a platform for discussion, John unfurled the unique history behind this bike and looked at a proper 1980s dirt drop setup. Let’s check it out.</em><span></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-85.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-85.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-85.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-85.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-85.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>An Ergonomics Argument</h3>\n<p>In Mike Varley’s 1991 “<a href=\"https://theradavist.com/mike-varleys-dropping-in-article-from-1991/\" target=\"_blank\">Dropping In</a>” article we posted yesterday, he argued that dirt drops offer superior handling and ergonomics off-road compared to flat bars. In short, when your hands are in a dirt drop, they are bent at 45º, versus 0º on a flat bar or 90º on road bike drops.</p>\n<p>This 45º position tucks your elbows inward slightly from the flat bar position, putting less strain on your wrist, as your arms act as shock absorbers. Try this sitting at your desk right now by rotating your hands from flat to 45º to 90º and notice where you feel the strain.</p>\n<p>As Mike stated in “Dropping In”:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“With your hands in the drops, the stress is taken off the carpal bones. This is achieved by allowing your elbows and forearms to act as shock absorbers, whereas the shocks on a flat bar are your wrists.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Mike-from-Black-Mountain-Cycles-Cunningham-53.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Mike-from-Black-Mountain-Cycles-Cunningham-53.jpg?w=1600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Mike-from-Black-Mountain-Cycles-Cunningham-53.jpg?resize=1024,1280&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Mike-from-Black-Mountain-Cycles-Cunningham-53.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Mike-from-Black-Mountain-Cycles-Cunningham-53.jpg?resize=1335,1669&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Mike-from-Black-Mountain-Cycles-Cunningham-53.jpg?resize=700,875&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Mike-from-Black-Mountain-Cycles-Cunningham-53.jpg?resize=1229,1536&amp;quality=75 1229w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Mike-from-Black-Mountain-Cycles-Cunningham-1.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Mike-from-Black-Mountain-Cycles-Cunningham-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Mike-from-Black-Mountain-Cycles-Cunningham-1.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Mike-from-Black-Mountain-Cycles-Cunningham-1.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Mike-from-Black-Mountain-Cycles-Cunningham-1.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Mike-from-Black-Mountain-Cycles-Cunningham-1.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Mike-from-Black-Mountain-Cycles-Cunningham-1.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Mike-from-Black-Mountain-Cycles-Cunningham-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>During an in-person discussion <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/mike-from-black-mountain-cycles-cunningham-e5-gh-road/\" target=\"_blank\">Mike and I had in 2023 when I swung by for a visit</a> and shot his Cunningham road bike, we discussed how this optimizes shoulders, arms, wrists, and hands for off-road impacts. He mentioned how your hands are more secure when locked into the dirt drop riding position versus on a flat bar, too.</p>\n<p>The main difference between proper dirt drops on a mountain bike and drop bars on a road bike is that dirt drops are ridden high up, in line with the rider’s saddle, putting the rider’s hands in the same position as when they’re on flat bars. With road drops, they are setup with more saddle-to-bar drop for “aero” riding. On a dirt drop mountain bike, you are still riding upright like a mountain bike, just in the drops.</p>\n<p>The idea of the classic dirt drop was to always be in the drops. Aside from longer climbs, riders would remain in the drops at all times, only momentarily resting their hands on the tops of the bars. In fact, it’s not ideal – or at least very uncomfortable – to put your hands on the hoods of a classic dirt drop setup and ride.</p>\n<p>This is a key differentiator between how people ride dirt drops in today’s context. On modern gravel bikes, which are just road bikes, riders spend most of their time on the hoods and flats of the bars, descending in the drops. On a proper drop bar mountain bike, your ideal riding position is riding in the drops most of the time.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-93.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-93.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-93.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-93.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-93.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-14.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-14.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-14.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-14.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-14.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-77.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-77.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-77.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-77.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-77.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The early dirt drops were hand-flared aluminum Cinelli Criterium or Campione Del Mondo racing bars, but later, WTB made the RM-2 with Specialized, pictured above, along with many other versions of the dirt drop.

Scot Nicol from <a href=\"https://www.ibiscycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ibis Cycles</a> was the first to make the “limp dick” stem, or LD stem. He was working with Cunningham and Potts at the time. In his early days with WTB, he was Charlie’s “gofor” – Charlie didn’t want to drive a car, ever, so Scot was picking up roller cam brakes from Richmond, California, dropping off frames to get painted, and running other sorts of “shop help” errands.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/History-of-Mountain-Bike-Evolution-Show-27.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/History-of-Mountain-Bike-Evolution-Show-27.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/History-of-Mountain-Bike-Evolution-Show-27.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/History-of-Mountain-Bike-Evolution-Show-27.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/History-of-Mountain-Bike-Evolution-Show-27.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Scot’s 1982 Ibis, documented in our “<a href=\"https://theradavist.com/history-of-mountain-bike-evolution-show/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle Taxonomy</a>” Reportage…</em></p>\n<p>When Scot founded Ibis Cycles in 1981, he began building bikes akin to what his mentors were making but with his own spin. When the dirt drop fad set in Scot began tinkering with the high-rise LD stems, making what is said to be the first.

This meant the top tubes were high, and the bikes were fitted with a “grip” seatpost.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Breezer-Series-I-2.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Breezer-Series-I-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Breezer-Series-I-2.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Breezer-Series-I-2.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Breezer-Series-I-2.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Breezer-Series-I-2.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Breezer-Series-I-2.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Breezer-Series-I-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/1978-breezer-series-i/\" target=\"_blank\">Breezer Series I</a></em></p>\n<p>The bikes from the early 1980s are visual perfection: 26″ wheels with fat tires, a grip of seatpost, slack angles, (sometimes) custom stems, built with a mix of global components.

Very similar to my <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/1985-steve-potts/\" target=\"_blank\">1985 Signature</a>. At the time, he had just begun working for Specialized and soon managed the Stumpjumper racing team. He rode the Potts for a while – note the Specialized logo on the top tube – before deciding that he hated how the roller cam brakes rode.
