Users can only listen back to Spaces that hosts have actively selected to be recorded.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSome hosts on Android and iOS now have the ability to record their Spaces by tapping \"Record Space\" before selecting \"Start a Space,\" allowing all users to listen to it even once it has finished. Users who join a Space that is being recorded will see a \"Rec\" button with a red dot at the top of the Space view, and once it has ended, users can share the recording on Twitter.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Some updates on recorded Spaces:<br /><br />▪️ The option to record a Space is available for some hosts on both iOS and Android.<br />▪️ The option to listen to a recording of a Space is available for everyone on iOS, Android, and now web!</p>— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1467986249852063748?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 6, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPreviously, Spaces only functioned as live audio discussions with no ability to listen again once it had ended.
