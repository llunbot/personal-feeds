Now you can barely avoid the symbol widely known as the hashtag and ubiquitous on social media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The PC keyboard has a dedicated hash key. But how do you type a hash or hashtag symbol on a Mac? Well, that depends on your keyboard layout. For readers using the standard U.S. layout, it’s pretty simple, and we’ll cover those guys later in this article. But we’ll mainly be focusing on the U.K., where this is a little trickier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to type a hashtag sign (#) in the U.K.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s not mess around. To type a hashtag on a Mac keyboard with a U.K. layout, press <strong>Option + 3</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On modern editions of this keyboard layout, you’ll see the # symbol on the 3 key, but instead of appearing above the 3, which would tell you to press the Shift key, it’s tucked away on the right. That means you should use Option. (The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670647/what-is-the-option-key-on-a-mac.html\">Option key</a> is sometimes known as Alt, by the way.)</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mac-UK-keyboard-layout.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Mac UK keyboard layout\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mac-UK-keyboard-layout.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mac-UK-keyboard-layout.jpg?resize=300%2C180&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mac-UK-keyboard-layout.jpg?resize=768%2C461&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>U.K. keyboards have to relegate the # to the number 3’s Option slot, because we need the Shift slot for our glorious British pound sign.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>On some older keyboards, however, you’ll find that the number 3 key only has the pound sign. Don’t be put off: pressing Option + 3 will still work on such keyboards. It’s just that in those days, the hash sign wasn’t viewed as such an important character. (You may also find that your older Mac keyboard labels the Option key as Alt.)</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3688542/mac-keyboard_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Mac Keyboard UK\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>Alt?

To type a hashtag sign, hit <strong>Shift + 3</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because U.S. readers have less need for the pound sign, the hash sign gets higher billing: it’s the secondary option for the 3 key. (On U.K. keyboards, as we’ve seen, typing Shift + 3 would give you £.)</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mac-US-keyboard-layout.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Mac US keyboard layout\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mac-US-keyboard-layout.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mac-US-keyboard-layout.jpg?resize=300%2C180&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mac-US-keyboard-layout.jpg?resize=768%2C461&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>You’ll notice that the euro sign has also disappeared.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>For more keyboard tips, see <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671016/how-type-at-euro-hash-special-characters-mac.html\">How to type Æ, €, #, @, © and other special characters on a Mac</a>.</p>\n\nMac, Personal Software</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5e05591462bc9e2061117aa103266342f6d2845b0c52fbfe23abe9f61ecf77b1","category":"Apple"}
