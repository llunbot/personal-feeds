This region will have three Availability Zones and will give AWS customers in New Zealand the ability to run workloads and store data that must remain in-country.</p> \n<p>There are 81 Availability Zones within 25 AWS Regions in operation today, with 24 more Availability Zones and eight announced regions (including this one) underway.</p> \n<p>Each of the Availability Zones will be physically independent of the others in region, close enough to support applications that need low latency, yet sufficiently distant to significantly reduce the risk that an AZ-level event will have an impact on business continuity. The AZs in this region will be connected together via high-bandwidth, low-latency network connections over dedicated, fully redundant fiber. This connectivity supports applications that need synchronous replication between AZs for availability or redundancy; you can take a peek at the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/\">AWS Global Infrastructure</a> page to learn more about how we design and build regions and AZs.</p> \n<p><span><strong>AWS in New Zealand</strong></span><br /> According to an economic impact study (EIS) that we released as part of this launch, we estimate that our NZ$ 7.5 billion (5.3 billion USD) investment will create 1,000 new jobs and will have an estimated economic impact of NZ$ 10.8 billion (7.7 billion USD) over the next fifteen years.</p> \n<p>The first AWS office in New Zealand opened in 2013 and now employs over 100 solution architects, account managers, sales representatives, professional services consultants, and cloud experts.</p> \n<p>Other AWS infrastructure includes a pair of Amazon CloudFront edge locations in Auckland along with access to the AWS global backbone through multiple, redundant submarine cables.
