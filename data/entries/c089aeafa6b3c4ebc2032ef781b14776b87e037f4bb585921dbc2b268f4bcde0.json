To encourage adoption, the vast majority of new Windows development is happening in Windows 11, which will get <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/biggest-windows-11-update-in-2-years-nearly-finalized-enters-release-preview/\">one of its biggest updates since release</a> sometime this fall.</p>\n\n<p>But Windows 10 is casting a long shadow. It remains the most-used version of Windows by all publicly available metrics, including <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide\">Statcounter</a> (where Windows 11's growth has been largely stagnant all year) and the <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam\">Steam Hardware Survey</a>. And last November, Microsoft decided to release a fairly major batch of Windows 10 updates that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/microsoft-is-revisiting-windows-10-by-backporting-the-copilot-ai-assistant/\">introduced the Copilot chatbot</a> and other changes to the aging operating system.</p>\n<p>And that may not be the end of the road. Microsoft has <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/06/04/opening-the-beta-channel-for-windows-insiders-on-windows-10/\">announced</a> that it is reopening a Windows Insider Beta Channel for PCs still running Windows 10, which will be used to test \"new features and more improvements to Windows 10 as needed.\" Users can opt into the Windows 10 Beta Channel regardless of whether their PC meets the requirements for Windows 11; if your PC is compatible, signing up for the less-stable Dev or Canary channels will still upgrade your PC to Windows 11.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029081#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029081&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c089aeafa6b3c4ebc2032ef781b14776b87e037f4bb585921dbc2b268f4bcde0","category":"Tech"}
