{"title":"We bought the first iPhone SE 4 case. Here’s what we learned","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2610872/iphone-se-4-what-does-the-first-case-tell-us.html","date":1739812563000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The 4th-gen iPhone SE 4 is almost certainly going to be unveiled on February 19. That’s not baseless speculation: the clues come directly from Apple, with Tim Cook himself promising that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2608238/apple-to-release-newest-member-of-the-family-on-february-19.html\">newest member of the family</a> will arrive on Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We should acknowledge, however, that pundits were saying <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2601977/the-new-iphone-se-launch-might-be-just-days-away.html\">something similar</a> last week, and obviously the new phone didn’t appear. In fact, likely prompted by those optimistic rumors, third-party vendors have already started offering cases for the iPhone SE 4… or the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2566753/why-apples-bizarre-iphone-se-name-change-actually-makes-sense.html\">iPhone 16e</a>, depending on which manufacturer you ask.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We bought one of these cases from a <a href=\"https://www.deindesign.de/de/handyhuellen/apple-iphone-16e.html\">German firm</a> while researching the iPhone SE 4 and have since received it. We’re happy to share this case and its secrets with you now, but please note that all information should be taken with a grain of salt, as the manufacturer explains:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We currently use the designation “iPhone 16e” based on information provided to us by our suppliers and various sources. These designations are not officially confirmed and are based on industry speculation and preliminary information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the designs, as with the names, we are dependent on information and speculation from our suppliers and sources. This information is therefore not always reliable or definitive and is always subject to change or adjustment.</p>\n<cite>DeinDesign (translated automatically from German)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>With that caveat out of the way, let’s take a look at the case and see what it has to tell us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, there’s a horizontal cut-out for the camera. If that makes you think we’re getting two camera lenses on the rear, think again: this is just to accommodate a single lens and a flash next to it, as is the case on the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/624052/iphone-se-2022-review.html\">2022 iPhone SE</a>. It’s been widely rumored that the 16e will be based on the chassis of the iPhone 14, but if Apple was going to use the design of that device’s camera module and diagonally arranged twin lenses it would be necessary to include a much larger square cutout. Most pundits agree that regardless of the chassis design, the new SE will have only one camera lens on the rear.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><ul><li><figure><img alt=\"Dein Design Hülle für das iPhone 16e oder SE 4\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone_se_4_deindesign_clear_silicone_2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Your design case for the iPhone 16e or SE 4 – horizontal camera cut-out</p>\n</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Dein Design Hülle für das iPhone 16e oder SE 4\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone_se_4_deindesign_clear_silicone_5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Your design case for the iPhone 16e or SE 4 – speaker and USB-C connector</p>\n</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Dein Design Hülle für das iPhone 16e oder SE 4\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone_se_4_deindesign_clear_silicone_3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Your design case for the iPhone 16e or SE 4 – side button</p>\n</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Dein Design Hülle für das iPhone 16e oder SE 4\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone_se_4_deindesign_clear_silicone_4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Your design case for iPhone 16e or SE 4 – Mute switch and volume buttons.</p>\n</figcaption></figure></li></ul><a></a><a></a><a></a><div></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, the case sticks to the standard and familiar iPhone design elements: there are cut-outs for speakers and connectors on the bottom edge and for the mute switch and volume buttons on the left. There’s an area for the side button on the righthand side, but the case gives no reason to expect the 16e to feature the Camera Control from the iPhone 16.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The clear silicone case from DeinDesign is a few millimeters narrower and shorter than an iPhone 14 case, which goes against the general consensus that Apple would use the iPhone 14 chassis for the upcoming iPhone SE. A few millimeters may not sound significant, but for smartphones, a difference of just one millimeter can mean that a case doesn’t fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><ul><li><figure><img alt=\"Dein Design Hülle für das iPhone 16e oder SE 4\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone_se_4_deindesign_clear_silicone_10.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Your design case for the iPhone 16e or SE 4 – narrower than a case for the iPhone 14</p>\n</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Dein Design Hülle für das iPhone 16e oder SE 4\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone_se_4_deindesign_clear_silicone_9.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Your design case for the iPhone 16e or SE 4 – shorter than a case for the iPhone 14</p>\n</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Dein Design Hülle für das iPhone 16e oder SE 4\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone_se_4_deindesign_clear_silicone_6.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Your design case for the iPhone 16e or SE 4 is about 70 mm wide</p>\n</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Dein Design Hülle für das iPhone 16e oder SE 4\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone_se_4_deindesign_clear_silicone_7.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Your design case for the iPhone 16e or SE 4 is 145 mm long.</p>\n</figcaption></figure></li></ul><a></a><a></a><a></a><div></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, the discrepancies in size make us skeptical as to whether the case we’ve purchased will fit the upcoming iPhone at all. Apple uses elements from previous generations for its entry-level models for cost reasons: the production lines are tried and tested after years of manufacture, and it will cost money to make even small changes. An iPhone 14 chassis could be manufactured at zero cost in terms of research, development and quality assurance; a slightly different chassis is another matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, iPhone dimensions have barely changed in years. The iPhone 12, 13 and 14 were all 146.7 mm long and 71.5 mm wide; the iPhone 15 and 16 were the same length and just 0.1mm wider. Significant change now feels unlikely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our alleged iPhone 16e case measures approximately 148 mm by 75 mm, a good deal smaller than a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRTH2ZM/A/otterbox-lumen-series-case-with-magsafe-for-iphone-16-pink\">comparable OtterBox clear case</a> for the iPhone 16, which measures 151.7 mm by 77.2 mm. Based on these measurements, we’re worried that we might have to send the case back to the manufacturer. Or maybe Apple is in the mood for radical change after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll find out for sure on Wednesday.
