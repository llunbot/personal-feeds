I’ve often wondered what to do with all of the coolness that people write, and while I share a lot of it on <a href=\"https://x.com/dcrainmakerblog\">Twitter/X</a> and <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/dcrainmaker.com\">BlueSky</a>, this is a better forum for sending it on to y’all. Most times these different streams don’t overlap, so be on the lookout at all these places for good stuff!</p>\n<p>So with that, let’s get into the action!</p>\n<h3><strong><span>DCR Posts In The Past Week:</span></strong></h3>\n<p>Here’s all the latest posts on the site:</p>\n<p>Tuesday: <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/04/garmin-varia-vue-light-camera-review.html\">Garmin Varia Vue Front Camera/Light In-Depth Review: Worth the Price?</a></p>\n<p>Thursday: <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/04/wahoo-bolt3-roam-3-hands-on-details-comparison-to-ace.html\">Wahoo BOLT 3 &amp; ROAM 3 Hands-On: What You Need to Know!</a></p>\n<p>Friday: <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/04/polar-launches-premium-subscription-service-says-hold-my-beer.html\">Polar Launches Premium Subscription Service: Says Hold My Beer</a></p>\n<p>Friday: <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/04/wahoo-trackr-radar-cycling-details.html\">Wahoo TRACKR RADAR Hands-On: All The Details</a></p>\n<h3><strong>YouTube Videos This Week:</strong></h3>\n<p>Here’s what hit the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dcrainmakerblog\">tubes over on the You of Tube</a>, definitely don’t forget to subscribe there to get notified of videos the second they hit!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<h3><span><strong>Stuff I Found Interesting Around The Interwebs:</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Here’s a not-so-small smattering of all the random things that I stumbled on while doing my civic duty to find the end of the Internet:</p>\n<p><strong>1) <a href=\"https://forums.garmin.com/beta-program/fenix-8-series/f/announcements/409074/beta-version-15-22---available-ota\">Rucking Support on Instinct 3, Fenix 8 Public Beta’s:</a> </strong>The Fenix 8 got this in public betas a number of weeks ago, while the <a href=\"https://forums.garmin.com/beta-program/instinct-3/f/announcements/409088/beta-version-9-07---available-ota\">Instinct 3 just got it this week</a>. This allows you to set pack weight. However, keep in mind this won’t change calories or other physiological metrics, since, in theory, those are accounted for via higher heart rates with more weight. I say ‘in theory’, because while that might be true, muscular impacts aren’t taken into account (e.g. a 20kg pack adds a ton more impact to your legs), but then again, muscular load has never been accounted for in Garmin’s training status related metrics.</p>\n<p><strong>2) <a href=\"https://www.polar.com/en/journal/the-wild-issue\">Latest Polar Journal Tackles Rucking Calorie Burn:</a> </strong>This is their online magazine of sorts, and is surprisingly good, usually with tons of research-backed links. In this episode, there’s an <a href=\"https://www.polar.com/en/journal/walking-weighted-vest\">entire article</a> that refers to the previous item of pack weight and vest weight. Go forth and…enjoy reading.</p>\n<p><strong>3) <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/13/trump-commerce-chief-says-not-like-a-permanent-sort-of-exemption-for-phones-computers.html\">A New Tarrif Gap for Sports Tech?</a></strong> Quite possibly. We’ll have to see once people can make sense of this latest twist, but it could provide an opening for sports tech to not have dramatic price increases that have already begun. Of course, it’s unlikely this will keep new products from being introduced at lower/planned prices, given the uncertainty of what might come. Companies are already choosing to launch at higher prices. Virtually all Bluetooth/WiFi/Cellular enabled watches and other tech <a href=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/bulletins/gd/USDHSCBP-3db9e55?wgt_ref=USDHSCBP_WIDGET_2\">would be covered by the new order</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4) <a href=\"https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/15250403#zippy=%2Chow-do-i-turn-on-loss-of-pulse-detection\">Google Rolls out Loss of Pulse Detection Feature in the US</a>:</strong> This was approved by the FDA back in February, and will <a href=\"https://research.google/blog/loss-of-pulse-detection-on-the-google-pixel-watch-3/\">detect if your pulse stops</a>, and automatically alert emergency services. You’ll need to opt-in to this, to get started.</p>\n<p><strong>5) <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/642950/gopro-hack-bird-conservation-bermuda-cahow\">Very very very old GoPro’s reused for bird watching:</a></strong> That’s some crazy dedication to making these old cameras work.</p>\n<p><strong>6) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrEcvK0DSrM\">Tweaked Fat Bikes vs Amsterdam Police:</a> </strong>While this is in Dutch, you can get the vast majority of it via the automatic YouTube subtitle translation option. Notably, on this day of testing bikes, they tested 250 fat bikes, and about 35 of them were modified to exceed the limits. And yes, the Amsterdam police have an on-staff vlogging officer, with half a million subscribers. Seems like a pretty solid community outreach ROI if you ask me.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>7) <a href=\"https://escapecollective.com/what-power-data-tells-us-about-the-womens-tour-of-flanders-2025/\">Power Data from the Women’s Tour of Flanders:</a> </strong>I love me some real pro race power data, and this breakdown doesn’t disappoint.</p>\n<p>–</p>\n<p>With that – thanks for reading!</p>","author":"Ray Maker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"97f462677d47c77fb53d5da4485d7c6b63969cb5e5487db9eb2df45021934d14","category":"Cycling"}
