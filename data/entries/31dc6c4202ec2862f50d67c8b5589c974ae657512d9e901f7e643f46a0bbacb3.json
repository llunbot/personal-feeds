It can cause one side of the display to look as if it's responding faster than the other side, a visual disturbance that's hard to miss once you notice it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says the phenomenon is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/28/apple-jelly-scrolling-normal-behavior/\">normal behavior</a> for LCD iPads. Since LCD screens refresh line by line, there is a tiny delay between when the lines at the top and lines at the bottom are refreshed. But while this may be normal behavior for LCD screens, it can appear more obvious when observed on the ‌‌iPad mini's smaller screen‌‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLate last year, a rumor on Korean forums suggested Apple was testing a Samsung-supplied display for a future ‌‌iPad mini‌‌ that would allow for up to 120Hz refresh rates, but no such model has been forthcoming, and Apple's plans for the iPad mini are still unclear, and rumors of an update have only gathered pace over the last couple of months. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/08/airpods-apple-watch-ipad-apple-tv-2023/\">reported</a> that an iPad mini update with a minor \"spec bump\" is not out of the question in 2024. More recently in August, the leaker known as \"ShrimpApplePro\" <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/01/ipad-mini-7-could-be-coming-later-this-year/\">suggested</a> a seventh-generation iPad mini was in the works at Apple, and said that they had seen evidence that at least one new iPad model is coming this year. A <em>DigiTimes</em> report last month <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/apple-ipad-mini-7-release-late-2023/\">said</a> Apple plans to release a \"small-sized iPad\" in the fourth quarter, while <em>9to5Mac</em> just last week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/apple-two-ipad-air-models/\">said</a> that its sources believe the ‌iPad mini‌ 7 is coming \"soon.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf anything happens before the holidays, a chip upgrade may be the most likely feature of a new ‌iPad mini‌. The ‌sixth-generation iPad mini‌ currently contains the A15 Bionic chip, while the new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro use the A16 and A17 Pro chip, respectively. A minor spec bump could also include upgrades to the front and rear cameras, potentially bringing features like Photonic Engine to the ‌iPad‌ for the first time.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/ipad-mini-7-no-promotion-display/\">Upcoming iPad Mini 7 Still Rumored to Lack 120Hz ProMotion Display</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/upcoming-ipad-mini-7-still-rumored-to-lack-120hz-promotion-display.2407031/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"31dc6c4202ec2862f50d67c8b5589c974ae657512d9e901f7e643f46a0bbacb3","category":"Apple"}
