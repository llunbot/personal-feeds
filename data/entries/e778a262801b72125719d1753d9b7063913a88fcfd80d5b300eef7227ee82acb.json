DX Checkup is a service for developer tool startups. Their pitch is simple: devtool startups derive power from two sources:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The <em>technology</em> your team is building.</li>\n<li>The <em>humans</em> who adopt it, depend on it and multiply its impact.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The team behind DX Checkup built it to focus on that human connection, because it involves so much work across so many disciplines. It’s also worth the trouble: building a movement around your tools can transform how software gets made.</p>\n\n<p>DX Checkup is free and there’s nothing to sign up for. Click through, answer some questions, get suggestions on your opportunities. If you want deeper insight and capacity, just reach out to them.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/01/dx-checkup\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e778a262801b72125719d1753d9b7063913a88fcfd80d5b300eef7227ee82acb","category":"Tech"}
