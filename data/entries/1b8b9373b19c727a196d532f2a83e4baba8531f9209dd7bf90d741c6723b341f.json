Negotiations had stalled until US Secretary of Labor Julie Su stepped in, IAM said in a press release, helping to restart talks and get to a deal that 59 percent of workers could agree on.</p>\n<p>Under the <a href=\"http://www.iam751.org/2024StrikeProposal/\">proposed deal</a>, workers will receive a 43 percent wage increase over four years, as well as a $12,000 bonus they can choose to receive in their paycheck, as a 401(k) contribution, or a combination of both. Additionally, Boeing agreed to match 401(k) contributions up to 8 percent.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/boeing-workers-vote-to-end-9-6b-strike-nabbing-43-wage-increase-over-4-years/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/boeing-workers-vote-to-end-9-6b-strike-nabbing-43-wage-increase-over-4-years/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1b8b9373b19c727a196d532f2a83e4baba8531f9209dd7bf90d741c6723b341f","category":"Tech"}
