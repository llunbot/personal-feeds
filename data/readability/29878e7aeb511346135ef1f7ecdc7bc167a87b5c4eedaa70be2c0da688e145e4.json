In fact, you may find that unisex options fit better or that you prefer those styles. Typically, women’s cycling shoes run a bit narrower than men’s/unisex options and come in smaller sizes. So if you have a narrow foot or need a small size, you may need women’s MTB shoes.</p><p>Our favorite is the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=b5770911-39dc-46ac-ba0f-b49dbb30c5c7&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fgiro-cylinder-shoe-womens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Giro Cylinder</a>. The combination of Boa and Velcro for closure means your foot is firmly ensconced in the shoe no matter what happens on the ride. While it has a narrower fit, the upper isn’t unforgiving, making it a comfortable long ride shoe. And it’s racy enough for XC riders looking for performance but has enough give in the sole that it still feels beginner-friendly. In short, it’s a well-balanced shoe. Its pricing falls in the mid-range as well: At $240, you’re getting most of the benefits of a higher-end shoe.</p><p>It’s been around for a while, and while a basic black option is available, Giro also releases different colorways depending on what colors are trending. Cyclocrossers can rejoice, too: This shoe accepts screw-in toe spikes for muddy races.</p><ul><li>Type: Clipless</li><li>Closure system: Boa and Velcro</li><li>Sole: Nylon and rubber</li><li>Weight: 320 grams (size 39)</li><li>Sizes: 36 to 43 in whole sizes</li><li>Price: $240</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Comfortable while still being race-ready<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Pricey<br></p><h3><span>&nbsp;<strong>BEST MTB SHOE FOR TIGHT BUDGETS</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=92594cfb-2b30-40ba-ab76-f9c20ed4612c&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fshimano-sh-me4-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shimano SH-ME4 Mountain Bike Shoe</a>&nbsp;</span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29113915/shimano-me-4-mtb-shoe.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29113915/shimano-me-4-mtb-shoe.jpg\" alt=\"best MTB shoe: shimano me 4 \" width=\"1600\" height=\"919\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29113915/shimano-me-4-mtb-shoe.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29113915/shimano-me-4-mtb-shoe-297x171.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29113915/shimano-me-4-mtb-shoe-800x460.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29113915/shimano-me-4-mtb-shoe-120x69.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29113915/shimano-me-4-mtb-shoe-768x441.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29113915/shimano-me-4-mtb-shoe-1536x882.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29113915/shimano-me-4-mtb-shoe-696x400.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29113915/shimano-me-4-mtb-shoe-1068x613.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29113915/shimano-me-4-mtb-shoe-731x420.jpg 731w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29113915/shimano-me-4-mtb-shoe.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29113915/shimano-me-4-mtb-shoe.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29113915/shimano-me-4-mtb-shoe-297x171.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29113915/shimano-me-4-mtb-shoe-800x460.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29113915/shimano-me-4-mtb-shoe-120x69.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29113915/shimano-me-4-mtb-shoe-768x441.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29113915/shimano-me-4-mtb-shoe-1536x882.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29113915/shimano-me-4-mtb-shoe-696x400.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29113915/shimano-me-4-mtb-shoe-1068x613.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29113915/shimano-me-4-mtb-shoe-731x420.jpg 731w\"></a></p><p>Looking for a simple shoe with much of the tech behind Shimano’s S-Phyre options without the hefty price tag?

Like many MTB shoes, the closure is a combination of a Boa dial and Velcro straps to ensure that a crash into an errant rock doesn’t wreck your ride, even if it busts a Boa.</p><p>Note that these shoes are available in men’s and women’s options.

impossible not to mention the Five Ten brand when talking about flat shoes. They’re ubiquitous in the MTB, DH and BMX scene, and Bikerumor staffers love the comfort and stickiness of the Freerider with the grippy Dotty rubber tread.</p><p>These are perhaps the most ride-to-the-bar-friendly option in this roundup. Hit the trails, then head into town, and you’ll just look like you’re wearing casual sneakers. But they’re packed with features like a quick-drying upper, as well as a Stealth® S1™ sticky rubber outsole that allows you to stay optimally connected to your pedals despite no clips.</p><p>Available in both <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F872539%2Ffive-ten-freerider-mountain-bike-shoes-mens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">men’s</a> and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F113319%2Ffive-ten-freerider-mountain-bike-shoes-womens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">women’s</a> sizing, the Freerider has a few color options.

Compared to other flat shoes, these are much more flexible in the midsole thanks to an EVA foam insert for comfort and impact absorption, making them easier to walk in.</p><p><a

An internal shank keeps your foot protected and offers some shock absorption, though the cost is that these shoes are a bit less comfortable for casual walks around the neighborhood post-ride.

If you’re entering the gravel racing or cyclocross scene, a shoe that can handle the rigors of a mountain bike ride but can also be stiff and speedy like a road shoe is critical.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://lakecycling.com/products/mx-332\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MX332</a> is the racier model of more traditional Lake mountain bike shoes, so it’s lower profile with a slimmer fit and lighter weight. The carbon sole with rubber tread provides a stable surface for pedaling but is great for running as well, and there’s space for toe spikes if you’re into muddy rides or races. A temperature-regulating liner makes these leather shoes better than most for both hot and cooler rides.</p><p>Lake is well-known as the brand to choose for wide feet, and these shoes are no different: They have a wide size option. However, the regular version of the shoe is cut more narrow to be racer-optimized, so if you’re not a slim-footed person, opt for the wide.</p><ul><li>Type: Clipless</li><li>Closure system: Boas</li><li>Sole: Carbon and rubber</li><li>Weight: 370 grams for size 42</li><li>Sizes: 39 to 50 with the wide version available</li><li>Price: $450</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Great for racing gravel or cyclocross, wide sizes available<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Pricey<br></p><h3><span>&nbsp;<strong>BEST HIGH-END MTB SHOE</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.luck-bike.es/gb/luck-cycling-shoes/344-galaxy.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Luck Galaxy Custom MTB Shoes</a>&nbsp;</span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27110159/luck-mtb-shoes-custom.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27110159/luck-mtb-shoes-custom.jpg\" alt=\"Best mountain bike shoes: high end custom Luck Galaxy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1042\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27110159/luck-mtb-shoes-custom.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27110159/luck-mtb-shoes-custom-297x193.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27110159/luck-mtb-shoes-custom-800x521.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27110159/luck-mtb-shoes-custom-120x78.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27110159/luck-mtb-shoes-custom-768x500.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27110159/luck-mtb-shoes-custom-1536x1000.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27110159/luck-mtb-shoes-custom-696x453.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27110159/luck-mtb-shoes-custom-1068x696.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27110159/luck-mtb-shoes-custom-645x420.jpg 645w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27110159/luck-mtb-shoes-custom.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27110159/luck-mtb-shoes-custom.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27110159/luck-mtb-shoes-custom-297x193.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27110159/luck-mtb-shoes-custom-800x521.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27110159/luck-mtb-shoes-custom-120x78.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27110159/luck-mtb-shoes-custom-768x500.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27110159/luck-mtb-shoes-custom-1536x1000.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27110159/luck-mtb-shoes-custom-696x453.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27110159/luck-mtb-shoes-custom-1068x696.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27110159/luck-mtb-shoes-custom-645x420.jpg 645w\"></a></p><p>Want to spice up your shoes?

Are you focused on speed? Consider clipless. More comfort-based, or planning on doing bigger obstacles and downhill-styled riding? Flat shoes might suit you better.</p><p><strong>Measure your feet carefully</strong>. Cycling shoes can be a little tricky since they tend to be stiffer than regular sneakers, which means you’ll have less room for error.</p><p><strong>Make sure you try the shoes on with the socks you’ll be riding in.</strong> It sounds like a small thing, but sometimes your bike socks differ just enough from your everyday socks that they can change the fit and comfort of a shoe entirely.</p><p><strong>Walk and ride to test</strong>. Even if you’re looking at clipless shoes and not planning to spend a lot of your time hiking your bike, you likely will walk at some point. So find a shoe that feels relatively comfortable while walking as well as riding.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions about Mountain Bike Shoes</h2><p><strong>What do I need mountain bike shoes for?</strong><br>Other than the obvious—namely, mountain biking—MTB shoes have other uses. Clipless MTB shoes are often used for gravel riding and cyclocross racing, and if you use SPD cleats, you can even use your MTB shoes for spin classes.</p><p>Some people (including this editor) simply find that MTB shoes are more comfortable and easier to walk in than road shoes and will use MTB shoes rather than road shoes for all kinds of riding.</p><p>Flat shoes used with regular pedals can be used as skate shoes or shoes for dirt jumping or BMX riding.</p><div id=\"attachment_253095\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-253095\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two.jpg\" alt=\"specialized rime flat pedal mountain bike shoe review\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-253095\">Flat shoes make it easy to put a foot down and are ideal for downhill or enduro-style MTB riding.</p></div><p><strong>When would I need flat pedals versus clipless?</strong><br>If you’re serious about putting in big miles, clipless pedals allow you to be much more efficient with your pedal stroke. Gravel and cyclocross riders will typically use clipless MTB shoes, as will cross-country racers. More casual riders and those in gravity disciplines like downhill may prefer flat shoes.</p><p><strong>Do I need bike-specific flat shoes?</strong><br>When you get started, you may find that regular sneakers work just fine as mountain bike shoes when used with flat pedals. But as you progress, you’ll likely want to swap to bike-specific flat shoes, which have a rubber sole that’s stickier than your average shoe to stay more firmly planted on the pedals. The rubber is also more durable, so the small pins in your pedals that keep your feet in place won’t damage them.</p><div id=\"attachment_252784\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10084007/Specialized-2Fo-roost-dh-flat-pedal-shoes-low-rebound-rubberfanderson-017.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-252784\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10084007/Specialized-2Fo-roost-dh-flat-pedal-shoes-low-rebound-rubberfanderson-017.jpg\" alt=\"specialized 2fo roost dh slipnot rubber sole 3rd gen rubber\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10084007/Specialized-2Fo-roost-dh-flat-pedal-shoes-low-rebound-rubberfanderson-017.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10084007/Specialized-2Fo-roost-dh-flat-pedal-shoes-low-rebound-rubberfanderson-017-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10084007/Specialized-2Fo-roost-dh-flat-pedal-shoes-low-rebound-rubberfanderson-017-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10084007/Specialized-2Fo-roost-dh-flat-pedal-shoes-low-rebound-rubberfanderson-017-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10084007/Specialized-2Fo-roost-dh-flat-pedal-shoes-low-rebound-rubberfanderson-017-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10084007/Specialized-2Fo-roost-dh-flat-pedal-shoes-low-rebound-rubberfanderson-017-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10084007/Specialized-2Fo-roost-dh-flat-pedal-shoes-low-rebound-rubberfanderson-017-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10084007/Specialized-2Fo-roost-dh-flat-pedal-shoes-low-rebound-rubberfanderson-017-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10084007/Specialized-2Fo-roost-dh-flat-pedal-shoes-low-rebound-rubberfanderson-017.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10084007/Specialized-2Fo-roost-dh-flat-pedal-shoes-low-rebound-rubberfanderson-017.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10084007/Specialized-2Fo-roost-dh-flat-pedal-shoes-low-rebound-rubberfanderson-017-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10084007/Specialized-2Fo-roost-dh-flat-pedal-shoes-low-rebound-rubberfanderson-017-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10084007/Specialized-2Fo-roost-dh-flat-pedal-shoes-low-rebound-rubberfanderson-017-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10084007/Specialized-2Fo-roost-dh-flat-pedal-shoes-low-rebound-rubberfanderson-017-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10084007/Specialized-2Fo-roost-dh-flat-pedal-shoes-low-rebound-rubberfanderson-017-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10084007/Specialized-2Fo-roost-dh-flat-pedal-shoes-low-rebound-rubberfanderson-017-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10084007/Specialized-2Fo-roost-dh-flat-pedal-shoes-low-rebound-rubberfanderson-017-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-252784\">The rubber on an MTB-specific flat shoe is much grippier and sturdier than sneakers.</p></div><p><strong>How should a mountain bike shoe fit?</strong><br>Think about a running shoe and aim for that kind of feeling: Snug enough that your foot isn’t sliding around at all, but not so tight that your toes are crunched, or you can’t wiggle them slightly. Because mountain biking typically includes spending time off the bike, a shoe that feels comfortable to walk (or run, if you’re racing) in is important.</p><p><strong>Do I need carbon soles?</strong><br>It depends on the type of riding you’re hoping to do, but most recreational mountain bikers won’t need the added stiffness that carbon provides. If you are doing a lot of pedaling, though, that stiffness will help you transfer energy efficiently. Rubber will bend slightly with every pedal stroke, which will take away from the power you can produce.</p><div id=\"attachment_263126\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-263126\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes.jpg\" alt=\"giro cylinder mtb shoe\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes-1536x1152.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes-1068x801.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes-560x420.jpg 560w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes-265x198.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes-1536x1152.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes-1068x801.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes-560x420.jpg 560w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/27105140/giro-cylinder-best-mtb-shoes-265x198.jpg 265w\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-263126\">Narrow or small feet may be more comfortable in a women’s specific shoe.</p></div><p><strong>Do I need women-specific shoes?</strong><br>We only included one women’s-specific MTB shoe in this list, but women can easily wear any of the shoes on the list.

The shoes are also less slippery, so you’ll be less likely to wipe out on the slick gym floors.</p><div id=\"attachment_254787\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/07131443/Shimano-IC2-walkable-indoor-cycling-spinning-shoes_SPD-MTB-cleat.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-254787\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/07131443/Shimano-IC2-walkable-indoor-cycling-spinning-shoes_SPD-MTB-cleat.jpg\" alt=\"Shimano IC2 walkable indoor cycling spinning shoes\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1200\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/07131443/Shimano-IC2-walkable-indoor-cycling-spinning-shoes_SPD-MTB-cleat.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/07131443/Shimano-IC2-walkable-indoor-cycling-spinning-shoes_SPD-MTB-cleat-297x238.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/07131443/Shimano-IC2-walkable-indoor-cycling-spinning-shoes_SPD-MTB-cleat-800x640.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/07131443/Shimano-IC2-walkable-indoor-cycling-spinning-shoes_SPD-MTB-cleat-120x96.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/07131443/Shimano-IC2-walkable-indoor-cycling-spinning-shoes_SPD-MTB-cleat-768x614.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/07131443/Shimano-IC2-walkable-indoor-cycling-spinning-shoes_SPD-MTB-cleat-696x557.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/07131443/Shimano-IC2-walkable-indoor-cycling-spinning-shoes_SPD-MTB-cleat-1068x854.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/07131443/Shimano-IC2-walkable-indoor-cycling-spinning-shoes_SPD-MTB-cleat-525x420.jpg 525w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/07131443/Shimano-IC2-walkable-indoor-cycling-spinning-shoes_SPD-MTB-cleat.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/07131443/Shimano-IC2-walkable-indoor-cycling-spinning-shoes_SPD-MTB-cleat.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/07131443/Shimano-IC2-walkable-indoor-cycling-spinning-shoes_SPD-MTB-cleat-297x238.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/07131443/Shimano-IC2-walkable-indoor-cycling-spinning-shoes_SPD-MTB-cleat-800x640.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/07131443/Shimano-IC2-walkable-indoor-cycling-spinning-shoes_SPD-MTB-cleat-120x96.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/07131443/Shimano-IC2-walkable-indoor-cycling-spinning-shoes_SPD-MTB-cleat-768x614.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/07131443/Shimano-IC2-walkable-indoor-cycling-spinning-shoes_SPD-MTB-cleat-696x557.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/07131443/Shimano-IC2-walkable-indoor-cycling-spinning-shoes_SPD-MTB-cleat-1068x854.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/07131443/Shimano-IC2-walkable-indoor-cycling-spinning-shoes_SPD-MTB-cleat-525x420.jpg 525w\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-254787\">Spin shoes are not ideal for MTBers, but you can use an MTB shoe with SPD pedals in spin class. c.

Spin shoes typically will have a smoother, more rigid sole that isn’t designed for the rigors of mountain biking.</p><p><strong>Can I use mountain bike shoes as road shoes?</strong><br>Absolutely. In fact, plenty of road riders have shifted to mountain bike shoes now that gravel riding and adventure riding have risen in popularity. You might lose a bit of efficiency and be a bit less tightly connected to your bike, but if you’re more comfortable in mountain bike shoes or on a tight budget and can only afford to have one style of clipless pedals and shoes, opt for mountain bike shoes.</p><p>They’re also easier to wear when running errands, hitting the bar or getting off your bike to walk across a busy road.
