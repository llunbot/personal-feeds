{"title":"Spotify Wants to Use iPhone Volume Buttons to Control Connected Devices, But Refuses to Support AirPlay, Which Would Solve the Problem","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/29/spotify-points-finger-at-apple-over-an-unwelcome-change-to-volume-control-technology/","date":1725566019000,"content":"\n<p>Sarah Perez, writing for TechCrunch:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Spotify claims Apple may again be in violation of European\nregulation, the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which requires\ninteroperability from big technology companies dubbed\n“gatekeepers.” This time, the issue isn’t about in-app purchases,\nlinks or pricing information, but rather how Apple has\ndiscontinued the technology that allows Spotify users to control\nthe volume on their connected devices.</p>\n\n<p>When streaming to connected devices via Spotify Connect on iOS,\nusers were previously able to use the physical buttons on the side\nof their iPhone to adjust the volume. As a result of the change,\nthis will no longer work. To work around the issue, Spotify iOS\nusers will instead be directed to use the volume slider in the\nSpotify Connect menu in the app to control the volume on connected\ndevices.</p>\n\n<p>The company notes that this issue doesn’t affect users\ncontrolling the volume on iOS Bluetooth or AirPlay sessions, nor\nusers on Android. It only applies to those listening via Spotify\nConnect on iOS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Who should get to decide the rules for how the hardware volume buttons work on iPhones and iPads? Apple, or the European Commission?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/05/spotify-volume-buttons\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f5972cc64e45bdf7a2e7ba4521198b561343f085370f89bca53458c0a49c2023","category":"Tech"}
