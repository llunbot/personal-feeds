Do you, much like the rest of humanity, have a mother? Well, if you do, then this is the time of year when you're supposed to buy her something to make up for all the pain and suffering she went through in order to bring you into this world! Mom raised you, and while what your mother probably wants more than anything is for you to pick up the phone and <em>talk</em><em>,</em> you could do a lot worse than throwing some money at the problem and buying your mother something from the list we've assembled below!</p>\n<h2>Stuff for under $100</h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DWM3PCBN?linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=arstech20-20\"><em>Severance</em> TV show mug, $17.99</a></h3>\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"694\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/md2025_mug-1024x694.jpg\" alt=\"Photograph of a Severance-themed mug\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/md2025_mug-1024x694.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/md2025_mug-640x434.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/md2025_mug-768x521.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/md2025_mug-980x664.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/md2025_mug-1440x976.jpg 1440w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/md2025_mug.jpg 1500w\" />\n      From Allentown to Cold Harbor, discerning innies know the best way to drink beverages.\n        Credit:\n          Amazon\n      \n<p>Whether the mom in your life operates primarily as an \"innie\" or an \"outie,\" if she's a fan of the Apple TV+ show <em>Severance</em>, she may appreciate <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DWM3PCBN?linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=arstech20-20\">this ceramic coffee mug inspired by the series</a>. The mug features the iconic phrase \"The Work is Both Mysterious and Important\" in blue text that mirrors Lumon Industries' sterile corporate aesthetic. It's an ideal conversation starter for fans enjoying the show's second season after the painfully long production delay. Best of all, it's perfect for morning coffee before Mom begins her own mysterious and important work. The same company also offers a \"Woe's Hollow\" mug if you'd like an alternative design. Celebrate the Sisyphean every-day-is-the-same blessing of motherhood with confidence as these mugs are dishwasher and microwave safe, and they are available in both 11oz and 15oz sizes.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Frameo-Electronic-Auto-Rotate-Mountable-Instantly/dp/B088NHSVJN?linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=arstech20-20%20\">Frameo digital picture frame, $49.99</a></h3>\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"582\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/md2025_frame-1024x582.jpg\" alt=\"Photograph of a digital picture frame\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/md2025_frame-1024x582.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/md2025_frame-640x364.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/md2025_frame-768x436.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/md2025_frame-980x557.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/md2025_frame-1440x818.jpg 1440w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/md2025_frame.jpg 1500w\" />\n      Frame your mom!\n        Credit:\n          Amazon\n      \n<p>From awkward baby pictures, to wedding memories and last year’s holidays, your mother likely has more photos than she knows what to do with. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Frameo-Electronic-Auto-Rotate-Mountable-Instantly/dp/B088NHSVJN?linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=arstech20-20%20\">Frameo digital picture frames</a> give your mom somewhere to show off those countless photos without embarrassing, unexpected tags on Facebook.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/05/ars-technicas-gift-guide-for-mothers-day-give-mom-some-cool-things/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/05/ars-technicas-gift-guide-for-mothers-day-give-mom-some-cool-things/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2b246091d65241cad1baf76cc04b99a0de5f451f26db87232b07e90beb97fd9b","category":"Tech"}
