The updated version of Wahoo’s indoor cycling training desk is really just a few useful tweaks here and there, but lowering its price from $300 to $200 makes this feel like a much more viable option for cyclists looking to have a laptop or tablet, snacks &amp; drinks in reach while riding the indoor trainer through the off-season!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wahoo KICKR Desk v2 indoor cycling training desk</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_with-new-tablet-holder-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_with-new-tablet-holder-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Wahoo KICKR Desk v2 indoor cycling training desk\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_with-new-tablet-holder-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_with-new-tablet-holder-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_with-new-tablet-holder-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_with-new-tablet-holder-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_with-new-tablet-holder-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Wahoo)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Few products stick around in the cycling industry for a decade unchanged like the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wahoo-spins-out-a-standup-desk-for-use-with-their-kickr-snap-trainers/\">original</a> Wahoo Kickr Desk. And even fewer pop back up years later with added features and a lower price! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key feature of the Kickr Desk is its U-shaped base and adjustable height design that allows you to set the desk within reach however you prefer to ride on an indoor trainer. Keep it lower and just in front of or over your handlebar for when you ride leaned forward over the bike. Or pop it up higher and roll it back over the bike for easy access while sitting upright on your saddle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third use is actually without the bike involved at all, it’s said to function well as a standing desk, too!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of that functionality carries over unchanged.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So, what’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a

of recesses cut into the slip-resistance top to keep 2 water bottles from bouncing around as you ride, a new arrangement of wheels, new fold-away hooks, and a new optional add-on tablet holder.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_new-wheel-layout-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\"

– 2 fixed wheels closer to your bike and 2 swiveling casters, which Wahoo thinks will be both more stable and easier to rotate into perfect position as you ride vs. the old 3 fixed wheel layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_new-folding-wheel-hooks-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

designed to hang your wheel when you ride a trainer that has either the front removed (i.e. <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/eb15-feedback-sports-takes-omnium-roller-trainer-and-makes-it-better/\" target=\"_blank\">Feedback Omnium</a>), the rear wheel removed (any of the Kickr family with <a

<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wahoo-climb-lifts-lowers-fork-simulate-hills-kickr-updated-accordingly/\" target=\"_blank\">Kickr Climb</a> attached). Or just fold them closed if you are old school and riding rollers (even a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wahoo-kickr-rollr-indoor-bike-trainer-smart-rollers/\" target=\"_blank\">Kickr Rollr</a>) or have one of those fancy dedicated trainer machines, like a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/updated-wahoo-kickr-v6-indoor-cycle-trainer-kickr-bike-2-wifi/\" target=\"_blank\">Kickr Bike</a> or <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wahoo-drops-kickr-move-and-kickr-bike-shift-just-in-time-for-trainer-season/\" target=\"_blank\">Shift</a>. Or you could also have a dry towel there to soak up the sweat from your workout.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_new-tablet-mount-coming-soon-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_new-tablet-mount-coming-soon-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Wahoo KICKR Desk v2 indoor cycling training desk, new tablet stand coming soon\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_new-tablet-mount-coming-soon-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_new-tablet-mount-coming-soon-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_new-tablet-mount-coming-soon-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_new-tablet-mount-coming-soon-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_new-tablet-mount-coming-soon-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_new-tablet-mount-coming-soon-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_new-tablet-mount-coming-soon-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, there’s also a couple of new holes in the back to slot in an add-on tablet holder that sits out beyond the desk, in the style of the Kickr Run treadmill’s device rest. The trick here is that the new tablet accessory is not available yet (<em>but it’s “coming soon”</em>). So, we don’t know how much more it will cost, or when exactly. So in the meantime, you can just angle your tablet into either the front or rear slots like you always have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wahoo also says there’s some new cable management, although I don’t see anything different there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>widely adjustable height: raise or lower the desk to sitting, riding, or standing positions </li>\n\n\n\n<li>desk height 35-47″ (88-119cm) from the floor</li>\n\n\n\n<li>font &amp; rear built-in tablet or smartphone slots</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>new</em> 4 wheels for easier movement &amp; stability</li>\n\n\n\n<li>slip-resistant rubber desk surface</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>new</em> 2 folding wheel hangers</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>new</em> 2 bottle recesses</li>\n\n\n\n<li>cable management loops at the rear corners</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>new</em> add-on tablet stand (<em>coming soon</em>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>27.5″ wide x 29.5″ base (69.8 x 74.9cm)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>28″x14″ desktop (71.1 x 35.6cm)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>weighs 25.5lb (11.6kg)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>max rated desk load of 50lb (22.67kg)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wahoo Kickr Desk v2 – Pricing &amp; availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_angled-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_angled-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Wahoo KICKR Desk v2 indoor cycling training desk, complete\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_angled-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_angled-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_angled-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_angled-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-KICKR-Desk-v2-indoor-cycling-training-desk_angled-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The newly updated Wahoo Kickr Desk v2 indoor trainer table now sells for $200 / 200€.
