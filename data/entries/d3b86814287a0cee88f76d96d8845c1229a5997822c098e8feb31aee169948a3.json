It clearly did. But it has left us with an awkward question: What exactly did that past look like? Some results argue that there were <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/03/enormous-martian-ocean-evaporated-into-space/\">long-lived oceans</a> and lakes on Mars. Others argue that the water largely consisted of ice-covered bodies that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/02/early-mars-didnt-have-enough-co2-to-keep-water-liquid-curiosity-finds/\">only allowed water</a> to burst out onto the surface <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/11/remarkably-little-evidence-of-water-where-perseverance-rover-landed/\">on occasions</a>.</p>\n<p>The picture is further confused by the fact that some or all of these may have been true at different times or in different locations. Creating a clear picture would help shape our understanding of an environment that might have been far more conducive to life than anything that exists on present-day Mars.</p>\n<p>A new paper describes evidence that at least one part of Mars went through many wet/dry cycles, which may be critical for the natural production of molecules essential to life on Earthâ€”though they don't necessarily mean conditions in which life itself could thrive.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959934#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959934&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d3b86814287a0cee88f76d96d8845c1229a5997822c098e8feb31aee169948a3","category":"Tech"}
