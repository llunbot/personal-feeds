It is still possible that Apple could brand its iPhone 16 chips as the A17 and A18 Pro, mirroring recent years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPu was the first source to report that Apple had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/06/iphone-16-pro-solid-state-buttons-low-chance/\">abandoned its plans for solid-state buttons</a> on the iPhone 15 Pro models.
