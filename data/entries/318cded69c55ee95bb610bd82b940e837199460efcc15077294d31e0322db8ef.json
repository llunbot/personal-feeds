Crowds are lining the finishing straight along the Avenida de Asturias eagerly awaiting the climax of the 54th edition of the Women’s World Championships Road Race. The leading group of four are approaching the final kilometre with nine women just behind, chasing furiously. Spectators crane their necks, wave flags and bang on the barriers in anticipation of what the next minute or so of racing might bring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some three and a half hours earlier, 134 riders had set out, ahead of them a 127.4km race comprising seven laps of an 18.2km circuit featuring two climbs: the Alto de Montearenas – 5.2km at 3.5% but with early gradients of 8% – followed by the Alto de Compostilla – 1.1km at 6.6% with a maximum gradient of 10%. In between were sharp descents, including a maximum drop of 16%, and 6km or so of relatively flat roads.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The early phase of the race had been dominated by a sickening crash on the descent of the Compostilla. With around 94km to go, a falling rider near the front of the bunch caused a ripple effect through the peloton. Fifty-four riders were caught up in the resultant crashes, with many needing medical attention, reducing the main bunch to just 77 riders by start of the third lap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rain started to fall as three-time and defending World Champion Marianne Vos moved to the front at the foot of the Compostilla, keen to control affairs as she descended on wet roads. Sweden’s Emma Johansson then attacked on the climb, with a little over 5km to the finish. Vos immediately followed along with Italy’s Elisa Longo Borghini and Britain’s Lizzie Armitstead, forming a leading group of four over the top of the climb, with France’s Pauline Ferrand-Prévot leading the chasers four seconds behind.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/jeannie-longo-coors-classic\">Pro race history: Jeannie Longo wins America’s biggest race in 1985</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/marianne-vos-2006-world-championships\">Pro race history: Marianne Vos wins her first world title in 2006</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/beryl-burton-1960-worlds\">Pro race history: Beryl Burton wins her first road Worlds in 1960</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>The denouement</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the clock nudging half past five and the crowds lining the Avenida de Asturias, the race is about to enter its final moments. The four leading riders are still out front, now with a 12-second lead. As the last kilometre approaches Longo Borghini tries a move, knowing she will not prevail in a sprint. Vos leads the chase to bring her back, the group reforms and their pace slows dramatically. Vos looks back. Armitstead looks back. Johansson looks back. Vos talks to Longo Borghini and looks back again. Longo Borghini looks back herself, as does Vos, again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Armitstead decides all this looking back is no good and goes to the front. She wants to lift the pace and not let the chasers back into contention, not least because this group includes the 2010 and 2011 World Champion, Giorgia Bronzini of Italy, and Germany’s Lisa Brennauer, who claimed the World Time-Trial crown just four days ago. But no one joins Armitstead’s effort; they are resigned to the fact that the group are going to catch them. In the commentary booths no one can quite believe it as the catch is made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the bunch for the sprint is 15 strong. With 300m to go Bronzini makes her move but Vos strikes back and hits the front herself, hugging the left-hand barrier. And there, lurking on the Dutchwoman’s wheel, is Ferrand-Prévot, who has picked the defending champion as the woman to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 200m to go she comes off the wheel and draws level on Vos’s right shoulder. Now Vos falls away, spent. Ferrand-Prévot opens her sprint, veering right across the road in the final 100m. With 50m to go four women are lined up across the road: Ferrand-Prévot, Brennauer, Johansson and Bronzini. Heads down, legs pumping, lungs burning, it’s incredibly close but as they hit the line Ferrand-Prévot looks across and throws a somewhat tentative arm in the air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I didn’t know I won at first but now I know and it is fantastic,’ Ferrand-Prévot says afterwards, before reflecting that her win had come after a hard week: ‘I didn’t expect to be the first today. I crashed on Sunday and I felt very bad this week.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+8\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>That’s just the first instalment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ferrand-Prévot’s win came at the end of what had been an exceptional season for the Frenchwoman. Her first win on the road in 2014 had come in the Flèche Wallonne Classic, where she hit the front with just 50m to the line on the savagely steep Mur de Huy to claim what, at the time, was the biggest win of her road career. She followed that with the time-trial and road race titles at the French Nationals before claiming that rainbow jersey in Ponferrada, becoming the first Frenchwoman to win the World Championships Road Race since Jeannie Longo in 1995.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That win opened the floodgates. Always a multi-discipline rider, just four months later Ferrand-Prévot won the Cyclocross Worlds in Tábor, Czech Republic, and then in September 2015 took the cross-country title at the Mountain Bike Worlds in Vallnord, Andorra. It meant that, remarkably, for a short time in September 2015 Ferrand-Prévot held the rainbow jersey in three individual elite events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘People wanted to put me in one category, I think because it was easier for them,’ Ferrand-Prévot said in 2015. ‘The French federation was not so happy because they wanted me to make a choice. But I said no. Now with all my world titles I am very happy because I can say to all those people that what I chose to do was good for me.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward a decade from those Road Worlds in Spain and Ferrand-Prévot remains as successful as ever. She took mountain bike gold at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games and holds the record for most mountain bike World Championships titles (five), having chosen to focus on that discipline in 2019. In August 2024 it was announced she would return to top-level road racing for the 2025 season with Visma-Lease a Bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Last winter I was thinking about my future after the Olympics,’ Ferrand-Prévot said before adding that it was time for a new challenge: ‘I can’t wait to get back into the peloton, I am very motivated. I want to win the Tour de France Femmes.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ferrand-prevot-road-worlds-2014\">Pro race history: Pauline Ferrand-Prévot wins the Road Worlds in 2014</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"318cded69c55ee95bb610bd82b940e837199460efcc15077294d31e0322db8ef","category":"Cycling"}
