Apparently the team have even nicknamed Beta Fuel 'grenade gels'.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9884/science-in-sport-beta-fuel-endurance-range-images#3\"><p><span>Image 4 of</span> 21</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/cc-sis-011.jpg?itok=jKakEh1D\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 4 of </span>21</p>\n</div><p></p>\n<h3>Beta Fuel, alpha performance</h3>\n<p>The development made by the brand's scientists that Beta Fuel has at its heart is the use of a new maltodextrin to fructose ratio, changing from the traditional 2:1 to 1:0.8.</p>\n<p>This adaptation means that a higher percentage of the carbohydrates ingested can actually be used by the body, as the new ratio increases the percentage of ingested carbohydrate that is oxidised from 62% to 74%.</p>\n<p>That then means that the body can use up to 90g of carbohydrates per hour, unlocking an extra level from both the product and the rider.</p>\n<p>On top of that, SiS claims that not a single participant in its testing of the Beta Fuel products reported symptoms of gastrointestinal distress, possibly aided by the lack of artificial sweeteners.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9884/science-in-sport-beta-fuel-endurance-range-images#4\"><p><span>Image 5 of</span> 21</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/cc-sis-012.jpg?itok=NEvCnhtX\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 5 of </span>21</p>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>SiS director of performance solutions, Professor James Morton – who previously worked for Team Sky and Liverpool FC – explains the development, saying, 'One of the greatest challenges in any sport is to quickly, conveniently, and adequately fuel in the throes of competition.</p>\n<p>'Our science but practical based solution – underpinned by an optimal ratio of maltodextrin and fructose – is the key to Beta Fuel.</p>\n<p>'We have spent years researching and finessing the optimum carbohydrate delivery system to allow athletes to fuel their best performances. We are confident that our latest product range is the most sophisticated and complete on the market and is set to redefine the way athletes approach endurance sports.'</p>\n<h3>Home on the range</h3>\n<p>There are three types of Beta Fuel products: energy drink powder, gels and chew bars.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scienceinsport.com/shop-sis/go-range/beta-fuel\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Check out the full Beta Fuel range now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>The powder is available in orange, red berry or strawberry and lime flavour, while the chews – which are a new easily digestible texture that can be split into three blocks – come in lemon and orange.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/6834/how-much-did-tadej-pogacar-earn-for-winning-the-tour-de-france-and-how-does-that\">How much did Tadej Pogacar earn for winning the Tour de France and how does that compare to other sports?</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1755/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2021: Everything you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/905/how-does-hot-weather-affect-your-cycling-performance\">How does hot weather affect your cycling performance?</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 116: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nThe standard Beta Fuel gels have strawberry and lime or orange flavour, however there are also Beta Fuel + Nootropics gels in apple or lemon and lime that SiS says also help to maintain peak cognitive function throughout long rides.</p>\n<p>You can also buy a special Beta Fuel 750ml bottle if you fancy it too.</p>\n<p>For more information and to check out the Beta Fuel range, visit <a href=\"https://www.scienceinsport.com/betafuel\" target=\"_blank\">scienceinsport.com</a>. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/news/9884/science-in-sport-beta-fuel-endurance-range-images\">Science in Sport Beta Fuel endurance range images</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/news\">News</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>15 Jul 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9884%2Fscience-in-sport-beta-fuel-endurance-range-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Science%20in%20Sport%20Beta%20Fuel%20endurance%20range%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9884%2Fscience-in-sport-beta-fuel-endurance-range-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Science%20in%20Sport%20Beta%20Fuel%20endurance%20range%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9884%2Fscience-in-sport-beta-fuel-endurance-range-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Science%20in%20Sport%20Beta%20Fuel%20endurance%20range%20images&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9884%2Fscience-in-sport-beta-fuel-endurance-range-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9884/science-in-sport-beta-fuel-endurance-range-images#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 21</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/cc-sis-003.jpg?itok=8bSNvRQp\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/cycling-nutrition\">Cycling nutrition</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"878c4247e3e1f9a008a0b7421af05b3fac26d8af4a4604a6777ec030dfe837cd","category":"Cycling"}
