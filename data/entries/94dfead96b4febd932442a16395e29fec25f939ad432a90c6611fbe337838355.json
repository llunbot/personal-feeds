Both the Disney+ and Hulu websites say that new and returning subscribers cannot sign up for and pay through Apple, but existing Apple-billed subscribers are not affected.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHulu and Disney+ customers can still watch content on Apple devices by signing into their Hulu and Disney+ accounts in the iOS apps. Disney is now directing customers to its websites in order to see all plans and sign up for a subscription directly.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor digital purchases like subscription services, Apple collects a 15 to 30 percent fee from each transaction. By removing the option to sign up for streaming services using the in-app purchase system, Disney will not have to pay a fee to Apple and it will be classified as a \"reader\" app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDisney's decision to stop supporting in-app purchases correlates with price increases that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/06/disney-raising-streaming-prices/\">went into effect</a> on October 17. Disney+ plan pricing went up by $2, while Hulu with ads is $2 more expensive and Hulu without ads is $1 more. Eliminating the in-app purchase fees paid to Apple seems to be part of an effort to boost streaming revenue, paired with price hikes and also a recent <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/07/disney-plus-password-sharing-september/\">crackdown on password sharing</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDisney+ and Hulu will no longer be eligible for <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/programs/video-partner/\">Apple's Video Partner Program</a> going forward, and subscribers may notice a change in tvOS and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> app. The Video Partner Program provides integration with Apple technologies like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a>, Universal Search, zero sign-on, and more for streaming video apps that support in-app purchase.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney/\">Disney</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney-plus/\">Disney Plus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/hulu/\">Hulu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/21/hulu-disney-plus-no-app-store-signup/\">Hulu and Disney+ No Longer Support Signups and Payment Using App Store</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hulu-and-disney-no-longer-support-signups-and-payment-using-app-store.2440638/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"94dfead96b4febd932442a16395e29fec25f939ad432a90c6611fbe337838355","category":"Apple"}
