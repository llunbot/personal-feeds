The new G303 uses a 2.4 GHz wireless dongle that the product page claims can support up to a 32.8-foot distance. According to Best Buy, the mouse is rechargeable via an included USB-C cable.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813291#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813291&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"dc4de769ae5eb29407d090cd0bd2639d9e42dbd11b139b98460ff769cdd103f3","category":"Tech"}
