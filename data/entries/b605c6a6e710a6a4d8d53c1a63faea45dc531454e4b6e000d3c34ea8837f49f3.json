Designed to fill the gap between smartphones and laptops, the original ‌iPad‌ featured a 9.7-inch LED-backlit multitouch display, Apple's first custom designed chip, a 30-pin dock connector, and up to 64GB storage. With a starting price of $499, it offered users a new way to browse the web, read eBooks, watch videos, and interact with Apple's growing app ecosystem. Jobs described it as \"a magical and revolutionary device.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<blockquote>iPad is our most advanced technology in a magical and revolutionary device at an unbelievable price. iPad creates and defines an entirely new category of devices that will connect users with their apps and content in a much more intimate, intuitive and fun way than ever before.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPad‌ used a version of iOS tailored for its larger display, bringing a big-screen experience to familiar mobile apps like Safari, Mail, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a>. It introduced the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ibooks/\">iBooks</a> app and iBookstore as part of an effort to compete in the e-reading space dominated by Amazon's Kindle. Its design was characterized by thick black bezels, a physical home button, and a convex aluminum back. It weighed 1.5 pounds and offered 10 hours of battery life.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe initial reception to the ‌iPad‌ was mixed. While many praised its lightweight computing and media consumption experience, others questioned its necessity and potential to replace laptops.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNevertheless, the ‌iPad‌ sold over 300,000 units on its launch day in April 2010 and one million within its first month. It catalyzed the creation of a new product category, sparking competition from rivals such as Samsung, Microsoft, and Amazon. By the end of 2010, Apple had sold over 15 million iPads, generating $9.5 billion in revenue and solidifying the device as a key pillar of the company's product lineup.\r<br />\n \r<br />\nThe ‌iPad‌ has since become a tentpole device for Apple, expanding into product lines including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> and accessories such as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> and Magic Keyboard. Subsequent models introduced cameras, multitasking, different display size options, USB-C connectivity, and more.
