As you may have already worked out, ditching the cassette and converting to a singlespeed cog leaves you with only one gear at the rear.</p>\n<p>The Zwift Hub does this simply by controlling the resistance you feel at the trainer, similar to how it would during an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/erg-mode/\">ERG mode</a> workout.</p>\n<p>There are no electronics in the Zwift Cog itself. It’s simply a single cog sandwiched in between two plastic bumpers, mounted on an otherwise standard Shimano HG freehub.</p>\n<p>The Zwift Cog (and Zwift Hub One, which is a Zwift Hub with the Cog pre-installed) ships with a wireless virtual shifter called the Zwift Click. This uses a simple two-button layout, with + for a harder gear and – for an easier gear.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Zwift Click photographed on carpet.\" title=\"Zwift Click\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Cog ships with the Zwift Click, enabling you to change gear.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Hub’s virtual drivetrain has 24 discreet gears, with an enormous range equivalent to a 30x40t easiest gear all the way up to 55x10t at the top end.</p>\n<p>As promised, the gaps between the gears are small, there are no duplicate gears (as there typically are on a 2x drivetrain), and shifts are completely silent and can be performed under load.</p>\n<p>You can also shift using the Zwift Play controllers, and have both the Play and Click controllers connected simultaneously, if you choose.</p>\n<p>Overall, the implementation is very impressive.</p>\n<p>It feels a little less ‘realistic’ because you’re not using your bike’s gears in the same way you do in the real world, simply modulating the trainer’s resistance.</p>\n<p>But the effect is subtle and you quickly get used to it.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

the Zwift Cog with the Zwift Play controllers.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The simplicity of the easier/harder shifting logic – as opposed to shifting between two chainrings combined with a rear cassette – also feels more accessible to less experienced cyclists.</p>\n<p>Whenever you mount a bike to the Cog, Zwift automatically calibrates the gear range to your bike’s chainring.</p>\n<p>This means you get the same gear range in Zwift, no matter what gears the bike you’re using has.</p>\n<p>There’s no need to manually enter your chainring size or anything like that – you simply mount the bike and the Hub works it all out as you start your ride.</p>\n<p>In practice, switching between my <a

</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>In terms of noise, the less-profiled, more workmanlike teeth on the Cog are a little louder than the middle cogs on a high-end road cassette.</p>\n<p>However, changing gears with an on-bike drivetrain can cause a surprising amount of noise, especially when doing so under load (as you would when shifting down multiple gears on the cassette at the start of a sprint, for example).</p>\n<p>Eliminating these shifts therefore helps make using the Hub noticeably quieter overall.</p>\n<h2>What downsides are there to the Zwift Cog?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n

downside to the Zwift Cog is the fact that, as things stand, it’s only compatible with the Zwift Hub.</p>\n<p>Physically, it may fit similar trainers, such as the JetBlack Volt or the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/pinnacle-hc-turbo-home-smart-trainer-review/\">Pinnacle HC Turbo Home smart trainer</a>. Given the virtual drivetrain is simulated by the Hub trainer itself, though, the Zwift Cog on its own wouldn’t be much use on those.</p>\n<p>At first glance, this seems a shame because indoor cycling gadgets have, for the most part, been fairly platform-agnostic previously.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/wahoo-kickr-climb-first-ride-review/\">Wahoo’s Kickr Climb</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/elite-sterzo-smart/\">Elite Sterzo Smart</a>, for example, can be used with practically any <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-indoor-cycling-apps/\">indoor cycling app</a>.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, as a manufacturer of both hardware and software, there’s little incentive for Zwift to develop this tech to be used with competitors’ products.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Zwift Cog in pieces photographed on blue foam mat.\" title=\"Zwift Cog\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Cog can be disassembled using a chain whip and cassette lockring tool.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Zwift can hardly be faulted for developing new tech and features to drive engagement with its own platform.</p>\n<p>When Wahoo launched its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/wahoo-rgt-steering/\">Kickr Steer device</a> earlier this year, it was designed exclusively for use with Wahoo RGT, after all.</p>\n<p>And though you’re tied to the Zwift app if you want to use the Cog and the Hub’s virtual drivetrain, the Cog can be disassembled using a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/maintenance/tools-kits-and-boxes/chain-whips/\">chain whip</a> and cassette lockring tool, to allow the use of a standard cassette.</p>\n<p>With a cassette in place, the Zwift Hub functions like any other smart trainer and can be used with any device and platform that supports its Bluetooth or ANT+ protocols.</p>\n<p>This means you’re not locked into the Cog and virtual drivetrain system when purchasing a Zwift Hub One, either.</p>\n<h2>More like this, please</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Zwift Hub One thru-axle mount.\" title=\"Zwift Hub One\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Together, the Zwift Hub and Zwift Cog make it easy to get started.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Just when it appeared that smart trainer tech had reached something of a plateau, the Zwift Cog and the Hub’s virtual drivetrain feel like welcome innovations.</p>\n<p>Virtual drivetrains already existed on many of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/indoor-bikes/\">best smart bikes</a>, for example, but using them as a tool to simplify and widen the compatibility of the Zwift Hub was a clever idea.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, manufacturers of other apps, such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/trainerroad/\">TrainerRoad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/rouvy-everything-you-need-to-know/\">Rouvy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/wahoo-systm-guide/\">Wahoo SYSTM</a>, can implement support for the Hub’s virtual drivetrain into their systems going forward.</p>\n<p>It would also be great to see other smart trainer manufacturers take inspiration from Zwift to make their devices simpler and easier to use, too.</p>\n<p>With so many options available, knowing exactly what you need to get started with a smart trainer and an indoor cycling app could be tricky.</p>\n<p>Even if, as a more experienced rider, you knew what you needed to do, the hassle of needing to swap cassettes and potentially a freehub, to get your bikes to fit a trainer could be frustrating or unappealing.</p>\n<p>The best thing about the Zwift Hub One and Zwift Cog, then, is how easy it makes <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/beginners-guide-to-indoor-training-all-you-need-to-get-started/\">getting started with indoor cycling</a> and enjoying the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/indoor-cycling-benefits/\">benefits of indoor training</a>.
