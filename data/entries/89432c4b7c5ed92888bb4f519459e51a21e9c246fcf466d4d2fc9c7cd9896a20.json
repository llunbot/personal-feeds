At one extreme there is the most high-performance off-road race shoe yet from Quoc. At the other, it’s as chill as you can get near a bike. And in the middle are a couple of simple but modern shoes for any ride in between.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"n Tourer XC mountain bike &amp; gravel race shoes, new AL_TERRAIN sole vs. original GravelGrip tread\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a pretty broad scope to drop into a single release, but Quoc unifies it a bit with a color palette of subdued pink, an earthy amber yellow, and sandy beige.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Quoc Gran Tourer XC mountain bike or gravel race shoes</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_Charcoal-gray.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_Charcoal-gray-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"Quoc Gran Tourer XC mountain bike &amp; gravel race shoes, Charcoal side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_Charcoal-gray-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_Charcoal-gray-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_Charcoal-gray-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_Charcoal-gray-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_Charcoal-gray-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_Charcoal-gray-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_Charcoal-gray-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_Charcoal-gray.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Quoc’s Gran Tourer was their introduction to modern cycling shoes, targeted at adventurous gravel riders. In its original weather-resistant <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-quoc-laces-up-solid-weather-resistant-gran-tourer-gravel-touring-shoes/\" target=\"_blank\">lace-up guise</a>, it became popular for all sorts of off-road riders, and with a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/quoc-gran-tourer-ii-gravel-shoes-review/\" target=\"_blank\">recent upgrade</a> to modern dial retention more performance-focused riders took notice.

A bit of a change from the other Gran Tourers’ GravelGrip lugged soles. Improvement in retention comes from two of Quoc’s own dials for more fine adjustment across the forefoot, separated from the main midfoot closure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upper is still made from tough “abrasion-resistant microfibre” with perforations throughout for ventilation, and gets the signature rubberized wrap-around scuff and weather protection of the Gran Tourer family, plus an extra TPU toe bumper. Inside the GT XCs add three different height arch supports to the insoles to further fine-tune your fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_colors.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_colors-800x400.jpg\" alt=\"Quoc Gran Tourer XC mountain bike &amp; gravel race shoes, colors\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_colors-800x400.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_colors-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_colors-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_colors-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_colors-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_colors.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gran Tourer XC shoes sell for $310 / £240 / 275€, and are available now in Dusty Pink (sand+pink), Charcoal (grey+black), or all Black.

But outside of summer XC race season, gravel feels like a great fit for these shoes.

Plus, it doesn’t hurt that our small size 38 shoes are a lot lighter than claimed at 564g for the pair (282g per shoe). With better weather on the horizon, we’ll be putting a lot more kilometers in on these shoes off-road, but I think the all-road versatility will see them rack up even bigger mixed-surface distances, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Quoc Escape Off-Road gravel &amp; MTB shoes</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Off-Road-gravel-MTB-mountain-bike-shoes_Sand.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Off-Road-gravel-MTB-mountain-bike-shoes_Sand-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"Quoc Escape Off-Road gravel &amp; mountain bike shoes, angled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Off-Road-gravel-MTB-mountain-bike-shoes_Sand-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Off-Road-gravel-MTB-mountain-bike-shoes_Sand-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Off-Road-gravel-MTB-mountain-bike-shoes_Sand-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Off-Road-gravel-MTB-mountain-bike-shoes_Sand-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Off-Road-gravel-MTB-mountain-bike-shoes_Sand-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Off-Road-gravel-MTB-mountain-bike-shoes_Sand-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Off-Road-gravel-MTB-mountain-bike-shoes_Sand-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Off-Road-gravel-MTB-mountain-bike-shoes_Sand.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the GT XCs take off-road stiffness &amp; fit to a new race-ready height and higher pricepoint, the all-new Escape pairing simplifies the Gran Tourer family to the core essentials in order to create more affordable, yet still modern performance shoes. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Off-Road-gravel-MTB-mountain-bike-shoes_Amber-side.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Off-Road-gravel-MTB-mountain-bike-shoes_Amber-side-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"Quoc Escape Off-Road gravel &amp; mountain bike shoes, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Off-Road-gravel-MTB-mountain-bike-shoes_Amber-side-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Off-Road-gravel-MTB-mountain-bike-shoes_Amber-side-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Off-Road-gravel-MTB-mountain-bike-shoes_Amber-side-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Off-Road-gravel-MTB-mountain-bike-shoes_Amber-side-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Off-Road-gravel-MTB-mountain-bike-shoes_Amber-side-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Off-Road-gravel-MTB-mountain-bike-shoes_Amber-side-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Off-Road-gravel-MTB-mountain-bike-shoes_Amber-side-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Off-Road-gravel-MTB-mountain-bike-shoes_Amber-side.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Escape Off-Road is of course the walkable MTB SPD clipless version targeted at mountain bikers and gravel riders, but still with plenty of efficient pedaling stiffness.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Quoc Escape Road shoes</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Road-bike-shoes_Amber-side.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Road-bike-shoes_Amber-side-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"Quoc Escape Road bike shoes, side Amber\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Road-bike-shoes_Amber-side-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Road-bike-shoes_Amber-side-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Road-bike-shoes_Amber-side-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Road-bike-shoes_Amber-side-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Road-bike-shoes_Amber-side-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Road-bike-shoes_Amber-side-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Road-bike-shoes_Amber-side-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Escape-Road-bike-shoes_Amber-side.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Escape Road is pretty much a carbon-copy of the Off-Road version, which is a good thing for endurance roadies.

Developed for either hard-charging cyclists who need to let their feet relax after a long ride, or just as a lightweight slip-on for adventure bikepacking riders to pop on for post-ride camp life, the Lalas get their name directly from the Lalashan mountains.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lala tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_sole.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_sole-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"Quoc Lala Slide post-ride slip-on sandals, studio sole\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_sole-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_sole-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_sole-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_sole-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_sole-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_sole-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_sole-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_sole.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lala slides are pretty simple, but still pack in some good tech – and an outdoor-ready grippy outsole. Quoc designed the anatomic cushioned foam footbed to offer support and a secure fit, with space for air to move around and under your toes, whether still in socks or barefoot. Then, they bonded on soft, thick microfiber straps – the same durable Gran Tourer fabric – for durable but comfy hold around your foot.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_color-options.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_color-options-800x400.jpg\" alt=\"Quoc Lala Slide post-ride slip-on sandals, colors\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_color-options-800x400.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_color-options-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_color-options-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_color-options-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_color-options-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_color-options.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lala slides come in four colors that actually create very different looks – from the all black that kind of disappear, the Sand tan straps with a black footbed for a bit of almost monochrome contrast, or the gray footbed with either Amber or Dusty Pink straps to stand out a bit more. The slip-on sandals sell for $50 / £39 / 45€ now in the same size range, with a weight of just 150g per shoe (size 43).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lala First Impressions</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_lounging.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_lounging-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"Quoc Lala Slide post-ride slip-on sandals\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_lounging-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_lounging-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_lounging-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_lounging-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_lounging-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_lounging-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_lounging.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Just because the snowy, cold &amp; wet weather kept us out of the XC shoes didn’t mean we stopped riding. So tired feet needed lots of recovery time. To be honest, we wondered if we really needed a pair of cycling-specific slippers, but oh how we’ve changed our tune. The Quoc Lala slides are simple and kinda perfect. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, our little size 38 ones are quite a bit lighter than the average at 246g (123g per shoe).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_246g-actual-weight.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_246g-actual-weight-800x500.jpg\" alt=\"Quoc Lala Slide post-ride slip-on sandals, actual weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_246g-actual-weight-800x500.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_246g-actual-weight-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_246g-actual-weight-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_246g-actual-weight-768x480.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_246g-actual-weight-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Lala-slides_slip-on-post-ride-sandals_246g-actual-weight.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Around the house after a ride they were super comfortable to slip on, and quickly became a daily favorite – whether there were bikes to ride or not. Justifying the price for a pair of slip-ons will always be a tough call, and a personal one. But these slides look great, feel great, and have probably been worn for more hours in the past month than any other single pair of shoes in the house. That’s our hot take.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_sunset-ride.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_sunset-ride-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"Quoc Gran Tourer XC mountain bike &amp; gravel race shoes, sunset ride\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_sunset-ride-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_sunset-ride-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_sunset-ride-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_sunset-ride-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_sunset-ride-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_sunset-ride-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Quoc-Gran-Tourer-XC-mountain-bike-gravel-race-shoes_sunset-ride.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All four new Lalashan Collection shoes are available now direct from Quoc, and from their retailer network.<br /><em><a href=\"https://quoc.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">Quoc.cc</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/quoc-gran-tourer-xc-shoes-lalashan-lala-slides/\">Quoc Gran Tourer Shoes go XC, Escape Road &amp; Off-Road at Lower Price, plus Lala Slides</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"89432c4b7c5ed92888bb4f519459e51a21e9c246fcf466d4d2fc9c7cd9896a20","category":"Cycling"}
