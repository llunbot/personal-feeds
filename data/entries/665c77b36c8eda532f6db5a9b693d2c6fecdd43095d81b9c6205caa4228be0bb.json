Wainwright partnered with Disney+ for her latest series, the resolutely PG-13 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renegade_Nell\"><em>Renegade Nell</em></a>, which is a different beast altogether: a good old-fashioned, swashbuckling comic adventure with a supernatural twist, featuring a sassy cross-dressing heroine forced to turn to highway robbery to survive.</p>\n<p><strong>(Some spoilers below, but no major reveals.)</strong></p>\n<p>Set in 1705 during the reign of Queen Anne (Jodhi May, <em>Gentleman Jack</em>), the series stars Louisa Harland (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry_Girls\"><em>Derry Girls</em></a>) as Nell Jackson. Nell is a headstrong young woman with tomboy flair and a taste for adventure who returns home to her village of Tottenham after running off five years before to marry one Captain Jackson against her father's wishes. She's now widowed and possessed of occasional supernatural skills whenever someone threatens her, courtesy of a fairy sprite named <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Blind\">Billy Blind</a> (Nick Mohammed, aka Nathan from <em>Ted Lasso</em>), who has been tasked to protect Nell. Nell's family thought she'd been killed on the battlefield alongside her husband, so her homecoming is a bit of a shock.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017126#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017126&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"665c77b36c8eda532f6db5a9b693d2c6fecdd43095d81b9c6205caa4228be0bb","category":"Tech"}
