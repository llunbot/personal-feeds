In the previous report, Kuo said Apple's chip would support \"the latest Wi-Fi 7 spec,\" but he did not provide any further details, and his latest post does not mention a Wi-Fi version number. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll four iPhone 16 models already support Wi-Fi 7 with Broadcom's chip, but they have some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/m4-mac-models-no-wi-fi-7/\">limited specifications</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nJeff Pu, another analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain, said in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/iphone-se-4-5g-modem-jeff-pu/\">November 2024</a> that only the iPhone 17 Pro models will be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip, but Apple's plans may have changed since then.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith Wi-Fi 7 support, iPhone 17 models could leverage the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously when paired with a compatible router, enhancing data transfer speeds, reducing latency, and improving overall connection stability. Qualcomm states that Wi-Fi 7 can achieve peak speeds exceeding 40 Gbps, making it up to four times faster than Wi-Fi 6E.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's Wi-Fi chip is distinct from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/\">C1 modem</a> chip that Apple debuted in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a> on Wednesday. However, it is believed that Apple wants to combine these into a single component. Ultimately, the goal is to create a wireless setup where the components are tightly integrated and more energy efficient, allowing Apple to cut down on the battery use of cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth technologies.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/\">iPhone 17 Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/kuo-iphone-17-models-apple-designed-wi-fi-7-chip/\">Kuo: All iPhone 17 Models Will Feature Apple-Designed Wi-Fi Chip to 'Enhance Connectivity'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-all-iphone-17-models-will-feature-apple-designed-wi-fi-chip-to-enhance-connectivity.2449793/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"039065882c721d9bd5d46cda9af3d6fa8b81844c085b8ef0c1452adc0cdef3dc","category":"Apple"}
