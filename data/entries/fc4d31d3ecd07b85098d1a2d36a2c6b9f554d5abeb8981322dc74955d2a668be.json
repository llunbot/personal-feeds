{"title":"HashiCorp 2024 year in review","link":"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-2024-year-in-review","date":1734609600000,"content":"<p>2024 was a stand-out year in the evolution of HashiCorp, and before we head into another exciting year I wanted to step back and reflect on just a fraction of the many remarkable things we’ve done this year. All of this, of course, doesn’t happen without our community, customers, partners, and employees. Thank you!</p>\n\n<h2>Making headlines</h2>\n\n<p><strong>IBM + HashiCorp:</strong> Earlier this year, HashiCorp <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-joins-ibm\">signed an agreement</a> to be acquired by IBM and operate as a division inside IBM Software. With IBM, I believe we can bring modern infrastructure and security practices to an even greater number of organizations around the world, and I’m super excited by the improved workflows we can unlock together for hybrid and multi-cloud environments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Infrastructure Cloud:</strong> We introduced an approach for enterprises to manage not only the Day 0 and Day 1 actions of creating infrastructure and launching security workflows, but also to focus on the crucial Day 2 visibility and management concerns for security and infrastructure. We call this <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/introducing-the-infrastructure-cloud\">The Infrastructure Cloud</a>, and it can be implemented through the HashCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) suite of services. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The 2024 State of Cloud Strategy:</strong> Our fourth annual <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/state-of-the-cloud\">State of Cloud Strategy survey</a>, done in partnership with Forrester, focused on questions around cloud maturity and placed respondents into tiers based on 21 key practices in cloud infrastructure and security. Some of the findings: Higher cloud maturity pays major dividends, and high-maturity organizations were twice as likely to have <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/what-is-a-platform-team-and-why-do-we-need-them\">platform teams</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>The tech</h2>\n\n<p>There were too many new features and enhancements across our product portfolio to list here, but these are some of the main changes that users were most excited about.</p>\n\n<h3>Infrastructure Lifecycle Management</h3>\n\n<h4>Terraform</h4>\n\n<p>There were big, transformative changes in Terraform and HCP Terraform (formerly Terraform Cloud) this year that continued to build out a full lifecycle approach to infrastructure. Some new features made large deployment and migration workflows easier, while others removed significant friction and risk in secret-handling workflows. The main highlights were:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Terraform Stacks to enable multi-component and multi-environment deployments (<a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-stacks-explained\">Learn more</a>)</li>\n<li>Module lifecycle management to simplify Day 2 upgrades and deprecations (<a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-packer-nomad-and-waypoint-updates-help-scale-ilm-at-hashiconf-2024\">Learn more</a>)</li>\n<li>Terraform migrate to adopt HCP Terraform (<a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-packer-nomad-and-waypoint-updates-help-scale-ilm-at-hashiconf-2024\">Learn more</a>)</li>\n<li>Test-integrated module publishing (<a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/registry/test\">Learn more</a>)</li>\n<li>Explorer for workspace visibility (<a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-gains-upgrades-for-module-tests-explorer-and-more#explorer-for-workspace-visibility\">Learn more</a>)</li>\n<li>Ephemeral values to keep secrets out of state (<a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-1-10-improves-handling-secrets-in-state-with-ephemeral-values\">Learn more</a>)</li>\n<li>Config-driven state updates for refactoring and importing resources (<a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-1-7-adds-test-mocking-and-config-driven-remove#config-driven-remove\">Learn more</a>)</li>\n<li>Provider-defined functions to make HCL more flexible (<a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-1-8-improves-extensibility-with-provider-defined-functions\">Learn more</a>)</li>\n<li>New pre-written Sentinel policy library co-developed with AWS (<a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/simplify-policy-adoption-in-terraform-with-pre-written-sentinel-policies-for-aws\">Learn more</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Packer</h4>\n\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/predictable-plugin-loading-in-packer-1-11\">Packer 1.11</a> introduced a more predictable plugin loading process, HCP Packer got more visibility and more sophisticated access controls.

It’s not just one industry that benefits, we see use cases across every sector of the economy, from web design tooling like Canva, to telecoms like BT Group, to government agencies  like California’s Department of Health Care Services.</p>\n\n<h3>Canva</h3>\n\n<p>Even with secrets management tools, Canva still had a secret sprawl problem. They needed a strategy to go along with the tools. When they built their new strategy and made HashiCorp Vault their company-standard, things got better. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>They closed a whole category of risk by removing direct engineering access to secrets</li>\n<li>Saw 87.5% reduction in processes around secret provisioning</li>\n<li>And gained a bunch of other benefits around auditing and team satisfaction</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Read our summary and watch their full talk <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/streamlining-secrets-management-at-canva-with-hashicorp-vault\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>California’s Department of Health Care Services</h3>\n\n<p>The California’s Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) is the largest SLED (state, local, and education) organization in the United States and they’re the backbone of California’s healthcare safety net. With the help of HCP Terraform, they were able to modernize its legacy applications and create a sustainable platform.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>They reduced new environment provisioning time from weeks to hours</li>\n<li>Apps reached production 70% faster</li>\n<li>And they build a lasting foundation for infrastructure management</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Read the full story in this <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/case-studies/department-of-healthcare-services\">case study</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>BT Group</h3>\n\n<p>Security tooling and processes can often be seen as a hindrance to application development. At BT Group, they wanted to get past the defensiveness and arrive at a place where security is seen as an enabler. To do that, they’re moving toward a passwordless experience with Vault and Boundary, and they’ve already seen it significantly reduce the risk of credential theft.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>They eliminated around 50,000 unnecessary credentials</li>\n<li>Build strong user engagement with security processes in Vault and Boundary</li>\n<li>And reduced friction associated with accessing systems</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Read our summary and watch their full talk <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/how-vault-and-boundary-helped-bt-improve-security-without-compromising-ux\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>See more user story presentations on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL81sUbsFNc5bdUUiBVCSjnPRivtDcofgd\">HashiConf</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL81sUbsFNc5ZK1pLff1AutRsp78rfEBCj\">HashiDays</a> YouTube playlists.</p>\n\n<h2>2024 by the numbers</h2>\n\n<p>Here are some of the metrics that speak to the banner year we’ve had:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>4,800+ customers</li>\n<li>Included in Fortune’s 2024 <a href=\"https://www.bcg.com/news/02december2024-the-future-50-companies-built-to-adapt-and-thrive-in-turbulent-times\">Future 50</a></li>\n<li>Terraform Registry (as of December ‘24):\n\n<ul>\n<li>4,700+ providers</li>\n<li>18,000+ modules</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/hugs/\">HUGs</a>:\n\n<ul>\n<li>60+ countries</li>\n<li>180+ groups</li>\n<li>54,000+ members</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Total certification exams passed (all time): 73,000+</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Looking forward</h2>\n\n<p>As we move towards a new stage at an even larger scale, we know we’ll be focused on a few things. </p>\n\n<p>One is our continued whole-lifecycle approach to infrastructure and security management. We know our products can bring immediate benefits to the security and infrastructure management processes in an organization, but we also want to ensure that the products will help maintain those benefits for years to come — Day 2 features are key. </p>\n\n<p>Our other focus is cross-product integration and making all HCP services function as a single platform that supports your own internal platform. </p>\n\n<p>We believe that 2024 has put us in position to help transform even more organizations as they learn how to build applications in a constantly evolving technology landscape. We look forward to doing great things with our users, customers, and partners again in 2025 as we continue to build the future of infrastructure and security together.</p>\n","author":"Armon Dadgar","siteTitle":"HashiCorp Blog","siteHash":"219aa6310b3388f2335eba49871f4df9581f2c58eaeb5e498363b54e835b7001","entryHash":"fc4d31d3ecd07b85098d1a2d36a2c6b9f554d5abeb8981322dc74955d2a668be","category":"Tech"}
