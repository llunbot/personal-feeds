When you finally get the time, there's a nearly endless bounty available: ambitious narratives, professional voice acting, character customization, adaptive simulations, deep lore, and more.</p>\n<p>This is great, but please, I beg you: Let me skip ahead. Starting a game I've already played once before, or would otherwise be familiar with, only to hit cutscenes, tutorials, and low-risk levels meant to train youâ€”just stop. I've halted a number of games, games I would otherwise enjoy, because of their outsize preambles. It's not an entirely new problem, but I can't believe it hasn't been worked through yet.</p>\n<p>Most cutscenes offer a way to skip them.

When I have the time to play a game that won't be new to me, I don't want to play the \"Hold B to crouch\" tutorial level or slowly unlock powers or areas. I've got one, maybe one and a half hours between dinner clean-up and a proper bedtime and a few spare hours on the weekends.
