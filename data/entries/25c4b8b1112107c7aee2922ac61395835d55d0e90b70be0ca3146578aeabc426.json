Cérvelo, for example, has been replacing the rear shock of its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/cervelo-zfs-5-xx-sl-axs-review/\">ZFS-5 full-suspension bike</a> with a solid link, effectively turning it into a hardtail.</p>\n<p>The shock has then been slotted back in ahead of the longer Olympic-distance XCO race a couple of days later (with the same bike needing to be used for both events).</p>\n<p>This compromised approach may well pay off when putting the power down, but could throw a spanner in the works when things get technical on the track.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Trek Supercaliber SLR 9.9 XX AXS Gen 2 and Specialized S-Works Epic World Cup full suspension mountain bikes being ridden through woodland\" title=\"Trek Supercaliber SLR 9.9 vs Specialized S-Works Epic World Cup - 13\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Rob and Tom put each bike through an exacting exam – and then swapped.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>So, how do you balance efficiency and power transfer with grip and control? Can you have your cake and eat it? Trek and Specialized seem to think so.</p>\n<p>Their latest XC race machines promise the feel of a hardtail when you’re on the gas, but should still offer the bump absorption and more forgiving, traction-rich ride you’d expect from a full-suspension bike.</p>\n<p>The two brands have approached frame and suspension design slightly differently, although the end goal is similar. Which is best, and should we be bidding the cross-country hardtail a fond farewell?</p>\n<p>To find out, Tom Marvin’s been hammering the Specialized S-Works Epic World Cup on UK singletrack loops, as well as taking on a multi-day marathon event in Menorca.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Rob Weaver has been using the Trek Supercaliber SLR 9.9 XX AXS Gen 2 for mixed local laps with steep, treacherous sections and fast-paced, rough trail-centre rides.</p>\n<p>After comparing notes, chasing each other around the trails and, finally, swapping between the bikes, they’ve reached their verdicts.</p>\n<h2>Introducing the bikes</h2>\n<h3>Specialized S-Works Epic World Cup</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Angled pack shot of the Specialized S-Works Epic World Cup full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Trek Supercaliber SLR 9.9 vs Specialized S-Works Epic World Cup - 08\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Specialized S-Works Epic World Cup gets 75mm of rear suspension.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Specialized Epic World Cup is the bike the Big S believes is going to replace the XC hardtail.</p>\n<p>The World Cup sits alongside the longer-travel, more traditional Epic in Specialized’s line-up.</p>\n<p>The brand says its 75mm of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">rear suspension</a> gives you the snap out of the gate of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hardtail-mountain-bikes/\">best hardtails</a>, with at least some of the smoothing characteristics of its full-suspension sibling.</p>\n<p>While 75mm doesn’t sound like much, the bike is designed to be run with minimal sag (zero to 10 per cent), so you should get almost as much usable travel as on a 100mm full-supension bike run with 25 per cent sag.</p>\n<p>The custom RockShox shock gives you control over the negative air spring to alter the suspension characteristics of the bike.</p>\n<p>You can switch to No Gulp for a full-throttle zero-sag, hardtail-feeling race rig, or give yourself the Full Gulp treatment with 10 per cent sag for top grip and a smoother ride. There’s a 5 per cent setting, too.</p>\n<p>A 110mm fork, carbon finishing kit and flyweight hoops complete the picture.</p>\n<h3>Trek Supercaliber SLR 9.9 XX AXS Gen 2</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Trek Supercaliber SLR 9.9 XX AXS Gen 2 full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Trek Supercaliber SLR 9.9 vs Specialized S-Works Epic World Cup - 02\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Trek has increased rear travel on the Supercaliber to 80mm.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Trek Supercaliber only has 5mm more bounce than the Specialized, but you set it up more like a regular mountain bike.</p>\n<p>Like Specialized, Trek has designed the bike to offer the pedalling efficiency of a hardtail, but give you enough cushioning to handle the impacts and compressions you’re likely to encounter when hammering around a modern XC track.</p>\n<p>While the US brand still sells its Procaliber hardtail, it’s been a while since we’ve seen any of Trek’s racers rock up to the start line on one. Instead, it’s the Supercaliber that’s the firm favourite – a bike designed to bridge the gap between the Procaliber and longer-travel <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/trek-top-fuel-8/\">Top Fuel</a>.</p>\n<p>Trek has upped rear-wheel travel on the second-generation Supercaliber frames by 20mm to 80mm.</p>\n<p>It’s controlled by the IsoStrut shock, developed in collaboration with RockShox. This is no ordinary shock: it’s designed to be an integral part of the frame structure in a bid to boost stiffness and pedal efficiency.</p>\n<p>Up-front sits a top-tier 110mm-travel fork, while the parts bolted to this fancy frame are some of the best you can buy.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Specialized S-Works Epic World Cup vs Trek Supercaliber SLR 9.9 XX AXS Gen 2 frame details and geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Trek Supercaliber SLR 9.9 XX AXS Gen 2 full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Trek Supercaliber SLR 9.9 vs Specialized S-Works Epic World Cup - 05\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Trek/RockShox IsoStrut SIDLuxe shock is made specifically for the Supercaliber.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>At the core of each of these bikes is a frame that makes them different from a lot of the competition, thanks largely to how their rear suspension works.</p>\n<p>The S-Works moniker highlights that this is Specialized’s top-end chassis, built using its latest FACT 12m carbon fibre.
