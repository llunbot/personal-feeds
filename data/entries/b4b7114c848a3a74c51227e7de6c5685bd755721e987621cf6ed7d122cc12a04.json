All open-source versions of DOS have been released under the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License\">MIT License</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, MS-DOS 4.00 was slated to include new multitasking features that allow software to run in the background. This release of DOS, also sometimes called \"MT-DOS\" or \"<a href=\"https://winworldpc.com/product/multitasking-ms-dos-/400\">Mutitasking MS-DOS</a>\" to distinguish it from other releases, was only released through a few European PC OEMs and never as a standalone retail product.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020236#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020236&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b4b7114c848a3a74c51227e7de6c5685bd755721e987621cf6ed7d122cc12a04","category":"Tech"}
