After leaving Apple, he worked at Palm, Intel, and Rivian, and now leads digital at luxury electric automaker Lucid.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe reflect on the success of the ‌iPhone‌ since Mike's work to deliver the original model and where it stands today. We also look at Apple's Vision Pro headset and consider whether it will catch on. Mike discusses AirPort, a personal-favorite product that he led, how he feels about its discontinuation, and whether Apple is likely to return to the product line in the future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe talk through the process and importance of integrating Apple ‌CarPlay‌ in Lucid vehicles, as well as the challenges involved in bringing new digital features to EVs. We also discuss Mike's experience of working at Apple as a senior decision-maker in the 1990s and 2000s, how the company changed in the formative period in which he was there, similarities between Lucid and Apple, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nListen to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/\">The MacRumors Show</a> on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/id1602394741\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/41XOHIA6w8IxAKJZvrnx90\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/itunes1602394741\">Overcast</a>, <a href=\"https://pca.st/itunes/1602394741\">Pocket Casts</a>, <a href=\"https://castro.fm/itunes/1602394741\">Castro</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdWRpb2Jvb20uY29tL2NoYW5uZWxzLzUwOTYxNDQucnNz\">Google Podcasts</a>, or your preferred podcasts app. You can also <a href=\"https://audioboom.com/channels/5096144.rss\">copy our RSS feed</a> directly into your podcast player.
