If the results hold up outside of Microsoft's internal testing, it could mark a meaningful step forward for an all-purpose multimodal AI that can operate interactively in both real and digital spaces.</p>\n<p>Microsoft claims that Magma is the first AI model that not only processes multimodal data (like text, images, and video) but can also natively act upon it—whether that’s navigating a user interface or manipulating physical objects. The project is a collaboration between researchers at Microsoft, <a href=\"https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/\">KAIST</a>, the University of Maryland, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the University of Washington.</p>\n<p>We've seen other large language model-based robotics projects like Google's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/embodied-ai-googles-palm-e-allows-robot-control-with-natural-commands/\">PALM-E</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/googles-rt-2-ai-model-brings-us-one-step-closer-to-wall-e/\">RT-2</a> or Microsoft's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/robots-let-chatgpt-touch-the-real-world-thanks-to-microsoft/\">ChatGPT for Robotics</a> that utilize LLMs for an interface. However, unlike many prior multimodal AI systems that require separate models for perception and control, Magma integrates these abilities into a single foundation model.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/microsofts-new-ai-agent-can-control-software-and-robots/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/microsofts-new-ai-agent-can-control-software-and-robots/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"99eeb273c969af4c3556929066b2a293fb372cdbebaf6d9171b29d3b806bf073","category":"Tech"}
