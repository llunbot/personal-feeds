Acceptance of the evidence for climate change tends to be lowest among Republicans, yet many of the states where renewable power has boomed—wind in Wyoming and Iowa, solar in Texas—are governed by Republicans.</p>\n<p>That's partly because, up until about 2020, there was a strong bipartisan consensus in favor of expanding wind and solar power, with support above 75 percent among both parties. Since then, however, support among Republicans has dropped dramatically, approaching 50 percent, according to polling data released this week.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"Renewables enjoyed solid Republican support until recently.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-3.png\" /><p>Renewables enjoyed solid Republican support until recently.
