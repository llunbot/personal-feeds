Add in two regular bottle cages inside the main triangle, and third under the downtube, and a toptube bag mount to make the bike more bikepacking-ready – but no fork cage mounts.</p><p>I didn’t get a chance to use it, but Basso says the new bike will come with a removable lever for the thru-axles that incorporates 4mm, 6mm &amp; T25 tooling. Developed to be able to tighten any bolt you have on the bike, it should mean you won’t need a separate tool for any regular roadside adjustment.</p><h3>What didn’t really change?</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104419/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_eddless-descents.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104419/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_eddless-descents.jpg\" alt=\"Review: Fast new 2022 Basso Palta II carbon gravel bike review made-in-Italy, photo by&nbsp;Francesco Bonato, descending\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104419/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_eddless-descents.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104419/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_eddless-descents-297x167.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104419/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_eddless-descents-800x450.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104419/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_eddless-descents-120x68.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104419/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_eddless-descents-768x432.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104419/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_eddless-descents-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>What remains unchanged is essentially the road-inspired geometry of the original Palta that made it feel so quick. Core head and seattube angles are the same. Palta II frame Stack &amp; Reach figures do get slightly tweaked, but really only to allow for the most commonly used bar setup positions, with fewer spacers under the stem.</p><p>Rider weight balance does shift back a bit to make the bike feel more stable off-road. Basso did this by shortening chainstays by 5mm (even while expanding tire clearance) and offsetting the fork forward at the same time, while the rider stays centered over the bottom bracket with the consistent frame reach.</p><h3>The results?</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104428/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_not-always-a-race.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104428/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_not-always-a-race.jpg\" alt=\"Review: Fast new 2022 Basso Palta II carbon gravel bike review made-in-Italy, photo by&nbsp;Francesco Bonato, chill\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104428/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_not-always-a-race.jpg 1500w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104428/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_not-always-a-race-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104428/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_not-always-a-race-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104428/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_not-always-a-race-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104428/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_not-always-a-race-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></a></p><p>All of that amounts to a more well-rounded gravel bike.

And more capable of bombing down long, steep, and loose gravel descents.</p><p>The new Basso Palta II really is just a more fun gravel bike.</p><p>I already enjoyed riding the original Palta, because I can get behind the idea of riding a super-fast bike on the edge of control – stomping up climbs, sliding through washed-out corners, and spinning out on fast hardpack downhills. But admittedly that bike wasn’t for everybody. It required a certain combination of technical road and off-road bike handling skills, and always-on attention.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104431/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_bikepark-Family-Line-air.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104431/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_bikepark-Family-Line-air.jpg\" alt=\"Review: Fast new 2022 Basso Palta II carbon gravel bike review made-in-Italy, photo by&nbsp;Francesco Bonato, bikepark\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104431/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_bikepark-Family-Line-air.jpg 1500w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104431/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_bikepark-Family-Line-air-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104431/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_bikepark-Family-Line-air-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104431/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_bikepark-Family-Line-air-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104431/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_bikepark-Family-Line-air-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></a></p><p>This new bike basically just makes it easier to ride &amp; enjoy – more stable, more comfortable &amp; more forgiving, but still fast.</p><p>The slight rearward shift in weight balance lends a more confidence-inspiring ride going downhill.

Instead, it is 300g heavier, which could also be accounted for by a heavier integrated cockpit, headset, saddle, seatpost &amp; even fork.</p><p>Anyway, it all comes out pretty close, suggesting the new frameset is effectively the same weight as before. The Palta II isn’t a superlight gravel bike, but it never felt weighed down – especially not in that bikepark.</p><h3>Impressions on the little details</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104440/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_green-color-changing.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104440/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_green-color-changing.jpg\" alt=\"Review: Fast new 2022 Basso Palta II carbon gravel bike review made-in-Italy, color shift\" width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104440/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_green-color-changing.jpg 1500w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104440/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_green-color-changing-297x178.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104440/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_green-color-changing-800x480.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104440/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_green-color-changing-120x72.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104440/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_green-color-changing-768x461.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></a></p><p>Another interesting addition is new paint for the new Palta II.

This style of bag mount is quite common now, but Basso coordinated with Italian bag maker Miss Grape to perfectly place the bolts for their new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/07/14/review-miss-grape-road-adds-lighter-compact-bikepacking-bags-for-faster-rides/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Node Road</a> bag. It sits perfectly, just behind the stem.</p><p>What’s unique, the Basso Palta II recesses the bolt bosses a few millimeters below the surface of the toptube, with a little rubber cover overtop for those riders not running a bento bag (<em>see 2 photos above</em>). The result is that when you tighten down a direct mount bag, it’s a more stable &amp; secure feeling than any other toptube bag I’ve ever used.</p><p>It’s stupidly simple, and I love it.</p><h3>Riding Review: Fast gravel, made more fun</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104451/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_why-so-serious.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104451/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_why-so-serious.jpg\" alt=\"Review: Fast new 2022 Basso Palta II carbon gravel bike review made-in-Italy, photo by&nbsp;Francesco Bonato, wheelie\" width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104451/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_why-so-serious.jpg 1500w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104451/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_why-so-serious-297x178.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104451/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_why-so-serious-800x480.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104451/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_why-so-serious-120x72.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08104451/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_why-so-serious-768x461.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></a></p><p>With almost all of the details solved, Basso’s new carbon Palta II is simply a more refined version of their own fast gravel concept, with more fun packed into it.</p><p>The most obvious bump in capabilities is the room for bigger 45mm tires.
