This AI-assisted data analysis experience helps business users find answers to complex problems by guiding them step-by-step through in-depth data analysis—suggesting analytical approaches, automatically analyzing data, and summarizing findings with suggested actions—using natural language prompts. This new capability eliminates hours of tedious and error-prone manual work traditionally required to perform analyses using spreadsheets or other alternatives. In fact, Amazon Q in QuickSight enables business users to perform complex scenario analysis up to 10x faster than spreadsheets. This capability expands upon existing data Q&amp;A capabilities of Amazon QuickSight so business professionals can start their analysis by simply asking a question.</p> \n<p><span><strong>How it works</strong></span><br /> Business users are often faced with complex questions that have traditionally required specialized training and days or weeks of time analyzing data in spreadsheets or other tools to address. For example, let’s say you’re a franchisee with multiple locations to manage. You might use this new capability in Amazon Q in QuickSight to ask, “<em>How can I help our new Chicago store perform as well as the ﬂagship store in New York?</em>” Using an agentic approach, Amazon Q would then suggest analytical approaches needed to address the underlying business goal, automatically analyze data, and present results complete with visualizations and suggested actions. You can conduct this multistep analysis in an expansive analysis canvas, giving you the ﬂexibility to make changes, explore multiple analysis paths simultaneously, and adapt to situations over time.</p> \n<p>This new analysis experience is part of Amazon QuickSight meaning it can read from QuickSight dashboards which connect to sources such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/athena/\">Amazon Athena</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/\">Amazon Aurora</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/pm/redshift/\">Amazon Redshift</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/\">Amazon OpenSearch Service</a>. Specifically, this new experience is part of Amazon Q in QuickSight, which allows it to seamlessly integrate with other generative business intelligence (BI) capabilities such as data Q&amp;A. You can also upload either a .csv or a single-table, single-sheet .xlsx file to incorporate into your analysis.</p> \n<p>Here’s a visual walkthrough of this new analysis experience in Amazon Q in QuickSight.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/22/image-23-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/22/image-23-2-1024x350.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"350\" /></a></p> \n<p>I’m planning a customer event, and I’ve received an Excel spreadsheet of all who’ve registered to attend the event. I want to learn more about the attendees, so I analyze the spreadsheet and ask a few questions. I start by describing what I want to explore.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/22/image-24.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/22/image-24-1024x481.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"481\" /></a></p> \n<p>I upload the spreadsheet to start my analysis.
