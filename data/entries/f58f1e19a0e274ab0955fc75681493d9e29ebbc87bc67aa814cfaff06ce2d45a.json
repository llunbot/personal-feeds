Original iterations of the road bike date nearly 10 years at this point. First, there was a rim brake model called the RT-1. Then there was a disc brake model dubbed the RT-1d. And now, there’s a new version dubbed the Mosaic RT-1 ITR. </span></p>\n<p><span>Before we get into the bike, let’s break down the naming convention here. The “R” in RT-1 stands for road, and the “T” stands for the titanium it uses as a primary construction material. The “1” indicates the frame uses custom-butted, size-specific titanium tubes. What does “ITR” stand for, then?</span></p>\n<p><span>“Integrated Thick Road.” Put it all together, and you get the new bike, the RT-1 ITR.</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-front-side-detail-bike-e1680008982351.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Mosaic-RT1-ITR-front-side-detail-bike\" width=\"1000\" height=\"955\" /><figcaption><span>The RT1 ITR is ready for the road. (Image: Mosaic)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span>The idea of “Thick Road” comes from the bike’s newfound clearance for 35mm tires as measured, up from the 700c x 30mm tire clearance of the RT-1d. Mosaic is careful to note that the bike won’t necessarily fit </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> 35mm tires and that there is some dependence on the rim combination. Rather, it is 35mm tires as measured.</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-enve-integrate-stem.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Mosaic-RT1-ITR-enve-integrate-stem\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1400\" /><figcaption><span>The Mosaic RT1 ITR uses Enve’s In-Route cable routing system. It isn’t the most user-friendly system, but it looks clean when put together. (Image: Mosaic)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span>Mosaic is clear in noting the frame’s limitations. A 35mm tire, as measured, isn’t necessarily a 35mm tire as labeled. One example they mention is using a Vittoria Corsa N.EXT 34mm tire and a 25mm internal width rim like an Enve SES 3.4 rim won’t work. When inflated, the Corsa N.EXT measures 36.5mm and doesn’t offer enough clearance, particularly with a band-on front derailleur clamp optioned. A gravel bike substitute, this is not.</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-tire-clearance-2.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Mosaic-RT1-ITR-tire-clearance-2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1400\" /><figcaption><span>Tire clearance with a 32mm WTB Expanse tire, here measuring out to closer to 34.5mm. (Image: Mosaic)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span>The larger 35mm tire clearance is available despite the stock sizing largely remaining the same. The chainstays are reshaped for greater tire clearance. Trail figures stay in relatively quick 60mm to 63mm depending on size, with two fork rake options available based on size from the Enve Integrated Road Fork.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Enve Integrated Road Fork is necessary for the “Integrated” component of the new Mosaic RT-1 ITR. This is the latest custom frame builder bike to utilize ENVE’s internal cable routing, following examples from </span><a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2021/07/tech-gallery-2021-enve-builder-roundup-part-one/\"><span>Prova</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2021/07/%e2%80%a8tech-gallery-2021-enve-builder-roundup-part-two/\"><span>No.22</span></a><span>, and the likes of the </span><a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/02/do-you-mog-meet-enves-first-gravel-bike/\"><span>Enve Mog</span></a><span>. </span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-enve-stem-detail.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Mosaic-RT1-ITR-enve-stem-detail\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1250\" /><figcaption><span>A clean look. (Image: Mosaic)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span>For those unfamiliar, Enve’s internal routing system takes cables and hoses, routes them internally through the bar and into a stem based on their own Aero Stem. Below that are custom spacers and an Enve Integrated Headset.</span></p>\n<p><span>Mosaic is well-known for their customization. Want a naked titanium finish with a matte black carbon fork? Can do. Want a truly custom paint scheme, custom etching, or polished logos? They can do that too, through Spectrum Paint and Powderworks. Add custom geometry, and it is very likely that your next RT-1 ITR will be unlike any other bike out there. </span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-tire-clearance.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Mosaic-RT1-ITR-tire-clearance\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1778\" /><figcaption><span>A bit more tire clearance here.

Of course, however, that comes at a cost: a frame, fork, stem, and seatpost start at $8200 before options. </span></p>\n<p><span>Learn more about the RT-1 ITR at </span><a href=\"https://www.mosaiccycles.com/rt1itr\" target=\"_blank\"><span>mosaiccycles.com</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-side-profile-e1680009346149.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Mosaic-RT1-ITR-side-profile\" width=\"1000\" height=\"805\" /><figcaption><span>Mosaic bikes are built in Boulder, Colorado.
