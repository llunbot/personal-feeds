The camera features are seen as some of the biggest selling points for the iPhone 12's successor, which is expected to go on sale in the next several weeks.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA new ProRes video-recording feature will let iPhone users capture clips in a higher-quality format that gives editors more control during post-production.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe format is used by professional video editors in the film industry and isn't normally intended for the mass market in part because of its large file sizes. ProRes will record in either HD and 4K resolutions on the next iPhones.</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">bloomberg.com</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/10/iphone-13-pro-res-video-portait-mode/\">Bloomberg: iPhone 13 to Feature ProRes for Videos, ProMotion Displays, Portrait Mode Video, Smaller Notch, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bloomberg-iphone-13-to-feature-prores-for-videos-promotion-displays-portrait-mode-video-smaller-notch-and-more.2307085/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=WUK-O5Qi9SA:9OiL4xf2cNA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=WUK-O5Qi9SA:9OiL4xf2cNA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/WUK-O5Qi9SA\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3e67718601a78a4c90fa3d035a3703da0331f32c09e0f82e4cbbfdc0d24b793b","category":"Apple"}
