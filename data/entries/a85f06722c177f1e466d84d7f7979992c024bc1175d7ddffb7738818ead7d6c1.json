If you play games, chances are you've played something that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Spector\">Warren Spector</a> was involved in creating—with stints at Origin, Ion Storm, and Disney, he helped design and/or produce a whole giant pile of famous titles, including <em>Wing Commander</em>, various <em>Ultimas</em>, <em>System Shock</em>, and the title we're focusing on today: the original <em>Deus Ex</em>.</p>\n<p>But even for someone with Warren's pedigree, and with an amazing and talented design team backing him up, <em>Deus Ex</em> was a challenge to pull off.
