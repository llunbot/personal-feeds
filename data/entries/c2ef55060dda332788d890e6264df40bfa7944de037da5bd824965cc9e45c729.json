But that doesn't mean that cable companies are ready to give up on your monthly dollars.</p>\n<p>A sign of this is Comcast, the US's second-biggest cable company, debuting a new streaming service today. Comcast already had an offering that let subscribers stream its Xfinity cable live channels and access some titles on demand. NOW TV Latino differs in being a separate, additional streaming service that people can subscribe to independently of Xfinity cable for $10 per month.</p>\n<p>However, unlike streaming services like Netflix or Max, you can only subscribe to NOW TV Latino if Xfinity is sold in your area. NOW TV Latino subscriptions include the ability to stream live TV from Spanish-language channels that Xfinity offers, like Sony Cine and ViendoMovies. And because Comcast owns NBCUniversal, people who subscribe to NOW TV Latino get a free subscription to Peacock with commercials, which usually costs $6 per month.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034726#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034726&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c2ef55060dda332788d890e6264df40bfa7944de037da5bd824965cc9e45c729","category":"Tech"}
