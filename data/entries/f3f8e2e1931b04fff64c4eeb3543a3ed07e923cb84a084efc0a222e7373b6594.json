Similar changes in June coincided with WWDC, when Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/apple-trade-ins-mac-studio-m2-macboook-air/\">began accepting</a> trade-ins of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a>, 13-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, and 13-inch ‌M2‌ MacBook Pro for credit towards new Apple product purchases. Apple simultaneously launched the 15-inch ‌MacBook Air‌, second-generation ‌Mac Studio‌, and Apple silicon <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a>. As such, it seems plausible that a similar, albeit smaller, expansion of the Macs Apple accepts for trade-in this month may correlate with the launch of at least one new machine around mid-October.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn July, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> said October of this year could see the announcement of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/apple-m3-macs-october-event/\">first Macs with the M3 chip</a>. He said that the 13-inch ‌MacBook Air‌, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> are all candidates for potential release this month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe as-yet-unannounced M3 chip is widely expected to be fabricated with TSMC's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/\">3nm</a> process for performance and power efficiency improvements compared to the current 5nm-based ‌M2‌ chip, which debuted in June 2022. It will also likely feature an all new GPU with hardware ray-tracing, first introduced on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a>'s A17 Pro chip last month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn September, Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that it seemed Apple will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/\">not launch new MacBook models</a> with M3 series chips before the end of this year. This may mean that the most likely Mac to be announced is a refreshed 24-inch ‌iMac‌ with the M3 chip. The current model featuring the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip has now been on sale for over two and a half years.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/trade-in-changes-may-indicate-new-mac-this-month/\">Mac Trade-In Changes May Indicate New Model to Launch This Month</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-trade-in-changes-may-indicate-new-model-to-launch-this-month.2406100/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f3f8e2e1931b04fff64c4eeb3543a3ed07e923cb84a084efc0a222e7373b6594","category":"Apple"}
