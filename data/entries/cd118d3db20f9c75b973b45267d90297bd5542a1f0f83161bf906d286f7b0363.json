Created to satisfy Festka co-founder and ex-Conti Pro racer Michael Moureček’s need for speed, it features exceptional stiffness from its headtube, down through the downtube and bottom bracket, then out through the chainstays to the rear axle. On the other hand, the dropped mono-seatstay and 27.2mm seatpost combined with the unique rider-tuned nature of the frame’s robot-woven carbon tubes, means the bike still promises to eat up road buzz for all-day comfort and deliver improved rear wheel traction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the Festka Spectre Gravel does all of that but with bigger tire clearance so you rides are not limited by smooth road surfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Festka-Spectre-carbon-gravel-bike_race-bike-tuned-for-Festka-Founder-Michael-Mourecek-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Festka-Spectre-carbon-gravel-bike_race-bike-tuned-for-Festka-Founder-Michael-Mourecek-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Festka Spectre Gravel handmade Czech carbon gravel race bike, with co-founder Michael Moureček\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Festka-Spectre-carbon-gravel-bike_race-bike-tuned-for-Festka-Founder-Michael-Mourecek-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Festka-Spectre-carbon-gravel-bike_race-bike-tuned-for-Festka-Founder-Michael-Mourecek-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Festka-Spectre-carbon-gravel-bike_race-bike-tuned-for-Festka-Founder-Michael-Mourecek-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Festka-Spectre-carbon-gravel-bike_race-bike-tuned-for-Festka-Founder-Michael-Mourecek-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Festka-Spectre-carbon-gravel-bike_race-bike-tuned-for-Festka-Founder-Michael-Mourecek-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photo/Festka)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael always wants to ride fast. And gravel riding was no exception. So he demanded a single bike that blended that all-road style of versatility with bigger – but not too big – tire clearance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He wanted a gravel bike that felt as fast as his Spectre road bike when he stomped on the pedals. And at the same time, a bike that he could ride with 40mm gravel tires to go fast on dirt and gravel roads… or could swap in something like 32-35mm road tires to stick to hard surfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_chainstay-detail-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_chainstay-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"All-new Festka Spectre Gravel carbon gravel race bike debuted at Bespoked, chaintsay detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_chainstay-detail-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_chainstay-detail-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_chainstay-detail-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_chainstay-detail-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_chainstay-detail-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_chainstay-detail-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, a UDH to accommodate the latest SRAM Red XPLR AXS gravel transmission groupset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is this new Festka Spectre Gravel. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_NDS-chainstay-detail-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_NDS-chainstay-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"All-new Festka Spectre Gravel carbon gravel race bike debuted at Bespoked, chainstays\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_NDS-chainstay-detail-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_NDS-chainstay-detail-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_NDS-chainstay-detail-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_NDS-chainstay-detail-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_NDS-chainstay-detail-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With a max tire clearance of 700c x 40mm tires, it might seem under-biked compared to most new gravel bikes that we talk about these days. But Festka calls this a “race-ready gravel bike engineered for maximum speed and performance”.

There, size-specific Czech-made carbon frame tubes are individually mitered, assembled in a jig, and then each joint is overlaid and laminated by hand in a painstaking process. At Bespoked in Dresden’s airport over the weekend, Lenka – one of Festka’s frame builders – worked throughout the handmade bike show on one Festka frame, showcasing the time-consuming process. Building up the transition material from one tube to the next, adding layers of raw carbon fiber weave, resin, and then tape overwraps to compress &amp; hold them in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_outside-detail-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_outside-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Festka Spectre Gravel handmade Czech carbon gravel race bike, detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_outside-detail-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_outside-detail-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_outside-detail-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_outside-detail-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_outside-detail-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photo/Festka)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>full carbon tube-to-tube construction with CompoTech robot-wound tubes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>handmade in Prague, Czech Republic </li>\n\n\n\n<li>52mm headtube for fully integrated internal cable routing through the headset</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enve All-Road In-Route full carbon 1.5″ tapered steerer fork</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_1x-with-Alugear-chainring-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_1x-with-Alugear-chainring-jpg.webp\" alt=\"All-new Festka Spectre Gravel carbon gravel race bike debuted at Bespoked, Alugear 1x chainring\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_1x-with-Alugear-chainring-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_1x-with-Alugear-chainring-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_1x-with-Alugear-chainring-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_1x-with-Alugear-chainring-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_1x-with-Alugear-chainring-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>1x only, 46T max chainring</li>\n\n\n\n<li>electronic shift only, wired or wireless: i.e. AXS, Di2, EPS/WRL</li>\n\n\n\n<li>UDH for compatibility with all drivetrains</li>\n\n\n\n<li>40mm max tire clearance (specifically, width as measured)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>27.2mm round seatpost with conventional external clamp</li>\n\n\n\n<li>BB86 PressFit bottom bracket</li>\n\n\n\n<li>max 140mm rear rotor</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1035g frame weight (<em>albeit</em> an <em>unpainted size M, </em>as <em>claimed</em>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>available in 7 stock frame sizes (XXS-XXL), also custom geometry possible</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1013\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Festka Spectre Gravel carbon gravel race bike, geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Festka-Spectre-handmade-Czech-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Festka Spectre Gravel – Pricing, options &amp;

Frames are made to order, with about a 3-4 month lead time. The new gravel bike comes in a wide 7 size range, and as is typical with Festka, more custom sizing is typically possible for those that have more unique fit requirements. We’re waiting to hear back an exact number on price, but we suspect it will start around the same 7000€ that it costs for a Spectre road frameset. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This bike shows the standard paint scheme for the Spectre Gravel with the majority of the carbon structure visible through just a glossy clearcoat. But of course, Festka also creates some of the most amazing paint jobs we’ve seen on a bike, so you could always transform one of these new Spectre Gravel race bikes into a piece of art if you have the time and budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.festka.com/en\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Festka.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/festka-spectre-gravel-stiffens-up-race-ready-handmade-carbon-gravel-bike-at-bespoked/\">Festka Spectre Gravel Stiffens Up Race-Ready Handmade Carbon Gravel Bike at Bespoked</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"cd118d3db20f9c75b973b45267d90297bd5542a1f0f83161bf906d286f7b0363","category":"Cycling"}
