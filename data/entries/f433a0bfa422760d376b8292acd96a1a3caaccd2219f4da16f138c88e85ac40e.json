Foxconn has invested more than $500 million in India to ramp up its manufacturing capabilities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/iphone-17-assembly-india/\">believes</a> that 12 to 14 percent of global ‌iPhone‌ shipments are made in India, with that proportion to increase to 20 to 25 percent by 2024. Introductory production on the standard iPhone 17 will start in India in the second half of 2025, according to Kuo, marking the first time that Apple begins development of a new ‌iPhone‌ outside of China.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to allowing Apple to move manufacturing away from China, increasing production in India provides Apple with an opportunity to strengthen its relationship with the Indian government. India is a key market for Apple due to growing demand for Apple products in the country.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/\">India</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/make-iphone-16-batteries-in-india-apple/\">Make iPhone 16 Batteries in India, Apple Tells Component Suppliers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/make-iphone-16-batteries-in-india-apple-tells-component-suppliers.2412953/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f433a0bfa422760d376b8292acd96a1a3caaccd2219f4da16f138c88e85ac40e","category":"Apple"}
