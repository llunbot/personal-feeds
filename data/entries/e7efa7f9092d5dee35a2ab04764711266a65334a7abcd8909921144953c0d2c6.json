Users will have access to Apple Intelligence features after setting up their devices. To disable Apple Intelligence, users will need to navigate to the Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri Settings pane and turn off the Apple Intelligence toggle. This will disable Apple Intelligence features on their device</blockquote>With ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.1, ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.2, iOS 18.1, and iOS 18.2, ‌Apple Intelligence‌ was opt-in rather than opt-out, and users who wanted the feature needed to turn it on in the Settings app. Going forward, it will be enabled by default, and Mac, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> users who do not want to use the feature will need to turn it off.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.3 also brings <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/\">Genmoji</a> to the Mac for the first time, so Mac users will be able to create custom emoji characters after installing the update. All three new software updates add tweaks to the Notification summaries feature to make it more clear when a notification contains AI-generated information.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple provided developers and public beta testers with the release candidate versions of iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.3 today, which means the software updates will see a release in the near future. We are expecting the updates to launch to the public next week.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/macos-sequoia-15-3-apple-intelligence-opt-out/\">macOS Sequoia 15.3 and iOS 18.3 Enable Apple Intelligence Automatically</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-sequoia-15-3-and-ios-18-3-enable-apple-intelligence-automatically.2447837/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e7efa7f9092d5dee35a2ab04764711266a65334a7abcd8909921144953c0d2c6","category":"Apple"}
