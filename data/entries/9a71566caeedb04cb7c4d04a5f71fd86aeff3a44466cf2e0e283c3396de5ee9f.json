Apple is now selling a <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM6F3AM/A/polishing-cloth&amp;subid1=1-1-545436-1-0-0\">Polishing Cloth</a> for your screens that costs as much as a <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHJA3AM/A/20w-usb-c-power-adapter&amp;subid1=1-1-545436-1-0-0\">20W USB-C power adapter</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cloth, which is made of “soft, nonabrasive material,” will clean “any Apple display, including nano-texture glass, safely and effectively.” We assume it’ll clean non-Apple displays as well, but we’ll need to test it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple doesn’t list the specs of the plain white cloth, so we don’t know how large it is. In images, it appears to be a perfect square with a small embossed Apple logo in the bottom right corner. Apple says it is compatible with the iPhone 6 and later, MacBooks and iMacs dating back to 2015, all iPads, Apple Watches, and iPod touches, and the Pro Display XDR. We’ll need to test it on older devices to see if it cleans effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we posted this story yesterday, you could <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM6F3AM/A/polishing-cloth&amp;subid1=1-1-545436-1-0-0\">preorder the Polishing Cloth for $19</a> for delivery between October 26 and 28. Now it won’t arrive until mid-December, cutting it very close for a holiday purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Apple Polishing Cloth</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Apple-polishing-cloth.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$19\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM6F3AM/A/polishing-cloth&amp;subid1=1-1-545436-5-545451-9934\" target=\"_blank\">19 at Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9a71566caeedb04cb7c4d04a5f71fd86aeff3a44466cf2e0e283c3396de5ee9f","category":"Apple"}
