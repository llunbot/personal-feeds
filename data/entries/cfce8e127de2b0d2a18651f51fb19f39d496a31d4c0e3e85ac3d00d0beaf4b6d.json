Apple has yet to share the ad on its U.S. channel.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nIn the ad, a mission control center goes through a series of final checks before launching an iPhone 16 Pro into space like a rocket. During a 30-second countdown, the team ensures that all aspects of the A18 Pro chip are ready to go, such as the Neural Engine, 6-core GPU, and support for recording slow-mo 4K video at 120 fps. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"A18 Pro has a faster Neural Engine, improved CPU and GPU, and a big jump in memory bandwidth,\" the video description says. \"It also drives advanced video and photo features like Camera Control, and delivers great graphics performance for next-level gaming.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen it announced the iPhone 16 Pro models in September, Apple said the A18 Pro chip is up to 15% faster than the A17 Pro chip in the iPhone 15 Pro models. The chip is manufactured with TSMC's second-generation 3nm process.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/\">Apple Ads</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro\">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/apple-ad-sends-iphone-16-pro-to-space/\">Apple Sends iPhone 16 Pro to Space in New Ad Promoting A18 Pro Chip</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-sends-iphone-16-pro-to-space-in-new-ad-promoting-a18-pro-chip.2443451/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cfce8e127de2b0d2a18651f51fb19f39d496a31d4c0e3e85ac3d00d0beaf4b6d","category":"Apple"}
