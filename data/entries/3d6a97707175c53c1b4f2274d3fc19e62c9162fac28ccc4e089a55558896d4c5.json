Current iPhone 15 models have a diagonal camera arrangement and are not able to capture spatial video, a feature that is limited to the iPhone 15 Pro models and the Vision Pro headset.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to the updated camera bump design, recent ‌iPhone 16‌ prototypes have also featured a smaller Action Button, similar to the one used on ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌, along with a pressure-sensitive Capture Button for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/iphone-16-capture-button-touch-pressure/\">shooting horizontal video</a> that sits flush with the frame of the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen <em>MacRumors</em> first revealed the latest prototype <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-iphone-16-slim-camera-bump/\">earlier this month</a>, we cautioned readers that it was sourced from pre-production information, and so may not ultimately reflect the final design that goes into mass production. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iphone-16-molds.jpeg\" width=\"800\" height=\"617\" />\r<br />\nLikewise, the existence of case maker molds at this early stage does not necessarily confirm that Apple has settled on this design for the iPhone 16. The molds could simply be being used as test samples based on early schematics. Case makers also often base their initial case designs for upcoming iPhones on leaks and rumors, so the images may not be true representations. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe latest images were <a href=\"https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1759148932028854647?s=20\">shared by Majin Bu</a> on X (formerly Twitter). Bu has a mixed track record for accurate rumors, but schematics and images Bu has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1754127911202828783\">previously leaked</a> show the same design and align with our own information independently sourced from the supply chain.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe should know more when the devices move closer to the Engineering Validation Testing (EVT) phase of development.
