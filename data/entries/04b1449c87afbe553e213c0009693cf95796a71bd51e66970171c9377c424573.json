Here are some I spotted in just the\npast few days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first one of these is particularly interesting because it highlights a key area where LLMs are frustratingly stupid. Kafasis got a notification summary from Apple Intelligence claiming “Package shipped for $427 order” for a used book he’d purchased. The email from Amazon, from which Apple Intelligence gleaned the information, had the price formatted thus: $4²⁷ — omitting the decimal and putting the cents in superscript. That’s a centuries-old formatting idiom for prices that remains common — <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=walmart+price+sign&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images\">e.g. at Walmart</a> — to this day. But Apple Intelligence just sees dollar-sign, four, two, seven, and thus $427.</p>\n\n<p>That’s just stupid.</p>\n\n<p>But where it really gets frustrating is that everyone has to learn this at some point. If you were at Walmart with a kid, and the kid asked why, say, dog food is so expensive, pointing to a sign that says it cost $9⁹⁷ per bag, you’d explain it, once, and the kid would never forget it. “<em>Oh, that’s just another way of writing nine dollars and ninety-seven cents — they do it that way to emphasize the dollar amount and de-emphasize the cents, which really don’t matter.</em>” This would make intuitive sense to the child as well, because they know dog food probably costs about $10 per bag, not $1,000 per bag.</p>\n\n<p>There is no way to explain something like this to an LLM. You can’t teach it like we do with children. Or at least you can’t do it in a way that persists. And with Apple Intelligence in particular, you can’t teach it at all. There’s no place in the system where you can correct the very simple, easily-explained mistake it made upon seeing <em>$4²⁷</em> in an email. But we’ve evolved to expect that we can teach.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/25/notification-summary-miscues\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"04b1449c87afbe553e213c0009693cf95796a71bd51e66970171c9377c424573","category":"Tech"}
