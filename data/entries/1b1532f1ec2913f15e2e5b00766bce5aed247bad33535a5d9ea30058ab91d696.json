The legendary brand says the new groupset is the first of a new range of products, including clutched 1x options for road, gravel and time-trials, all using the same platform and built in Italy using a revised production process with increased automation to contain costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a wide range of configuration options for the 2x groupset with seven chainring combinations and four cassettes, as well as <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/best-power-meters-cycling\">power meter</a> and non-power meter cranksets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo Super Record 13 is priced at £3,900 without a power meter or £4,950 with a power meter, more in line with the competition than its 12-speed predecessor.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>New Ergopower levers</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"862\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-11-862x970.webp\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record 13\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-11-862x970.webp 862w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-11-267x300.webp 267w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-11-768x864.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-11-1365x1536.webp 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-11-1820x2048.webp 1820w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-11-750x844.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-11-1140x1283.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>For Campagnolo aficionados, perhaps the biggest news is the return of the thumb shifter, which was replaced by a second paddle behind the brake lever in the 12-speed <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/campagnolo-super-record-wireless-groupset-review\">Super Record Wireless</a> groupset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it’s not the thumb shifter as we know it; the lever has been redesigned with a lower profile, and Campagnolo says it’s easier to operate from different positions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also now a ‘Smart Button’ on the inside front of the hood, equivalent to Shimano and SRAM’s third control button and configurable in the upgraded MyCampy app to operate a range of devices via Bluetooth and ANT+. MyCampy also allows the user to configure shift performance, including switching to sequential shifting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo has been able to slim down the shift lever by placing the hydraulic reservoir in the brake calliper rather than in the lever body. It says this also makes bike assembly and handlebar removal for travel easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brake lever pivot has been repositioned – as with the update to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-red-axs-groupset-review-2024\">SRAM Red AXS</a> – to make braking more progressive and powerful. The carbon lever blade has been designed to make it easier to operate from the hoods without fingers getting in the way. It’s reach-adjustable too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-970x332.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-970x332.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-300x103.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-768x263.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-1536x526.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-2048x701.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-750x257.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-1140x390.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Four cassette and seven crankset options</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"691\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-9-970x691.webp\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record 13\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-9-970x691.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-9-300x214.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-9-768x547.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-9-1536x1095.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-9-2048x1460.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-9-120x86.webp 120w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-9-350x250.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-9-750x535.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-9-1140x813.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-9-190x136.webp 190w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo Super Record 13 will be offered with four cassette choices: 10-29t, 10-33t, 11-32t and 11-36t. All are compatible with the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-freehub\">N3W freehub</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although 12-speed Super Record also had four cassette options, these were 10-25t, 10-27t, 10-29t and 11-32t, so the new 13-speed groupset trends to lower ratios and wider gear spreads, taking advantage of the extra sprocket to still provide close higher ratios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the 13-speed <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/campagnolo-ekar-groupset-review\">Ekar gravel groupset</a>, there’s no 9-tooth sprocket offered. Campagnolo says that it has used its experience with Ekar in designing its 13-speed drivetrain though, with a new ramp design to improve shifting and a black chrome finish to the chain and cassette to increase their longevity and reduce noise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cassettes pair with seven chainring combinations: 45/29t, 48/32t, 50/34t, 52/36t, 53/39t, 54/39t and 55/39t, with the last three clearly aimed at the pros. That’s a huge increase over 12-speed Super Record, which just had the 45/29t, 48/32t and 50/34t options, although the more recently launched<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/campagnolo-super-record-s-groupset\"> Super Record S</a> 12-speed groupset extended the available combinations, offering all but the 55/39t option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crank lengths available are 165mm, 170mm, 172.5mm and 175mm, the same as 12-speed Super Record. The crankset Q Factor is 148.5mm and there’s an Ultra Torque spindle made in titanium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can choose an uninstrumented crankset or an <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/campagnolo-hppm-power-meter\">HPPM power meter</a> for all chainring combinations.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n

redesigned both the front and rear derailleurs too, with the front derailleur cage updated to handle the large 29t to 55t chainring spread. The new front derailleur is also 10g lighter thanks in part to a carbon outer cage plate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a new battery design with on/off-bike recharging via a magnetic connector carried forward from the 12-speed groupset. Campagnolo says it offers a 750km range between charges, with recharging taking 1 hour or 45 minutes to 90%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rear mech is claimed to be faster-shifting than any 12-speed system from Shimano or SRAM, with a claimed 2.4s to shift up the entirety of the cassette and 1.9s for a complete downshift. That’s a significant upgrade from the 3.3 seconds and 3.6 seconds stated by Campagnolo for the 12-speed Super Record WRL groupset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo has also increased the jockey wheel size from 13 to 14 teeth, providing lower chain link rotation angles and hence lower friction. The upper jockey wheel runs on ceramic bearings.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rear derailleur has been on a diet and, Campagnolo says, has a 25% smaller frontal profile than its predecessor. It can be mounted with a standard derailleur hanger, but there’s also a Campagnolo UDH hanger as an option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brakes too have had a makeover with a new <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-disc-brake-pads\">sintered pad</a> option as well as the organic pads offered with previous groupsets. A swap to titanium bolts has saved around 6g. The callipers work with 160mm or 140mm floating rotors, designed to avoid heat deformation and with rounded edges for greater safety in a crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo says that the sum of its changes has resulted in a groupset weight of 2,445g, 75g lighter than 12-speed Super Record WRL. The brand claims this is the lightest on the market, undercutting SRAM’s claimed 2,496g for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/sram-red-axs-2024\">Red AXS</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Campagnolo Super Record 13 groupset pricing</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-3-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record 13\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-3-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-3-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-3-768x513.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-3-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-3-2048x1367.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-3-750x501.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-3-1140x761.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-3-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-3-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-3-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo has priced the new Super Record 13 at £3,900 / $4,750 / €4,300 without a power meter.

groupset, which had the extra sprocket from the get-go and was launched over two years before 12-speed Super Record WRL debuted in May 2023, so it’s slightly surprising that Campagnolo didn’t jump straight to 13 speeds for its flagship road bike groupset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo promises a complete line of new Super Record products to be launched this coming September, which it says will include a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-1x-gearing-road-bikes\">1×13-speed road system</a> and a 1x time-trial option with bar-end shifters, both with a clutched rear mech. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For endurance and gravel use, there’s a 2x clutched system in the works, while there’s also a clutched 1x gravel option that will handle cassettes with up to 48 teeth – essentially an electronic Ekar, but expected to be branded Super Record X.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo seems to have plans to introduce lower priced 13-speed groupsets too, as it describes the new groupset as ‘the top configuration of the new development platform for future Campagnolo solutions’ and says that it starts a new strategy in line with the brand’s legacy of innovation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo Super Record and Super Record Wireless S have been the brand’s only electronic groupset options for some time now, but with both Shimano and SRAM trickling their electronic shifting to lower priced groupsets, Campagnolo will need fewer premium electronic groupsets to retain its competitiveness across the road bike groupset landscape and avoid becoming a one product company for road bike groupsets.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+6\"><img width=\"970\"
