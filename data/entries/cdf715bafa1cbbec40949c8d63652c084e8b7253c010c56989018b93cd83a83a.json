href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/\">\"It's glowtime\" event</a> on Monday, September 9. Pre-orders are likely to open on Friday, September 13, with launch following one week later on Friday, September 20.

Based on what we know so far, the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌'s upgrades will likely not be as substantial as those offered by its predecessor. Most ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ users will probably have little reason to upgrade, but some who would appreciate a slightly larger display, better cameras, and a dedicated button for photography and videography features may find it worthwhile.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro vs. iPhone 16 Pro: 30+ Rumored Upgrades Compared</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro-30-rumored-upgrades-compared.2419268/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cdf715bafa1cbbec40949c8d63652c084e8b7253c010c56989018b93cd83a83a","category":"Apple"}
