The second-stage rocket only ascended to about 30 feet (9 meters) and traveled just several feet down range. The entire flight was over in 15 seconds.</p>\n<p>And yet this was a momentous step for Stoke Space, which is less than 4 years old and has only about 90 employees. The test successfully demonstrated the performance of the company's oxygen-hydrogen engine, which is based on a ring of 30 thrusters; the ability to throttle this engine and its thrust vector control system; as well as the vehicle's avionics, software, and ground systems.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968948#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968948&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"841b20de07ede15f3b9d4166e743e445a7295e9b9a1c36e1a623c7b3c86694f7","category":"Tech"}
