It doesn’t do much, though. It uses eye tracking, which means it requires Meta’s Quest Pro, and you can swipe between screens with your fingers, but that’s all it really does. None of the app icons are real or functional. See the video below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>During the demo, after moving through simulated visionOS screens, the user swipes down to bring up a grey control panel. That’s not part of visionOS, it’s a set of controls for Nova UI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Supernova has made the demo available to the public, so if you’re savvy enough to implement it, you can <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://github.com/NovaUI-Unity/AppleXRConcept/releases/tag/VisionOSDemo&amp;xcust=1-1-1983173-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">download the Vision OS Demo from GitHub</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has released a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/developer-tools-to-create-spatial-experiences-for-apple-vision-pro-now-available/&amp;xcust=1-1-1983173-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">visionOS software development kit</a> for anyone interested in creating apps for the Vison Pro. Labs are coming to Cupertino, London, Munich, Shanghai, Singapore, and Tokyo so developers can test apps and get support from Apple engineers. Apple will also be providing developer kits (which include a Vision Pro) in the future. Currently, developers can run visionOS simulations in Xcode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-reality-headset-ar-vr-design-features-specs-price.html\">Apple Vision Pro guide</a> has everything users need to know about Apple’s headset.</p>\n\nVirtual Reality</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"10e116f634708213bfc7497f7a94fdf7e294a9f003df2a10732f6cb898bd9898","category":"Apple"}
