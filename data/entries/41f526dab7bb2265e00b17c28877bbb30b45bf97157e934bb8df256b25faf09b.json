Typically wildfire season in Canada affects mostly western provinces, such as Alberta.</p>\n<p>However, this year nearly half of the 423 active wildfires in Canada are in the eastern part of the country, according to the <a href=\"https://ciffc.net/\">Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre</a>. Many of these fires are located within a few hundred kilometers of the border with the United States, and with a northerly flow in place, the smoke and haze have swirled down into the Eastern United States.</p>\n<p>The effects have been profound. On Tuesday, for a time, <a href=\"https://www.iqair.com/us/world-air-quality-ranking\">IQ Air ranked</a> New York City as having the worst air quality in the world, above cities like Delhi, India, and Dhaka, Bangladesh. As of Wednesday morning, New York <em>only</em> had the second worst air quality in the world. On a normal day, it would not rank among the top thousand cities.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1946005#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1946005&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"41f526dab7bb2265e00b17c28877bbb30b45bf97157e934bb8df256b25faf09b","category":"Tech"}
