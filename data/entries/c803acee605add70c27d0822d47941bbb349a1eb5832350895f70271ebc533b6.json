The source of the issue appears to be with one of \nthree onboard computers, the flight data subsystem (FDS), which is \nresponsible for packaging the science and engineering data before \nit’s sent to Earth by the telemetry modulation unit. </p>\n\n<p>On March 3, the Voyager mission team saw activity from one section \nof the FDS that differed from the rest of the computer’s \nunreadable data stream. The new signal was still not in the format \nused by Voyager 1 when the FDS is working properly, so the team \nwasn’t initially sure what to make of it. But an engineer with the \nagency’s Deep Space Network, which operates the radio antennas \nthat communicate with both Voyagers and other spacecraft traveling \nto the Moon and beyond, was able to decode the new signal and \nfound that it contains a readout of the entire FDS memory. [...] </p>\n\n<p>Because Voyager 1 is more than 15 billion miles (24 billion \nkilometers) from Earth, it takes 22.5 hours for a radio signal to \nreach the spacecraft and another 22.5 hours for the probe’s \nresponse to reach antennas on the ground. So the team received the \nresults of the command on March 3. On March 7, engineers began \nworking to decode the data, and on March 10, they determined that \nit contains a memory readout. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Remind me never to complain about anything I’ve had to debug again.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/18/nasa-voyager-1-debugging\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c803acee605add70c27d0822d47941bbb349a1eb5832350895f70271ebc533b6","category":"Tech"}
