It compares information collected at night like heart rate, sleep, respiratory rate, and oxygen level to your levels over the previous weeks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSmart Stack has new widgets like Translate and Shazam, plus it's smarter because it is able to suggest widgets based on time, date, location, and daily routine. Interactive widgets let you access app features from the Smart Stack, and it also supports Live Activities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTraining Load is a new way of measuring how the intensity and duration of workouts impact the body over time, with Apple providing an effort level for cardio-based workouts to help you know when to rest and when to push harder.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can now customize your Activity Ring requirements for different days of the week, and Apple added support for rest days. Taking a break from activity will no longer ruin a streak because you can pause for a day, a week, a month, or more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther new features include more workout types, Check In for Messages, a revamped <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> watch face, improvements to Double Tap, and more, with additional information <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/\">available in our watchOS 11 roundup</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/\">watchOS 10</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/\">watchOS 11</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/watchos-11-public-beta/\">Apple Releases First watchOS 11 Public Beta With Vitals App and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-first-watchos-11-public-beta-with-vitals-app-and-more.2431428/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6d95e5310af0c46df8cdbe21477486505c2e43eaf9ae4bad73071416022a5e38","category":"Apple"}
