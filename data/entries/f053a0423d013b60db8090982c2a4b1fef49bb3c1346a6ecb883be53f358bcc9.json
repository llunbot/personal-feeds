its Atmoz tyre pressure control system.</p>\n<p>According to a press release from the Dutch brand, the ‚ÄúScope Atmoz will be present in the peloton‚Äù this year at cycling‚Äôs toughest cobbled classic.</p>\n<p>This wireless system (which can be installed on ‚Äúany <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-29er/\">29in</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/700c-wheels/\">700c</a> wheel‚Äù) enables tyre pressure to be adjusted manually while riding, using two remote control buttons mounted to the handlebars.</p>\n<p>The Atmoz is claimed to be capable of inflating or deflating a tyre by 7.3psi /0.5 bar per second, meaning significant shifts in tyre pressure could be made within seconds.</p>\n<p>Scope claims such adjustments can offer gains of ‚Äúup to 30 wattage [sic] of reduced rolling resistance, combined with improved comfort and safety in rough and wet conditions‚Äù, if performed at the correct moments.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Scope‚Äôs Atmoz tyre pressure control system mounts to the wheel

href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/wireless-e3998-tyre-pressure-control-system-to-be-used-at-paris-roubaix/\">a similar story about the ‚Ç¨3,998 system last year</a>, with Team DSM ultimately

target=\"_blank\">Wielerflits</a> reports Team DSM will indeed use the system at this year‚Äôs race, however.</p>\n<p>It also says Team Jumbo-Visma will use the HubTech Kinetic Air Pressure System (KAPS ‚Äì a similar system from a competing brand) during the race too.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Handlebar-mounted buttons enable a rider to wirelessly change the air pressure in their tyres on the fly.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Scope</i></span></div>\n<h2>Why would you change tyre pressure mid-race?</h2>\n<p>As we commented last year, such devices could potentially offer significant performance gains if used strategically.</p>\n<p>Though renowned for its cobbled sectors, the majority of Paris-Roubaix is spent riding on ‚Äònormal‚Äô roads.</p>\n<p>An optimum <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/road-bike-tyre-pressure/\">tyre pressure</a> (which provides the best balance of comfort, grip and rolling resistance) for tarmac or concrete roads is too high to be optimum on the harsh cobbled sectors, though.</p>\n<p>As a result, riders and teams have historically compromised between speed on tarmac and comfort, speed and grip on the cobbles.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The cobbles get all the attention at Paris-Roubaix, but riders and teams have to consider performance on standard roads too.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Scope</i></span></div>\n<p>Being able to manually adjust to the optimum tyre pressure for each surface would theoretically eliminate any such trade-offs.</p>\n<p>Of course, these systems do add weight and bulk to each wheel, but given the predominantly flat parcours of Paris‚ÄìRoubaix, the benefits ought to outweigh the drawbacks if Scope‚Äôs claims are to be believed.</p>\n<p>For example, Scope claims its Atmoz system weighs just 300g. Although it‚Äôs unclear if that covers one or both wheels on a bike, even a 600g weight gain would still have minimal performance impact during a race such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/how-to-watch-paris-roubaix/\">Paris-Roubaix</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Even with hardware mounted to both wheels and the handlebar, the weight gain would likely be inconsequential to performance in a flat race such as Paris-Roubaix.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Scope</i></span></div>\n<h2>Are these systems UCI legal?</h2>\n<p>Yes, they are ‚Äì on 11 April 2022, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) released a statement saying ‚Äúbuilt-in management systems for tyre pressure are authorised in professional road cycling‚Äù.</p>\n<p>According to the UCI, the key factor is that such systems apparently don‚Äôt ‚Äúcontain any moving parts or compressors‚Äù.</p>\n<p>Although such systems presumably must have some moving parts in order to store and transfer air (such as valves that open and close, for example), we can infer the UCI is essentially stipulating these systems must not include motors, or anything that could be used to drive the rotation of the wheels like a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-an-electric-bike/\">hub-based electric bike motor</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> HubTech says its KAPS system is driven by the rotation of the wheel it‚Äôs mounted to.</span></figcaption><span> <i>HubTech</i></span></div>\n<p>Scope, for example, specifically says the Atmoz is operated mechanically, and that ‚Äúno motors or compressors are involved in the system‚Äù.</p>\n<p>HubTech, meanwhile, says its KAPS system functions using a lightweight pump ‚Äúdriven by the rotation of the wheel‚Äù, and therefore doesn‚Äôt fall foul of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tech/2023-uci-rule-changes/\">UCI‚Äôs technical regulations</a> either.</p>\n<p>Indeed, according to Twitter, Team Jumbo-Visma rider Edoardo Affini has already set a precedent by using the HubTech KAPS system in this year‚Äôs edition of Dwars door Vlaanderen.</p>\n<blockquote><p>üëÄ Looks like Affini is testing the KAPS adjustable air pressure system. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DDV23?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DDV23</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DDV?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DDV</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/myK3cltMrF\">pic.twitter.com/myK3cltMrF</a></p>‚Äî Janus (@JVerlaeckt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JVerlaeckt/status/1641013515841413128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 29, 2023</a></blockquote><p>Of course, it remains to be seen if any of the big pre-race favourites, such as Team Jumbo-Visma‚Äôs Wout van Aert, uses one of these devices.</p>\n<p>If he or another rider were to secure a victory or strong result using such a device, though, we can be sure it would arouse significant interest from other teams and competitors.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Team DSM has once again been testing the Scope Atmoz wireless tyre pressure control system on the cobbles of Paris-Roubaix, and it‚Äôs claimed it will actually use it this year.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Scope</i></span></div>","author":"Simon von Bromley","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"f053a0423d013b60db8090982c2a4b1fef49bb3c1346a6ecb883be53f358bcc9","category":"Cycling"}
