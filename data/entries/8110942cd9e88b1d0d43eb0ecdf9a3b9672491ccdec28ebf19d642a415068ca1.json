They’re frequently on sale, and we always say they’re worth paying a little extra for if you can afford it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the latest sale on Amazon’s U.S. store is so good you don’t really have a decision to make. It’s not uncommon to find these earbuds on sale for less than $200, but the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/\">AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) are currently $160</a>, the lowest price we’ve ever seen. They’re actually $10 <em>cheaper</em> than the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ7HYG1\">AirPods 4 with ANC</a> right now and bring a ton of additional features, including the aforementioned hearing aid capabilities. Yes, the unquestionably superior product costs less money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you’re grabbing this deal, you might want to pick up a set of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Comply-Comfortable-Canceling-Charging-Assorted/dp/B088KPNKN2/\">Comply foam ear tips</a> as well. They greatly improve the fit and comfort of AirPods Pro 2 and I never use mine without them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our review of AirPods Pro 2, we praised the audio quality and features, with 2X noise cancellation and Precision Find My. And they’ve only gotten better since then with a steady stream of updates—and we suspect even more are on the way as Apple Intelligence continues to grow. So go grab a pair for this insanely low price and get yourself a pair of earbuds that keep on giving.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy AirPods Pro 2 for $90 off at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"8110942cd9e88b1d0d43eb0ecdf9a3b9672491ccdec28ebf19d642a415068ca1","category":"Apple"}
