In fact, GPT-4 is so good it’s writing this week’s In the Drops. Ha! Not really, it’s me, real James. But then JamesGPT would say that, wouldn’t he/it? We’ll never know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is clear, though, is that one the best and least intimidating news stories this week was the release of some funky-painted Canyon Grizl gravel bikes, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/canyon-grizl-throwback\">the Throwback edition</a>, which makes JamesGPT very happy as I grew up in 1990s mountain-bikes, and how I have long wished fluoro-pink and cyan would make a comeback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other news, resident team mechanic <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-tyre-pressure\">Charlotte’s piece on tyre pressure</a> is a must read, partly because I am a cyclist and therefore anally retentive, partly because tyre pressure is the cheapest (read: free) way to significantly influence how your bike feels. Read it, pump it, ride it*. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My top tip: the best tyre pressure is 10% less than you have in your tyres now, we all ride tyres that are too hard. Trust me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, trust me that there is no finer guide to the Spring Classics and Monuments season that is now in full swing than <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\">Robyn’s mega all-encompassing Classics guide</a>. Read it and weep… with joy! Come on wet Roubaix. As the classic Tennyson poem goes, ‘May heav’nly tears polish babies heads/Excitement still to reign/No blood be shed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then finally, I found it strangely heartening to see that this week saw the launch of <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/carltonreid/2021/03/14/bike-boom-pushes-cannondale-mainstream-with-billboard-campaign-at-iconic-global-sites/?sh=7a8c0aa71f85\" target=\"_blank\">Cannondale’s global billboard campaign</a> (click <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thecornerLDN/status/1632786204293832704\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to see its UK road bike ads). It’s not going to change the world, but I can’t help feeling somewhat happier knowing bikes are getting a big mainstream push. Bikes are our future! You heard it here first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let’s get down into those drops…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>*Probably a slogan from a 1990s MTB brand.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Castelli Tempesta Lite jacket</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/untitled-7-970x728.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/untitled-7-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/untitled-7-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/untitled-7-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/untitled-7-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/untitled-7-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/untitled-7-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/untitled-7-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve got a Gore-Tex Shakedry jacket (those very expensive, very black, ultra-light waterproof jackets-who-said-bin-bags?) then I suggest you only handle it wearing snooker referee gloves in a moisture controlled environment. As has been made public by Gore, it is retiring Shakedry from its range partly ‘due to supply issues’ but mainly due to its environmental pledge to be PFC-free (perfluorochemicals) by 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At any rate, that means Castelli has had to retire it Shakedry Idro 3 jacket and replace it with two others, the PFC-free, non-Gore-Tex Slicker Pro (a cool £450 and looking remarkably like Shakedry material) and this, the Tempesta Lite, which <em>is</em> Gore-Tex – Gore Active fabric to be precise.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Castelli-Tempesta-jacket-whole-970x728.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Castelli-Tempesta-jacket-whole-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Castelli-Tempesta-jacket-whole-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Castelli-Tempesta-jacket-whole-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Castelli-Tempesta-jacket-whole-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Castelli-Tempesta-jacket-whole-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Castelli-Tempesta-jacket-whole-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Castelli-Tempesta-jacket-whole-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In cycling terms, Gore-Tex Active is primarily different to Shakedry in that it is a three-ply laminate, not two-ply, meaning it is slightly more durable as it has an exterior layer sandwiching the waterproof membrane, whereas Shakedry <em>is</em> the exterior layer as well as the membrane. That means Gore-Tex Active makes for marginally heavier garments, such that the Castelli Tempesta Lite is 216g vs the Castelli Idro 3 weight of 168g. But really, who’s counting, the Tempesta is like wearing helium-filled silk, and it is every bit as waterproof as Shakedry, if not potentially slightly less breathable due to the triple layers. But again, it’s so marginal as to be forgettable.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Castelli-Tempesta-jacket-3-970x728.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Castelli-Tempesta-jacket-3-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Castelli-Tempesta-jacket-3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Castelli-Tempesta-jacket-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Castelli-Tempesta-jacket-3-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Castelli-Tempesta-jacket-3-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Castelli-Tempesta-jacket-3-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Castelli-Tempesta-jacket-3-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What is more memorable is that, in environmental terms, Active is made from ePE (expanded polyethylene), which crucially isn’t a PFC and is apparently better for the ice caps and the crop yields. I’m not sure why.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I do know is the Tempesta is incredibly light and waterproof as noted, and it carries on where the Idro left off with a stretchy panel at the back which better accommodates breathing and leaning forward (Gore-Tex Active has pretty much no stretch). It’s also got neat little gaiters in the cuffs – sort of a cuff within the cuff to make a better seal around gloves. The Tempesta is also not black, which is great for visibility, albeit despite how it might look, it’s not truly reflective save for some detailing around the cuffs and hem.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://saddleback.co.uk/products/castelli-tempesta-lite-jacket\" target=\"_blank\">Saddleback (£350)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Vala energy gels</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Vala-energy-gels-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Vala-energy-gels-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Vala-energy-gels-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Vala-energy-gels-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Vala-energy-gels-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Vala-energy-gels-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Vala-energy-gels-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Vala-energy-gels-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Vala-energy-gels-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Vala-energy-gels-620x413.jpg 620w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘If you were 80km in, I’d be quite into that.’ So spake my partner when I asked her to try one of Vala’s all-natural energy gels. And I wholeheartedly agree, because Vala’s gels actually taste really nice. Like real food nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There secret is where the Vala gel get their geliness – not from artificially thickeners but from chia seeds, which swell and emulsify in water. Added to this is date paste, maple syrup, lime, lemon, matcha tea powder and salt, and the result is a sweet but not too sweet energy gel that I’d actually look forward to on a ride (usually I don’t mind gels but I really see them as a means to an end).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Vala hails from South Wales and its gels are made in the UK, and having just moved to the west country I’m keen to ingratiate myself with the locals. It’s pretty easy here though, they’re genuinely some the best gels I’ve tasted. More flavours though please!

But what’s that you cry? <em>Who is Brain Dead? </em>And what is a road bike journo doing in a baggy hoodie? OK, maybe there is some stuff I can tell you to justify my existence beyond long titles and AI algorithms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brain Dead is ‘an LA-based international fashion collective’, and you’ll have heard of LA – it stands for <em>Los Angeles</em> in American. I’m less sure about what international fashion collectives stand for though, albeit Rapha informs me that Brain Dead ‘takes its cues from post punk, underground comics and the spirit of subculture as a whole’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can really relate to that as I take my cues from the post office, underground car parks and the Spirit of the Dance, which is a breath-taking show that delivers the powerful rhythms of Irish Dance. But I jest, because although the Rapha x Brain Dead hoodie is pretty self-explanatory, it needs to be worn to be believed. It’s just really, really nice, sitting a bit like one of those gravity blankets, with a lovely reassuring weight to the material – especially the double-thickness hood. It’s the sort of kit Rapha is known for – like the stuff you’ve worn before, just better. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Rapha-Brain-Dead-hoodie-2-970x728.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Rapha-Brain-Dead-hoodie-2-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Rapha-Brain-Dead-hoodie-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Rapha-Brain-Dead-hoodie-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Rapha-Brain-Dead-hoodie-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Rapha-Brain-Dead-hoodie-2-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Rapha-Brain-Dead-hoodie-2-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Rapha-Brain-Dead-hoodie-2-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The big ‘Trail Maintenance’ graphic on the back tells you something here, showing this is a garment optimistically pitched at mountain-bikers out in the woods digging trails.
