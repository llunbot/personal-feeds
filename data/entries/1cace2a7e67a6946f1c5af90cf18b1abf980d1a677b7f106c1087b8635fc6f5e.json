But that lackluster LCD screen has remained the Steam Deck’s biggest flaw, a headache that users need to tolerate to enjoy a portable PC gaming experience that's otherwise quite low on compromises.</p>\n<p>With the Steam Deck OLED, Valve is ready to eliminate that issue. The new unit, which <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/steam-deck-oled-promises-better-screen-longer-battery-life-and-faster-wi-fi/\">goes on sale later this week</a>, sports a brilliant screen that’s finally on par with the one Nintendo <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/switch-oled-review-nintendos-nicest-most-nonessential-upgrade-yet/\">provided to eager Switch owners over two years ago</a>. Paired with a handful of other small quality-of-life hardware upgrades, the new version of Valve’s handheld should arouse plenty of jealousy in those who are stuck with a now-outdated LCD unit.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983637#p3\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983637&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1cace2a7e67a6946f1c5af90cf18b1abf980d1a677b7f106c1087b8635fc6f5e","category":"Tech"}
