The longest WorldTour race of the year is predictable for around 280km but then what follows is some of the most frenetic racing of the entire season; the Poggio – both climbing its 3.6km at 3.7% and descending its twisting hairpins – is a highlight of the professional calendar. Known as one of the hardest races to win, the first Monument of the year plays out like a crescendo, culminating on the slopes of the Poggio and the final run to the finish on the Via Roma. </span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>The race can be – and has been – won by puncheurs like Mathieu van der Poel, sprinters like Mark Cavendish, and even GC riders, like Vincenzo Nibali, but there is also scope for a surprise winner like Jasper Stuyven. To win, a rider must have the endurance to race for almost 300km, the punch to survive the Poggio near the front, the skill to navigate the descent, the sprint to kick on the Via Roma, and the guile to outsmart their opponents.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>Here are those riders who could be in contention for victory at the 2025 Milan-Sanremo.</span><b></b></p>\n<h3><span>Tadej Pogačar</span></h3>\n<p><span>As ever, Tadej Pogačar, starts as a favourite for a WorldTour race this Saturday when he lines up in Pavia.

Not that his shape has ever been the issue at previous editions of the race, but rather things haven’t quite clicked for the Slovenian. Pogačar is a canny racer, showing in the past that he learns from mistakes; at the 2022 </span><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tour-of-flanders-all-the-essential-info-for-the-flemish-monument?srsltid=AfmBOoqoNiTTpoanMznvoLaKP6Sed18-85H6gLAkPmwsiwBZCWR_OFJH\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Tour of Flanders </span></a><span>he was outsprinted by Mathieu van der Poel, but the following year he didn’t leave it late and stormed to victory after a 17km solo attack. In 2025, he once again starts Milan-Sanremo with all the tools to win the race, namely, a strong climbing punch, daredevil descending and a punishing finishing sprint. But he will have to drop the best sprinters in order to claim his eighth career Monument. </span><b></b></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/ZW-106779_1024x1024.jpg?v=1742480544\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar at Liege-Bastogne-Liege 2024\" /></div>\n<p><em>Photo by Zac Williams/SWpix.com</em></p>\n<h3>\n<span></span><span>Mathieu van der Poel</span>\n</h3>\n<p><span>The 2023 winner, Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck), will be one of the men Pogačar will not want to arrive in the final kilometre with as the Dutchman has proven himself to be the best Classics rider of this generation, thanks in part to his devastating kick. The two protagonists have locked horns at Milan-Sanremo in the past and will do so again this weekend. For Van der Poel to win the race, he needs the reversal of Pogačar’s tactics - he will need to hold onto Pogačarup the Poggio to give himself an opportunity for a sprint on the Via Roma. Simply, if van der Poel and the rest of the contenders cannot hold onto Pogačar’s wheel on the Poggio, they will see their chances of victory disappear up the road. </span><b></b></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/SW1_8018_1024x1024.jpg?v=1742480686\" alt=\"Mathieu van der Poel at the road World Championships 2024\" /></div>\n<p><span> <em>Photo by Simon Wilkinson/SWpix.com</em></span></p>\n<h3><span>Filippo Ganna</span></h3>\n<p><span>Ineos Grenadiers’ Italian powerhouse, Filippo Ganna is fresh off a remarkable second-place overall at </span><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tirreno-adriatico?srsltid=AfmBOorNWHjXoRIR9tg6ycndOkp4Fps0pIiNVO7r-_QhkNZRcgMfCGIM\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Tirreno-Adriatico</span></a><span> where he demonstrated his current climbing ability, which is possibly at a career-best. Ganna has finished on the podium at Milan-Sanremo before, when he came second in 2023. He did this by attacking on the flat when the group was hesitating about chasing after a flying Van der Poel who was up the road. Ganna, who will not be the strongest climber or sprinter, will have to race smartly and perform a similar move this year to win. He can also take advantage of the support provided by a strong Ineos Grenadiers team, who will be confident coming off the back of some impressive performances at </span><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/paris-nice?srsltid=AfmBOorAxbEZzBy3W7ZklyiAOrAnNEQbo88GeBOxlccFAUrJ-WZsXLCI\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Paris-Nice</span></a><span> and Tirreno, where </span><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/on-the-attack-ineos-grenadiers-aggressive-racing-pays-early-dividends\" target=\"_blank\"><span>aggressive tactics yielded results</span></a><span>.</span><b></b></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/3_40eb0ad4-c909-45c8-bc76-975b67a3cc97_1024x1024.png?v=1742472950\" alt=\"Filippo Ganna\" /></div>\n<p><em>Photo by Tim de Waele/Getty Images</em></p>\n<h3><span>Jasper Philipsen</span></h3>\n<p><span>Defending champion, Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) is back to regain his title, not only as </span><span>La Classicissima</span><span> champion but also as the top sprinter in the world, which, in the eyes of many spectators is a title currently held by Tim Merlier (Soudal–Quick-Step) and Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek).

After already claiming six sprint wins so far in 2025, most recently at Tirreno-Adriatrico, Milan will be eyeing up a home victory and claiming the first Monument of his career. To do so, he will need to hold firm on the Poggio and hope the group comes back together so he can unleash his devastating sprint. </span><b></b></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/ZW_Photography-100809_1024x1024.jpg?v=1742481018\" alt=\"Jonathan Milan at the Giro d'Italia 2024\" /></div>\n<p><span></span><span><em>Photo by Zac Williams/SWpix.com</em></span><br /></p>\n<h3><span>Mads Pedersen</span></h3>\n<p><span>Milan’s Lidl-Trek teammate, Mads Pedersen, was on stellar form at Paris-Nice last week, taking a stage win and being his usual attacking self in others. Often overshadowed by the likes of Van der Poel and Wout van Aert, Pedersen has amassed an impressive palmarès, including a Road World Championships, Tour stages and Classics like Gent-Wevelgem and Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne.
