And according to a new report, some of the most-used older apps are getting updates too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-06/apple-wwdc-2025-preview-ios-26-macos-26-new-ai-features-ipados-26-redesigns\">Mark Gurman’s annual pre-keynote roundup</a>, he writes about a few apps getting a refresh as part of iOS 26. Among the changes are:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Safari:</strong> Apple’s browser will get “a significantly updated look,” to match the rest of iOS 26. Gurman says the UI redesign will be “highlighted by a more transparent and glassy address bar.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Camera:</strong> The popular app will get a redesign focused on simplicity, according to Gurman. He says Apple found the iOS 18 interface “a bit clunky” and will rethink the approach for iOS 26.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Messages: </strong>As previously rumored, the Messages app will gain support for polls within conversations. Additionally, you’ll be able to set unique backgrounds for each chat that “will sync between devices, including those of other users, meaning that you and the people you are chatting with have the same look.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phone:</strong> A new look is on the way with “a new view that combines favorite contacts, recent calls and voicemails into a single, scrollable window.” Gurman says the look will be optional via a toggle in settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Gurman has previously reported that Apple will bring the Preview app to the iPhone, as well as tweaks to Calendar and CarPlay. You can learn all about the new features during the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC keynote</a> beginning at 10am PT on Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will also be a few new Apple Intelligence features, Gurman reports, including the ability to “create a Genmoji by combining a pair of existing standard emoji” called Mixmoji.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"20a6eaa3bf07c31379af45cb861f8398e0b74fbc22e31b3a7ae757d7d6990126","category":"Apple"}
