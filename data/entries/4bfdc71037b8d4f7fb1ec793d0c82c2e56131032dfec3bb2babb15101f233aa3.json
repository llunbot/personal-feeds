In the U.S., that changed in 2022 with the introduction of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1073091/iphone-14-review.html\">iPhone 14</a>–the first iPhone to offer only eSIM and nothing else. That is a U.S.-only situation: outside the U.S. the iPhone supports eSIM but still ships with a slot for a standard SIM. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this is all well and good while at home, if you are limited to eSIM only you can’t simply whip out your normal SIM and put in a locally bought pay-as-you-go one when traveling abroad. So, can you use an eSIM when on an international vacation? </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is an eSIM?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the name suggests, an eSIM is an internal electronic SIM card that acts in the same way as the old plastic SIMs. The eSIM is linked to your device and does all the same stuff, with some added benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why use an eSIM?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For a start, iPhones can hold up to eight different eSIMs and dual-active eSIMs (thanks to the fact that they don’t have a physical presence that requires space on the device), so you can use different providers for different things—potentially a work eSIM, personal one, and of course one for travel. If you have an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/544579/iphone-13-review.html\">iPhone 13</a> or later, then two of these can be active at the same time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also the fact that if your iPhone is stolen, the thieves won’t be able to ditch the eSIM and swap it out for their own card, which should make recovering it a little easier. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more details, read our guide on <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1064701/how-to-iphone-esim-activate-set-up-cellular-service.html\">how to activate and set up your iPhone eSIM</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can I use an eSIM abroad?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as with normal SIM cards, you can use eSIMs when overseas. However, in the same vein, it will depend on the terms of your current plan or require purchasing a different eSIM from a local provider when you visit the country in question. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you are traveling from the U.S. to the U.K., you’ll want to talk to your current provider to see if it offers international roaming as part of your plan. If not, you may be able to purchase the feature for the duration of your trip. For example, Verizon and AT&amp;T charge around $10 a day for international roaming with an eSIM, while T-Mobile customers with a 5G-enabled device get <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans/international-roaming-plans\">5GB of data each month</a> when roaming. To turn on roaming, go to Settings &gt; <em>Cellular</em> &gt; <em>Cellular Data Options</em> and flip the <em>Data Roaming</em> toggle on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can obviously add up quite quickly if you’re on a long trip, so an alternative is to buy an eSIM from an international provider or one in the country you’re visiting. These are usually data-only, but compatible iPhones can allow two eSIMs to work alongside each other, so you can use the roaming eSIM to handle data and the other for your existing phone number. To save money again, you’ll probably want to reject any phone calls and instead use the data calling features of things like WhatsApp or FaceTime if you want to call home.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a guide on <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1441708/how-to-use-two-iphone-esims.html\">how to use two eSIMs in an iPhone to balance data usage</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Using an eSIM from a local provider while traveling</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to use an eSIM from another company while you travel, you’ll first need to ascertain whether your iPhone is locked to your current network provider. To do this go to Settings &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>About</em> and scroll down to the <em>Network Provider Lock</em> section. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Settings for Network Provider Locks\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1800w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Settings for Network Provider Locks\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1800w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Martyn Casserly</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Settings for Network Provider Locks\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1800w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Can-you-use-an-eSIM-on-vacation-SETTINGS.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Martyn Casserly</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Martyn Casserly</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If it says <em>No SIM restrictions</em> then you’re good to go. Otherwise, you’ll need to buy a roaming plan from your existing provider as the iPhone won’t work on any other networks, just as with a normal SIM. If you’ve reached the end of your contract, then you can request the provider unlock your iPhone, which will then enable you to use an eSIM from a different company. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll want to check in advance which providers are available in the country or countries you’ll be visiting. Apple has a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT209096\" target=\"_blank\">comprehensive list</a> of those available on its website, so you can look up your destination to see the different options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can either set up the eSIM before you leave or do it once you’re in-country. Each provider will give you instructions on how to do this, so follow those carefully and you should be able to happily use your new eSIM while vacationing abroad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you should forget to do any of this before you leave, there’s always the option to pop into a physical store of the provider when you get to your destination. They should be able to get you up and running in no time. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Using an eSIM from an international provider</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another option is to use an eSIM from a global independent company, which gives you the scope to move through different countries and be able to quickly transfer to a new network without the hassle of having to find a local provider each time. One option is <a href=\"https://saily.com\" target=\"_blank\">Saily</a>, which comes from the creators of the <a href=\"https://nordvpn.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NordVPN</a> service (read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668082/nordvpn-for-mac-review.html\">review of Nord</a>, which is number one in our recommendations of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/231047/best-vpn-for-mac.html\">best VPN</a>). With Saily you can buy set amounts of data for different countries or entire regions, which last for a specific number of days. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saily.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Saily eSIMs\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saily.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1466w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saily.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saily.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saily.jpg?resize=1200%2C674&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saily.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saily.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"674\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Saily eSIMs\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saily.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1466w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saily.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saily.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saily.jpg?resize=1200%2C674&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saily.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saily.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"674\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Saily</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Saily eSIMs\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saily.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1466w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saily.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saily.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saily.jpg?resize=1200%2C674&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saily.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saily.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"674\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Saily</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Saily</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if you were traveling to France for a week, then you could pick up an eSIM with 1GB of data for 7 days and only pay $3.99. If you need more, then there’s a 3GB plan that lasts for 30 days and costs $8.99. But, should you be going on a grand tour, then Saily also offers a European eSIM that works in 35 countries across the continent. The 1GB / 7 day plan costs $4.99, while the 3GB / 30 day variant is $12.49. There are also higher data plans available on the <a href=\"https://saily.com\" target=\"_blank\">Saily website.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re lucky enough to be travelling around the world, then there’s also a Global plan available which covers 105 countries. For this you’ll pay $8.99 for the 1GB / 7 day plan and $23.39 if you want the 3GB / 30 day one instead. Again there are plenty of other tiers available if you need more data while on your adventure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything is handled through the <a href=\"https://saily.onelink.me/ymzx/appstore/\">Saily app</a> and signing up to an eSIM is fast and simple, with 24/7 chat there to help with any issues or questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, there you have it, a quick guide on how to make your travels easier by using eSIMs to handle your data.
