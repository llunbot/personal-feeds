Intel partially addressed the issue by <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/intel-reportedly-blames-motherboard-makers-for-core-i9-cpu-crashes/\">insisting</a> that third-party motherboard makers adhere to Intel's recommended default power settings in their motherboards, but the company said it was still working to identify the root cause of the problem.</p>\n\n<p>The company announced yesterday that it has wrapped up its investigation and that a microcode update to fix the problem should be shipping out to motherboard makers in mid-August \"following full validation.\" Microcode updates like this generally require a BIOS update, so exactly when the patch hits your specific motherboard will be up to the company that made it.</p>\n<p>Intel says that an analysis of defective processors \"confirms that the elevated operating voltage is stemming from a microcode algorithm resulting in incorrect voltage requests to the processor.\" In other words, the CPU is receiving too much power, which is degrading stability over time.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038549#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038549&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"05051d77b397670a3c2763b825c8a9a01ecb9249eb0b4939f1b2ae9c1d1ec8bc","category":"Tech"}
