{"title":"Will There Be An Apple Event in October?","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/apple-october-event-possibility/","date":1695944040000,"content":"It is typical for Apple to hold up to four events per year: one in the spring, WWDC in June, the fall <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> event, and a fourth fall event that's Mac and/or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> focused. Unfortunately, there are few additional product announcements planned for the final months of 2023, and it's looking like there won't be another fall event this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/ipad-air-pink.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nEarlier this month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> told <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/\">The MacRumors Show</a> hosts that he <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/09/gurman-october-apple-event-unlikely/\">does not expect</a> Apple to hold an October event because the company does not have enough new products and features to justify it. Major new ‌iPad‌ and Mac launches are not expected until 2024, suggesting it will be a slow holiday season for Apple outside of the ‌iPhone‌ and Apple Watch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDuring Apple's August earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri said that Mac and ‌iPad‌ revenue is expected to drop double digits. Last October, Apple introduced the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models and a 10th-generation ‌iPad‌, plus it was still seeing sales of the redesigned <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> during the holidays.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's warning about the ‌iPad‌ and Mac revenue drop suggests that it does not expect to have products to entice customers during the holiday quarter, and that is in line with rumors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is a possibility that we will see <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/09/gurman-october-apple-event-unlikely/\">at least one iPad</a> unveiled in October, perhaps <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/apple-ipad-mini-7-release-late-2023/\">an iPad mini</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>, or an 11th-generation low-cost ‌iPad‌, but these will be minor refreshes. ‌iPad Pro‌ models with OLED displays and M3 chips won't be coming until 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe could also see at least one Mac with a new M3 chip, and this could be a ‌MacBook Air‌, 13-inch MacBook Pro, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, or a 24-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>. Gurman said that if these products do come out in 2023, Apple is likely to unveil them via press release rather than with an event.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile Gurman believes M3 Macs could come out in 2023, Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said recently that Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/\">will not launch</a> new MacBook models with M3 processors before the end of the year, which may narrow down any M3 Mac releases to desktop models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple did not hold an October event last year, but there were October events in 2013, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2021.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/apple-october-event-possibility/\">Will There Be An Apple Event in October?</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/will-there-be-an-apple-event-in-october.2405390/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d1c797d73e41ca1501b53e56a4b35a66274487e2358fb2bb7dc4f6db46063774","category":"Apple"}
