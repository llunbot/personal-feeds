Pok Pok is a delightful collection of digital toys for kids aged 2–7, for both iPhone and iPad. Designed by parents and educators unhappy with the apps they found, Pok Pok has no ads, no overstimulating sounds, and no addictive gimmicks to get kids hooked. It’s just fun. Each toy is playful and open, letting kids explore and discover at their own pace. Existing toys are expanded and new ones are added regularly to keep play fresh.</p>\n\n<p>Pok Pok has won both an Apple Design Award and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apple-unveils-app-store-award-winners-the-best-apps-and-games-of-2023/\">an App Store Award for Cultural Impact just last year</a>. Beautiful graphics, fun sound design, and great haptics. Try Pok Pok for free — you and your kid(s) will love it.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/14/pok-pok\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8fbda3ebc9af06ff2d668d926c739b38c56c81630ae787f65cfd225040fea12e","category":"Tech"}
