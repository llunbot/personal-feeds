The Smudge tool can be accessed from the Adjustment tool options.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Sponge tool can be used to enhance the vibrancy of colors in specific areas of an image, or mute the colors. As with the Smudge tool, the Sponge tool is available by tapping on the Adjustment tools icon.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nToday's update also introduces options for adjusting the white balance for Camera Raw images and there are now labels for the tool icons that can be seen when you over over them.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBoth tools work well with either a finger or an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>, with Adobe recommending an ‌Apple Pencil‌ for the best results.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/ipad.html\">Photoshop for iPad</a> is available through Adobe's Creative Cloud plans, which are priced starting at $9.99 for the Photography plan. The Photography plan includes Lightroom for desktop and mobile, Lightroom Classic, Photoshop on desktop and ‌iPad‌, and 20GB of cloud storage. A Photoshop-only subscription is also available for $20.99 per month, and that plan includes 100GB storage.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photoshop/\">Photoshop</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/adobe/\">Adobe</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/14/photoshop-for-ipad-new-tools/\">Adobe Adds New Smudge and Sponge Tools to Photoshop for iPad</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/adobe-adds-new-smudge-and-sponge-tools-to-photoshop-for-ipad.2327524/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5LAv4u3HOwA:a9GOnNn-4r0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5LAv4u3HOwA:a9GOnNn-4r0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8be99074ca6396d9d07fbd3e50e7e033719701186398fbb7badbd8c9e03c19e4","category":"Apple"}
