This year, Apple itself is also dipping a toe in the deal pool by <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/1305166/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fgifts%2Fshopping-event%3Fafid%3Dp239%257C1305166%26cid%3Daos-us-aff-ir&amp;subid1=ArsBF2021\" target=\"_blank\">offering Apple Gift Cards</a> with select devices on its own online store. If you go that route, note that Apple says it'll send the credit to your email address within 24 hours from the time your purchase ships or is available for pickup.</p>\n<p>Below are the most worthwhile Apple deals we're seeing as of this writing.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1815883#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1815883&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Corey Gaskin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ab527b68cf87a73ec5f87a35144c7783d46bfebfeb61b4ff283cec6f9c1afde7","category":"Tech"}
