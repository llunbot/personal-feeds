Rounding out this year’s coverage, we have a few roundups, starting with the soft good side of the industry. This is by no means an exhaustive list, just a roundup of things I saw along the way… starting with a very interesting bike case. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>B&amp;W Bike Shield</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Packing your bike to travel can be the biggest hassle of a trip. Not surprisingly, we’re starting to see more bike cases that allow you to pack a bike without disassembling the cockpit. Not only does this preserve your precious fit, but it also saves time, allowing you to pull the bike out of the case and get rolling faster. More importantly, with modern road bikes that have completely internal routing and one piece bar/stem combos, you may not even be able to remove the handlebar to pack it. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-02.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-02-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"B&amp;W bike shield travel case\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-02-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-02-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-02-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-02-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-02-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-02-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-02-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This new case from B&amp;W International is pretty interesting that you set the bike in the case upside down, resting on the handlebar and saddle. You can also pack it with the saddle removed for larger bikes, or if you are unable to lower it enough to fit in the case – there is an adjustable rear axle support to hold up the rear end of the bike in that situation. The case on display had some foam blocks under the bars, and you’d probably want to add some protection to the shifter and saddle, but the straps cinch it down to keep it from moving. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-01.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-01-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"B&amp;W bike shield travel case\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-01-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-01-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-01-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-01-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-01-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-01-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-01-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The wheels get strapped to either side of the 3-piece HDPE clamshell design, and there are storage compartments and nets to pack in other gear. With a width of 22.4″ (568mm), the case is best for road or gravel bikes with handlebars narrower than 56cm at the bar ends. Large wheels allow for easy movement through the airport. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The case is not yet on the B&amp;W website, but oddly it is listed for preorder on <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/B-W-International-Bike-Shield-Bicycle-Travel-Case-Black/15973220419?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;selectedSellerId=102663793&amp;selectedOfferId=A887B50F556A3DF2AC42B0B6FC19D8F7&amp;conditionGroupCode=1&amp;gQT=1\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart.com</a> for $977.99 with free shipping, and an estimated delivery of June 3rd. The Bike Shield case itself weighs in at 35.3lbs according to the listing, which means that most bikes will already be over the 50lbs mark by the time it’s packed. You’ll have to keep that in mind, along with the 22.40 x 35.43 x 52.36 size when figuring out if this will qualify for a free checked bag, or will be hit with overweight/oversize fees. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tailfin Bags &amp; Prototypes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-17.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-17-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Tailfin seat tube pack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-17-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-17-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-17-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-17-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-17-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-17-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-17-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From bike-packing to bike packing, Tailfin was on hand at Sea Otter for the first time and their booth was hopping. It was also hiding some new products and unreleased prototypes. The closest to production is this seat tube/top tube bag, which is designed to occupy the triangle of space between the two. This allows you to run a top tube bag up front, this in the back, and still have a small wedge of open space to be able to straddle your top tube. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a

this prototype rear bag which had a roll-top stuff sack integrated into it. It seems like this will be geared towards the bike packing race crowd who want to be able to stuff things into the pack in a hurry, and carry things like a sleeping kit inside instead of on the bars. The white stuff sack indicates that it’s a prototype from Tailfin, so this could change a bit before it sees production. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look closely, there is also a prototype MTB frame bag on the bike which we couldn’t take direct photos of, but… they’re working on it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>HandleStash Insulated Stem Bag for Nalgenes, New Stashsquatch Big Bag</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-04.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-04-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"handlestash Nalgene bar bag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-04-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-04-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-04-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-04-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-04-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-04-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sea-Otter-Roundup-new-clothing-protection-bags-eyewear-04-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving to another small bag company, HandleStash makes their bags in Colorado, and has a new bag for keeping big drinks cold.
