Prices for extra storage in the UK range from £0.99 a month for 50GB of space to £54.99 a month for 12TB.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhich? alleges that the company makes it difficult for customers to use alternative cloud storage providers \"by giving its ‌iCloud‌ storage service preferential treatment,\" and \"'trapping' customers with Apple devices into using ‌iCloud‌.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe consumer group filed the legal action with the Competition Appeal Tribunal, and said it was seeking damages for 40 million Apple users in the UK. If successful, the lawsuit could result in a £70 payout per customer. According to the Consumer Rights Act 2015, all those eligible are automatically included in the claim unless they choose to opt out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhich? said it was urging Apple \"to resolve this claim without the need for litigation by offering consumers their money back and opening up iOS to allow users a real choice for cloud services.\" Which? CEO Anabel Hoult commented: \"Taking this legal action means we can help consumers to get the redress that they are owed, deter similar behaviour in the future and create a better, more competitive market.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple in a statement said it rejected the suggestion that its ‌iCloud‌ practices are anticompetitive, vowing to \"vigorously defend against any legal claim otherwise.\" Apple said it works hard to make data transfer as easy as possible, and that nearly 50% of its customers do not need nor pay for an ‌iCloud‌+ subscription. It added that its pricing was in line with that of other cloud storage providers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Via <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/uk-consumer-group-takes-apple-over-icloud-service-2024-11-14/\">Reuters</a>.)</em><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/14/apple-uk-lawsuit-trapping-icloud-customers/\">Apple Accused of Trapping 40 Million Customers into iCloud Service</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-accused-of-trapping-40-million-customers-into-icloud-service.2442947/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"608a0e676fb74b155993eea647ac4df73911bcfd76bb57e7a95b6fe283dd1fd4","category":"Apple"}
