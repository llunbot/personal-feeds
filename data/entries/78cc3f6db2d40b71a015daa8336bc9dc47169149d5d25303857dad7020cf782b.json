The latest concerns the iPhone 16 Pro Max and we can’t wait to see it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/universeice/status/1798245080844914918?s=61&amp;t=qBmg-jYMYmWqLDcIYTe2iA&amp;xcust=1-1-2358851-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Ice Universe on X</a> (formerly Twitter), the iPhone 16 Pro Max will have similar dimensions to the iPhone 15 Pro Max despite sporting a larger screen for the first time since the iPhone 12 (6.9 inches vs 6.7 inches):</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max:</strong> 163 × 77.6 × 8.26mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max:</strong> 160 x 76.7 x 8.25mm</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ice Universe reported earlier this week that the iPhone 16 Pro will have the thinnest bezels ever in a smartphone, with a 1.153mm border around the screen which they say will be “the world’s closest smartphone to a borderless sci-fi form factor.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last time Apple increased the size of the iPhone Pro Max was with the 12 series when it jumped from 6.5 inches to 6.7 inches, which resulted in a similar increase in dimensions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPhone 11 Pro Max:</strong> 158 x 77.8 x 8.1 mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 12 Pro Max:</strong> 161 x 78.1 x 7.4 mm</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While the iPhone 16 Pro Max will be the largest iPhone Apple has ever made, the number that stands out is the thickness, which Ice Universe claims will remain roughly the same on the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Back when the iPhone 12 launched, Apple trimmed the thickness considerably, but won’t be reducing it here. With the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/2024-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">iPad Pro</a>, device thinness has taken on a new importance, so it’s a little surprising that Apple couldn’t reduce the thickness to under 8 millimeters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the 6.9-inch iPhone 16 Pro Max will feel incredibly thin, especially with the weight reduction that we got last year with the switch to titanium. Apple is expected to release the iPhone 16 at an event in September.
