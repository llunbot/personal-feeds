As of March, the only three states to support it were <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/23/apple-launches-ids-in-wallet-arizona/\">Arizona</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/25/iphone-drivers-license-wallet-app-maryland/\">Maryland</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/09/colorado-ids-wallet-app-support/\">Colorado</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo add an ID to the ‌iPhone‌, Georgia residents can tap the \"+\" button in the top-right corner of the Wallet app and follow the on-screen instructions. Georgia's FAQ on the feature notes that residents must continue to carry their physical driver's license or ID card with them, as the digital version is a companion to the physical card, not a replacement.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe feature is available in the U.S. only and requires an ‌iPhone‌ 8 or later running iOS 15.4 or later, or an Apple Watch Series 4 or later running watchOS 8.4 or later. Apple has yet to indicate whether the feature will launch in additional countries in the future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGeorgia's press release does not that it could take \"up to 48 hours\" for Georgia to appear as an option in Apple Wallet, so be patient if it's not yet showing for you.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor now, IDs in the Wallet app can only be presented at select TSA checkpoints at select U.S. airports, with Apple advising travelers to check TSA checkpoint signage to confirm availability. Georgia's FAQ on the feature indicates that it is supported at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAfter a driver's license or ID has been added to the Wallet app, users can simply tap their ‌iPhone‌ or Apple Watch on an identity reader at a TSA checkpoint, without taking out their physical card. Users will see a prompt on their device displaying the specific information being requested by the TSA, and only after authorizing with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> is the requested identity information released from their device, according to Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUsers do not need to unlock, show, or hand over their device to a TSA officer to present their mobile driver's license or ID, according to Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple said the feature is designed with privacy and security in mind. When adding an ID to the Wallet app, users are required to take a photo of their face, which will be securely provided to the issuing state for verification. Users are also prompted to complete a series of facial and head movements during the setup process.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/\">Apple Wallet</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/18/iphone-drivers-license-georgia/\">iPhone Driver's License Feature in Wallet App Now Available in Georgia</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-drivers-license-feature-in-wallet-app-now-available-in-georgia.2389882/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7bd29a31bf33bcb3e3cf230d65437c0e61723957ddb7ff56e949f629a451beeb","category":"Apple"}
