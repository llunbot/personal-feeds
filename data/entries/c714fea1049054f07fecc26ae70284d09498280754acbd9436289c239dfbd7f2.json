It's on the underside of the RF board, and has the same package structure as the Qualcomm X71M modem, with a 4nm modem and DRAM. The 7nm transceivers are not located in the same package as the modem.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niFixit was not impressed with some of the design decisions that Apple made, due to the repair difficulty. To get to the USB-C port, for example, all of the internal components of the device need to be removed. Still, iFixit said that the ‌iPhone 16e‌ makes some progress toward repairability thanks to the rollback of parts pairing in iOS and small changes like a metal bracket that protects a flex cable from being sliced when opening up the device.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ifixit/\">iFixit</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e\">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/03/iphone-16e-teardown-ifixit/\">iFixit Takes Apart iPhone 16e for Closer Look at C1 Modem</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixit-takes-apart-iphone-16e-for-closer-look-at-c1-modem.2451245/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c714fea1049054f07fecc26ae70284d09498280754acbd9436289c239dfbd7f2","category":"Apple"}
