Orbs take photos of a user’s eyeballs, creating a unique code that can be used to claim free digital tokens.</p>\n<p>The project’s developers said on Thursday they planned to release hundreds of orbs in the coming months and eventually distribute 4,000 devices per month. The team plans to debut the cryptocurrency network early next year and begin giving away the tokens at that time. They have not said how much cryptocurrency users can expect to receive.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806743#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806743&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Bangeman","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"01e0b6eee7210628cc378ffc1d82499e7caeade6c40f547b33e96340599c5121","category":"Tech"}
