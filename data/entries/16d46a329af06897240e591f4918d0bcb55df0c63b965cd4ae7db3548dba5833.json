Long and lean and angular, it has a distinctly Lexus feel despite its unique look.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978397#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978397&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"16d46a329af06897240e591f4918d0bcb55df0c63b965cd4ae7db3548dba5833","category":"Tech"}
