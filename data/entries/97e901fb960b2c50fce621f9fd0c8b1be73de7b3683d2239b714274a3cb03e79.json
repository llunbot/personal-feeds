Apple has several demonstration areas set up, but as of right now, media attendees can only see the device and aren't able to try it out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-vision-headset.jpg\" alt width=\"3024\" height=\"1700\" />\r<br />\nThe headset has a futuristic, sleek look, with Apple mounting the devices on stands to give the media a closer look. The external battery pack can be clearly seen connected to the headset through a cable at the side of the device. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nDesign wise, the headset is not unlike a pair of ski goggles, featuring a wrap-around display that's held against the face by a soft mesh and a seal that keeps out the light. The headband is made from a soft, braided material that's meant to be comfortable to wear for longer periods of time. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/tim-cook-vision-pro.jpg\" alt width=\"3024\" height=\"4032\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/headset-battery-pack.jpg\" alt width=\"3024\" height=\"1700\" />\r<br />\nThere is no word yet on whether media attendees will be given a chance to test out the headset today or later this week, but there is a good chance that we'll soon be seeing some first impressions. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Oh hey Tim Cook! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWDC23?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WWDC23</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Apple</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/8yUyQoVWuJ\">pic.twitter.com/8yUyQoVWuJ</a></p>â€” Dan Barbera (@danbarbera) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danbarbera/status/1665815911633399809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 5, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nApple's Vision Pro headset will not be available for purchase until early 2024, and it will be incredibly expensive at $3,499. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/\">AR/VR Headset</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/apple-vision-pro-in-person/\">Here's a First In-Person Look at the Apple Vision Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-a-first-in-person-look-at-the-apple-vision-pro.2391700/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"97e901fb960b2c50fce621f9fd0c8b1be73de7b3683d2239b714274a3cb03e79","category":"Apple"}
