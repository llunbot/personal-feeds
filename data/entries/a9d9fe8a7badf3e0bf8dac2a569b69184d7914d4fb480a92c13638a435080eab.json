{"title":"Andy Grove in 2000: ‘What I’ve Learned’","link":"https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/interviews/a1449/learned-andy-grove-0500/","date":1733279488000,"content":"\n<p>A few nuggets of wisdom from Andy Grove, in an interview with Esquire after he retired as Intel’s CEO, but still served as chairman:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Profits are the lifeblood of enterprise.</em> Don’t let anyone tell\nyou different.</p>\n\n<p><em>You must understand your mistakes.</em> Study the hell out of them.\nYou’re not going to have the chance of making the same mistake\nagain — you can’t step into the river again at the same place and\nthe same time — but you will have the chance of making a similar\nmistake.</p>\n\n<p><em>Status is a very dangerous thing.</em> I’ve met too many people who\nmake it a point of pride that they never take money out of a cash\nmachine, people who are too good to have their own e-mail address,\nbecause that’s for everybody else but not them. It’s hard to fight\nthe temptation to set yourself apart from the rest of the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Grove, still serving as CEO during Intel’s zenith in 1997, didn’t even have an office. <a href=\"https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/companies-executives/article/21963786/1997-technology-leader-of-the-year-andy-grove-building-an-information-age-legacy\">He worked out of an 8x9-foot cubicle</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>What you’re seeing today is a very, very rapid evolution</em> of an\nindustry where the milieu is better understood by people who grew\nup in the same time frame as the industry. A lot of the years that\nmany of us have spent in business before this time are of only\nlimited relevance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This industry is not like any other. Computers don’t get incrementally more powerful; they get exponentially more powerful.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/03/grove-2006-interview\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a9d9fe8a7badf3e0bf8dac2a569b69184d7914d4fb480a92c13638a435080eab","category":"Tech"}
