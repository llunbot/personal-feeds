For most shoppers, however, the deal should apply automatically.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt's been just over a year since we last tracked deals on iTunes gift cards, because Apple phased those out in favor of the new Apple Gift Card. This makes Amazon's sale today of particular note, since you won't find a straight cash discount on these cards again, but can at least get credit added to your Amazon account.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Gift-Card-accessories-Delivery/dp/B08F3C99KN\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$10 CREDIT</div>$100 Apple Gift Card at Amazon</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAll of the Apple Gift Cards <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/promotion/psp/AR4JLSOCV1WQ4?redirectAsin=B08F3C99KN&amp;redirectMerchantId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;ref=sopp_psp_AR4JLSOCV1WQ4\">on this page</a> are supported under the new promotion, as long as you customize one to be worth $100 or more.
