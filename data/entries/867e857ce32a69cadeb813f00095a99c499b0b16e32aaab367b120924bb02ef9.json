The data show that human-driven cars are more than twice as likely to get into a crash that is reported to the police. And depending on how you do the math, </span><span>human-driven cars are four to seven times more likely to get into crashes that lead to an injury.</span></p>\n<p>Through October 2023, driverless Waymo vehicles have had only three crashes with injuries—two in the Phoenix area and one in San Francisco. Waymo says all three injuries were minor. If those same miles had been driven by typical human drivers in the same cities, we would have expected around 13 injury crashes.</p>\n<p><span>The new data comes at a crucial time for the self-driving industry.
