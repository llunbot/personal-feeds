Apple was criticized for only offering one Vision Pro test spot in the United States, for example, as people from the east coast were required to travel all the way to Cupertino.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith a Vision Pro developer lab now in New York, developers on the east coast of the United States will not need to travel as far, nor will developers in Australia. Any developer can apply to attend a Vision Pro lab, but Apple is not reimbursing for travel.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt the Vision Pro developer labs, developers are provided with hands-on time with the Vision Pro headset as well as help from Apple engineers. The labs provide opportunities for testing and optimization for ‌visionOS‌ apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has also sent <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/24/apple-vision-pro-developer-kits-now-available/\">Vision Pro developer kits</a> to some developers, but the developer kits are available in limited quantities and Apple is prioritizing apps that best take advantage of the Vision Pro features and capabilities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDevelopers still have several months to work on ‌visionOS‌ apps before the headset launches, as it is set to come out in early 2024 in the United States. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/\">Apple Developer Program</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/apple-vision-pro-lab-new-york-sydney/\">Apple Expands Vision Pro Test Labs to New York City and Sydney</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expands-vision-pro-test-labs-to-new-york-city-and-sydney.2407889/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6ec16d0f52c1164467b92069433ee747d01f96ff830cc44938cb7f84cb6bfeba","category":"Apple"}
