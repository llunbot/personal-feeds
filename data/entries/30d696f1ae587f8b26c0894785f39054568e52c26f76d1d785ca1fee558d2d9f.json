However, it is still said to be several years away from being introduced in a future Apple Watch model.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 8</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent/\">Patent</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/23/apple-watch-match-watch-face-color-to-band-clothes/\">Future Apple Watch Sensors May Match Watch Face Color to Your Band and Clothes</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/future-apple-watch-sensors-may-match-watch-face-color-to-your-band-and-clothes.2399395/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"30d696f1ae587f8b26c0894785f39054568e52c26f76d1d785ca1fee558d2d9f","category":"Apple"}
