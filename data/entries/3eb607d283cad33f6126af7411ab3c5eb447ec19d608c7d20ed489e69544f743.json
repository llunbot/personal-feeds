Nine kerosene-fueled Merlin engines powered the first stage of the flight on a trajectory northeast from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, then the booster detached and returned to landing at Cape Canaveral as the Falcon 9's upper stage accelerated SpaceX's Crew Dragon <em>FreedomÂ </em>spacecraft into orbit.</p>\n<p>\"It was a sweet ride,\" Hague said after arriving in space. With a seemingly flawless launch, Hague and Gorbunov are on track to arrive at the space station around 5:30 pm EDT (2130 UTC) Sunday.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053288#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053288&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3eb607d283cad33f6126af7411ab3c5eb447ec19d608c7d20ed489e69544f743","category":"Tech"}
