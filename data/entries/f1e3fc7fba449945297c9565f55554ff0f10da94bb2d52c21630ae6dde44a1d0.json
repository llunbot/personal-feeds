In <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453.121.0_1.pdf\">a letter to the court</a> posted as part of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/ftc-appeal-in-microsoft-activision-case-shows-us-regulator-isnt-giving-up-yet/\">an ongoing appeal by the FTC</a> in the case, the federal regulator alleges Microsoft's moves are a clear example of \"product degradation\" brought about by \"a firm exercising market power post-merger.\"</p>\n<p>The letter's primary focus is on the soon-to-be-discontinued $10.99/month Console Game Pass tier. That's being replaced with a $14.99/month Game Pass Standard tier (a 36 percent price increase) that no longer includes \"day one\" access to all of Microsoft's first-party titles. To maintain that key benefit, \"Console\" subscribers will have to spend 81 percent more for the $19.99 Game Pass Ultimate tier, which also includes a number of additional benefits over the current $10.99/month option.</p>\n<h2>Is this “based on the acquisition”?</h2>\n<p>The FTC notes that these changes \"coincide with adding <em>Call of Duty</em> to Game Pass’s most expensive tier.\" Previously, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/sony-calls-microsofts-3-year-call-of-duty-sharing-offer-inadequate/\">Microsoft publicly promised</a> that this Game Pass access to Activision's ultra-popular shooter would come \"with no price increase for the service based on the acquisition.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038127#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038127&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f1e3fc7fba449945297c9565f55554ff0f10da94bb2d52c21630ae6dde44a1d0","category":"Tech"}
