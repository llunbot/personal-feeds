A steel archway sign hangs over the walkway and on the wall to the left sits a round, blue plaque. ‘Beryl Burton OBE was a cycling phenomenon,’ says the opening sentence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeffrey Charnock is Burton’s younger brother by nine years and is accompanying me on what becomes an emotional tour through their early life. He pauses to re-read the plaque before ushering us around the corner to the back wall of the Yorkshire Bank and what is a quite stunning 60 foot-wide mural. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morley is three miles south of Leeds city centre and, following her death in 1996, Burton was depicted by local artists just as most people will remember her: alone, crouched over the handlebars, resplendent in her pale blue and white Morley Cycling Club kit, and time-trialling along at an unfathomable speed. Even the idiosyncratic kink in her riding style – right hand always slightly higher than her left – is captured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the passers-by glance up at the depiction of a woman whose achievements, in cycling circles, gave this market town of 44,000 people a proud global resonance. Others hurry past. None are aware that the man dutifully clearing up a few nearby pieces of litter is her sibling.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"737\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-02-970x737.jpg\" alt=\"Beryl Burton\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-02-970x737.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-02-300x228.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-02-768x584.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-02-750x570.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-02-1140x866.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Beryl Burton’s daughter Denise in front of the mural to her mother in Morley</figcaption><figcaption>Bernard Thompson / Mal Rees / Cycling Time Trials</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Having ensured that the gardens are again spotless, Charnock pauses to absorb the mural. ‘People just see the cyclist,’ he says finally. ‘I don’t. I see the girl that she was. I see the woman that she became. And then I see all the achievements. I know what shaped her and what she went through to get there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘People sometimes also get it wrong about Beryl. They focus on how she was so driven and single-minded – which she was. Or they portray her as very stern – which she could be. But there was so much more: she was kind and funny – not always intentionally, but she had a dry sense of humour. She was complex. Unique.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>‘A stubborn little mule’</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask Charnock to name the most staggering achievement of what was arguably the most staggering cycling career of all and he does not hesitate. It was not Beryl Burton’s seven world titles. It was not even the iconic 12-hour record that stood for 50 years and exceeded even what the men could achieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, for him, the achievement that surpasses all others was his sister winning what was then the blue riband national women’s championship, the British Best All-Rounder (BAR) for the fastest average speed over 25, 50 and 100 miles, for a continuous quarter of a century between 1959 and 1983.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"806\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-03-970x806.jpg\" alt=\"Beryl Burton\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-03-970x806.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-03-300x249.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-03-768x638.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-03-750x623.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-03-1140x947.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Bernard Thompson / Mal Rees / Cycling Time Trials</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It was the crowning glory in Beryl Burton’s career and encapsulates a relentless obsession to not just be the best, but devote everything she had to the sport she loved. And with 2023 being the 40th anniversary of her 25th consecutive BAR win, it feels like the ideal moment to reflect on the origins of that fierce motivation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An early school report describes Beryl Charnock, as she was then, as ‘a stubborn little mule’ and she was academically at the top of her class when, overcome by a burning desire to succeed, she froze just as her 11-plus examination began in October 1947. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She developed a high fever, collapsed and was rushed to St James’s Hospital in Leeds where she was diagnosed with Sydenham’s chorea and rheumatic fever. It had been a life-threatening attack of the nervous system. ‘I was shattered – an abject failure,’ she later said.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"685\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-04-685x970.jpg\" alt=\"Beryl Burton\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-04-685x970.jpg 685w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-04-212x300.jpg 212w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-04-768x1087.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-04-1085x1536.jpg 1085w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-04-750x1062.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-04-1140x1614.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Bernard Thompson / Mal Rees / Cycling Time Trials</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Paralysed down one side of her body, barely able to speak and unable to control sudden involuntary movements, the young Beryl didn’t leave Ward 19 of the hospital for nine months, and would spend a further 15 in a Southport convalescent home run by nuns. Family visits weren’t allowed, even over Christmas. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After spending her 12th birthday 73 miles from her family in Leeds, she was finally declared fit enough to return home. ‘I felt as though I had been cheated. I was determined that somehow I would make my mark,’ she would later say.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding cycling and winning 122 national titles</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Charlie Burton, a member of what was then the Morley Road Club (later the Morley Cycling Club), worked in the same factory as Beryl after she left school and invited her on one of their Sunday morning club runs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the horrors and restrictions of war, it was a time of rapid growth in recreational clubs and, with few families owning a car, the bike represented a means to explore. The Morley cyclists would cover uncommonly large distances, regularly undertaking day-long rides through the Yorkshire Dales and even the Lake District, so it was a tough apprenticeship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did Beryl enjoy it? Her response in an interview some 30 years later was revealing. ‘I can’t recall,’ she said. ‘What I do remember is that I wasn’t going to be beaten by anything.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"747\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-05-970x747.jpg\" alt=\"Beryl Burton\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-05-970x747.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-05-300x231.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-05-768x591.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-05-750x578.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-05-1140x878.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Bernard Thompson / Mal Rees / Cycling Time Trials</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Charlie, now 93, had lent Beryl a bike for those early rides and remembers how, in the first year, he would push her up the hills. By the second year, she was staying up with a group containing some of Yorkshire’s strongest male cyclists. And by the third year? ‘She were leaving us behind,’ he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By that point, Charlie and Beryl were married and, following the birth of daughter Denise in 1956, Beryl began competing in national time-trial events.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"373\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-06-970x373.jpg\" alt=\"Beryl Burton\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-06-970x373.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-06-300x115.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-06-768x295.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-06-750x288.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-06-1140x438.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Bernard Thompson / Mal Rees / Cycling Time Trials</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A sixth place behind Millie Robinson in the British 25-mile championships of 1957 demonstrated a fierce hatred of losing – ‘I had a good cry’ – but also an expectation that she would become the best. Burton was only 20 but directly approached Robinson – one of the world’s leading cyclists, having won the first women’s Tour de France in 1955 – to warn that the outcome would be different the following year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burton duly returned in 1958 to not just keep her promise and win that 25-mile title, but begin a dominance of the event that would see her win it 26 times by 1986. Her domestic supremacy would see her claim a total of 122 national championships over her career, hence why many view her as the best female cyclist of all time.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-07-970x706.jpg\" alt=\"Beryl Burton\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-07-970x706.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-07-300x219.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-07-768x559.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-07-120x86.jpg 120w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-07-750x546.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-07-1140x830.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-07.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Bernard Thompson / Mal Rees / Cycling Time Trials</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>From 1959 until 1973, Burton also won 15 World Championships medals – including seven gold – against rivals from nations such as the Soviet Union, East Germany and Belgium, who were training full time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was a luxury never afforded to Burton, who turned down overtures from Raleigh to remain strictly amateur through her whole career, continuing to work full time on a rhubarb farm throughout.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"722\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-08-722x970.jpg\" alt=\"Beryl Burton\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-08-722x970.jpg 722w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-08-223x300.jpg 223w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-08-768x1032.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-08-1143x1536.jpg 1143w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-08-750x1008.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-08-1140x1532.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-08.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Bernard Thompson / Mal Rees / Cycling Time Trials</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘If I didn’t work, I didn’t do the cycling,’ said Burton in 1994. ‘When you were racing, you just prayed that you didn’t puncture because you knew that you didn’t have enough money out of the next week’s wages to buy a new tyre. But I think if you want to do something so badly, you will always manage to cope.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her daily routine – cycle to work, spend the day effectively strength training by bending, lifting, digging and packing rhubarb before interval training at night behind random lorries and wagons on the A1 to Doncaster – was gruelling, but immensively effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conquering the world</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"869\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-09-869x970.jpg\" alt=\"Beryl Burton\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-09-869x970.jpg 869w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-09-269x300.jpg 269w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-09-768x858.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-09-750x838.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-09-1140x1273.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-09.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Burton became the first cyclist to win world titles on road and track when she took the pursuit and road race honours in dominant fashion in 1960</figcaption><figcaption>Bernard Thompson / Mal Rees / Cycling Time Trials</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Burton’s greatest global performance would come in the 1960 World Championships in East Germany. The final of the 3,000m pursuit, against Marie-Thérèse Naessens of Belgium, was captured by a German documentary film and shows Charlie – dressed in trousers, a white shirt and sandals – roaring his wife to victory from the side of the track in a world record time of 4min 6.1sec.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burton later described that race as the most extraordinary atmosphere of her career, and the footage – flags waving, a band playing and 25,000 spectators rising to deliver a rapturous standing ovation – bears incredible witness to her recollections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were several clear days after the pursuit series before the women’s Road Race World Championships, which was held a further 65 miles south of Leipzig at the Sachsenring motor-racing circuit in front of 65,000 fans. Having crossed the line at the very front of the bunch after each of the first three laps, Burton upped the pace on the cobbled climb during the fourth lap. It wasn’t a sudden burst of effort but, rather like a boa constrictor slowly shutting down the life of its prey, the cumulative impact proved deadly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final gap to the rest of the field was a colossal 3min 37sec, a winning margin that even the most celebrated male riders of the era such as Fausto Coppi or Eddy Merckx were never able to emulate over much longer distances.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-10-970x970.jpg\" alt=\"Beryl Burton\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-10-970x970.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-10-300x300.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-10-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-10-768x768.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-10-75x75.jpg 75w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-10-350x350.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-10-750x750.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-10-1140x1140.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-10.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Bernard Thompson / Mal Rees / Cycling Time Trials</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>No cyclist had previously won gold on both the road and the track.

Asked whether it was beating the men’s 12-hour record and winning her seventh world title in the space of three weeks in 1967 that stood out most, Burton simply replied, ‘It was the moment which counted. I savoured that. There are some who would say that the 1967 season was the best. The pinnacle. Maybe so, maybe no. For me, I enjoyed them all.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adapted from <a href=\"In Search Of Britain’s Greatest Athlete\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Beryl:</em> <em>In Search Of Britain’s Greatest Athlete</em></a> by Jeremy Wilson, the 2022 William Hill Sports Book of the Year</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<h2>Beryl Burton: Career highlights</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1937:</strong> Born Beryl Charnock on 12th May in Halton, Leeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1957:</strong> Wins silver in the British 10-mile TT championship, her first national medal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1958: </strong>Claims the first of 26 titles in the British 25-mile championship.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"719\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-13-970x719.jpg\" alt=\"Beryl Burton\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-13-970x719.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-13-300x223.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-13-768x570.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-13-750x556.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-13-1140x846.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-13.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Bernard Thompson / Mal Rees / Cycling Time Trials</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>1959: </strong>Takes the first of five world titles on the track in the pursuit.

She held records that defied cycling’s aerodynamic revolution to remain intact across a span of six decades between 1958 and 2017. But with modern aerodynamic kit, would those records still be standing to this day?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aerodynamics expert Xavier Disley attempted to answer this last year when he tested Burton’s TI-Raleigh steel road bike against a modern carbon fibre time-trial machine in a wind-tunnel at Silverstone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The experiment required an experienced cyclist who could consistently hold Burton’s low ‘tucked’ position, and Jessica Rhodes-Jones, amateur World Time-Trial Champion in 2017 and 2021, volunteered, even wearing a short curly wig.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-17-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Beryl Burton\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-17-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-17-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-17-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-17-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-17-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-17-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-17-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/beryl-burton-17.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Bernard Thompson / Mal Rees / Cycling Time Trials</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>By mounting each bike inside the wind-tunnel, Disley could calculate how efficiently bike and rider were together. Once he had the drag coefficient for each setup, he could benchmark what Burton’s records would look like for the same power using modern kit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the table shows, Burton’s adjusted times over what were her three core distances – 25, 50 and 100 miles – are decisively faster than any rider has managed since, while her adjusted 12-hour record would still be 15 miles more than the current record. ‘I just can’t think of another sportsperson whose athletic feats have remained so measurably outstanding,’ says Disley.</p>\n\n\n\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Distance</td><td>Burton's previous record</td><td>Burton, new time on modern setup</td><td>Current record</td><td>Difference to current record</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>25 miles</td><td>53:21sec (17th June 1976)</td><td>47:52sec</td><td>49:28sec (Hayley Simmonds)</td><td>Burton still up by 1:36sec (after 47 years)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>50 miles</td><td>1:51:30sec (25th July 1976)</td><td>1:41:06sec</td><td>1:42:20sec (Hayley Simmonds)</td><td>Burton still up by 1:14sec (after 47 years)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>100 miles</td><td>3:55:05sec (4th August 1968)</td><td>3:33:16sec</td><td>3:42:03sec (Alice Lethbridge)</td><td>Burton still up by 8:47sec (after 55 years)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>12 hours</td><td>277.25 miles (17th September 1967)</td><td>305.23 miles</td><td>290.07 miles (Alice Lethbridge)</td><td>Burton still up by 15.16 miles (after 56 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/beryl-burton-cyclist\">‘A cycling phenomenon’: Remembering Beryl Burton, Britain’s greatest rider</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"71d5bbb9cc0f7edc46d70a5a3ae66326d735bf489fe080662c7f0fc0ddbc84c4","category":"Cycling"}
