ARC (Audio Return Channel) is a feature of HDMI 1.4 that enables audio from a device to be sent to a compatible TV and relayed through its HDMI port to a separate audio receiver, speaker, or sound bar. Meanwhile, eARC (enhanced ARC) adds support for the passthrough of higher bandwidth audio like Dolby Atmos, as well as 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn Apple TV 4K, ARC and eARC support effectively allows a HomePod or HomePod mini (or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/create-homepod-mini-stereo-pair/\">stereo-paired Homepods</a> in a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/set-up-home-theater-audio-homepod-apple-tv-4k/\">Home Theater Audio setup</a>) to play audio from other TV-connected devices like a cable box, PS5, or Xbox Series X.
