While AI has previously bested humans in games like chess, <em>Go</em>, and even <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/an-ai-crushed-two-human-pros-at-starcraft-but-it-wasnt-a-fair-fight/\"><em>StarCraft</em></a>, this may be the first time an AI system has outperformed human pilots in a physical sport.</p>\n\n<p>FPV drone racing is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_racing\">sport</a> where competitors attempt to pilot high-speed drones through an obstacle course as fast as possible. Pilots control the drones remotely while wearing a headset that provides a video feed from an onboard camera, giving them a first-person view from the drone's perspective.</p>\n<p>The researchers at the University of Zürich (UZH) have been trying to craft an ideal AI-powered drone pilot <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/zurich-autonomous-drone-race\">for years</a>, but they previously needed help from a special motion-capture system to take the win. Recently, they came up with an autonomous breakthrough based largely on machine vision, putting the AI system on a more even footing with a human pilot.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964650#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964650&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c2c3b691c38ed020cab5005982102be066c043cdda80f9aaa65df39ba201532e","category":"Tech"}
