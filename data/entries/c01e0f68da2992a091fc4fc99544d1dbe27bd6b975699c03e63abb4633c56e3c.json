And there have been attempts to run <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/09/how-the-le-mans-hydrogen-racer-is-shaping-up/\">a hydrogen-powered racer from Garage 56</a>. But this year's entry is a bit different—and a little more familiar to Americans. It's a NASCAR stock car.</p>\n<p>It was certainly an incongruous sight as the NASCAR stock cars took to the track this weekend with the normal prototypes and GT cars at a test held before next weekend's race at Le Mans. NASCAR stock cars are not exactly small, and they're known for going fast in a straight line, not for their cornering prowess. There was even talk of trackside marshals waving a white flag—for a slow car ahead—to warn other competitors if they were going to encounter the stock car in one of the track's more curvy sections.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944471#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944471&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
