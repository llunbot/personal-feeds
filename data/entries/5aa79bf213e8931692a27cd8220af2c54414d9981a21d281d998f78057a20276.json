By comparison, sub-6GHz 5G is generally slower than mmWave, but the signals travel further, better serving suburban and rural areas.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe 10-megapixel Ultra Wide rear camera on the last three iPad Pro generations is also absent on the latest models, which only have a 12-megapixel Wide rear camera.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs we previously noted, cellular configurations of the latest iPad Pro and iPad Air models also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/2024-ipad-air-ipad-pro-no-sim-slot/\">lack a physical SIM card slot</a>, making them eSIM-only devices.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/\">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/new-ipad-pro-lacks-mmwave-5g-and-ultra-wide-camera/\">New iPad Pro Lacks mmWave 5G and Ultra-Wide Camera</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipad-pro-lacks-mmwave-5g-and-ultra-wide-camera.2425651/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5aa79bf213e8931692a27cd8220af2c54414d9981a21d281d998f78057a20276","category":"Apple"}
