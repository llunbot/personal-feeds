Around two months ago, the company decided to cap all Google Drive users to 5 million files, even if they were paying for extra storage. The company did this in the worst way possible, rolling out the limit as a complete surprise and with no prior communication. Some users logged in to find they were suddenly millions of files over the new limit and unable to upload new files until they deleted enough to get under the limit. Some of these users <a href=\"https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/268606830#comment2\">were businesses</a> that had the sudden file cap bring down their systems, and because Google never communicated that the change was coming, many people initially thought the limitation was a bug.</p>\n<p>Apparently, sunshine really is the best disinfectant. The story made the tech news rounds on Friday, and Ars <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/google-drive-does-a-surprise-rollout-of-file-limits-locking-out-some-users/\">got Google</a> on the record saying that the file cap was not a bug and was actually \"a safeguard to prevent misuse of our system in a way that might impact the stability and safety of the system.\" After the weekend reaction to \"Google Drive's Secret File Cap!\" Google announced <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=100098X1555750&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.3.0-stackpath&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D1928856%26action%3Dedit&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fgoogledrive%2Fstatus%2F1643049029251776515%3Fref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=815fa35a64b9c9910812918583382831&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D\">on Twitter</a> Monday night that it was rolling back the limit:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We recently rolled out a system update to Drive item limits to preserve stability and optimize performance. While this impacted only a small number of people, we are rolling back this change as we explore alternate approaches to ensure a great experience for all.</p>\n<p>— Google Drive (@googledrive) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/googledrive/status/1643049029251776515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Google told us it initially rolled the limitation out to stop what it called \"misuse\" of Drive, and with the tweet saying Google wants to \"explore alternate approaches to ensure a great experience for all,\" it sounds like we might see more kinds of Drive limitations in the future. Google has been on a cost-cutting mission over the past year, and it sounds like the company wants to do something to cut off the most resource-intensive Drive users.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928856#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928856&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"51f58c988d09293a4c2c629a3b0c52f9e22af3a3f1b40b59021ac5a3ad8aec76","category":"Tech"}
