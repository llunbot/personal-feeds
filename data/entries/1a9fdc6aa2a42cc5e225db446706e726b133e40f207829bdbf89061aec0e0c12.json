While the sentiment only applies to one continent (and not all of it) and only certain devices, the Common Charger Directive now in effect in the European Union suggests that far fewer gadgets will foist barrels, USB-micro, or proprietary plugs onto their owners.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C_202402997\">Common Charger Directive</a> demands that a \"USB-C receptacle\" be equipped on \"radio equipment\" that is \"equipped with a removable or embedded rechargeable battery\" and \"can be recharged via wired charging.\" If it has a battery and can be powered by up to 100 watts through a USB-C connection, it's generally subject to the EU's USB-C requirements. The directive applies to devices \"placed on the market\"—sent to a distributor or buyer—after December 28, even if they were initially designed and sold before that date.</p>\n<p>Laptops get until April 2026 to comply, but most other things—phones, tablets, handheld gaming devices, computer accessories, and wireless headphones—will have to be powered by USB-C to be sold inside the EU from now on. Drones, for the time being, are largely unaddressed by the directive, but the EU will likely get around to them.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/usb-c-is-now-a-legal-requirement-for-most-rechargeable-gadgets-in-europe/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/usb-c-is-now-a-legal-requirement-for-most-rechargeable-gadgets-in-europe/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1a9fdc6aa2a42cc5e225db446706e726b133e40f207829bdbf89061aec0e0c12","category":"Tech"}
