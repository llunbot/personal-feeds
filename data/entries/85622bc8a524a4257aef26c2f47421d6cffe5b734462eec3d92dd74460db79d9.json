The company is calling the product the world's first \"smart binoculars,\" and they come with a <a href=\"https://www.swarovskioptik.com/us/en/hunting/products/binoculars/ax-visio/ax-visio-binoculars/ax-visio\">hefty price tag</a>—$4,799.</p>\n<p>\"The AX Visio are the world’s first AI-supported binoculars,\" the company says in the product's press release. \"At the touch of a button, they assist with the identification of birds and other creatures, allow discoveries to be shared, and offer a wide range of practical extra functions.\"</p>\n<figure>\n    <div>\n            </div>\n    </figure>\n<p>The binoculars, aimed mostly at bird watchers, gain their ability to identify birds from the <a href=\"https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/\">Merlin Bird ID</a> project, created by Cornell Lab of Ornithology. As confirmed by a hands-on demo conducted by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24032871/ai-binoculars-swarovski-optic-ax-visio-ces-price-release-date\">The Verge</a>, the user looks at an animal through the binoculars and presses a button. A red progress circle fills in while the binoculars process the image, then the identified animal name pops up on the built-in binocular HUD screen within about five seconds.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995873#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995873&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"85622bc8a524a4257aef26c2f47421d6cffe5b734462eec3d92dd74460db79d9","category":"Tech"}
