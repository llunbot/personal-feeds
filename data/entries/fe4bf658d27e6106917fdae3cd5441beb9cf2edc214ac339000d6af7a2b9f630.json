Wider use of these batteries could lead to lower costs, less fire risk, and less need for lithium, cobalt, and nickel.</p>\n<p>On November 18, CATL, the worldâ€™s largest battery manufacturer, <a href=\"https://www.ess-news.com/2024/11/28/new-sodium-ion-developments-from-catl-byd-huawei/\">announced its second-generation sodium-ion battery</a>, mass production of which would <a href=\"https://carnewschina.com/2024/11/18/catl-announces-second-generation-sodium-battery-normal-discharge-at-40c/\">begin in 2027</a>. The China-based company said the new battery has an energy density of 200 watt-hours per kilogram, which is an increase from 160 watt-hours per kilogram for the previous generation that launched in 2021. Higher energy density in an EV battery translates into more driving range.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 21, a consortium of seven US national laboratories <a href=\"https://www.anl.gov/article/a-new-era-for-batteries-argonne-leads-50m-sodiumion-innovation-push\">announced a new initiative</a> in which they would spend $50 million to foster collaboration to accelerate the development of sodium-ion batteries. The partnership is led by Argonne National Laboratory in the Chicago area.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/lower-cost-sodium-ion-batteries-are-finally-having-their-moment/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/lower-cost-sodium-ion-batteries-are-finally-having-their-moment/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Gearino, Inside Climate News","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fe4bf658d27e6106917fdae3cd5441beb9cf2edc214ac339000d6af7a2b9f630","category":"Tech"}
