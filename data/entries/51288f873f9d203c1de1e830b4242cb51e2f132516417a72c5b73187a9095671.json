This year, the company brought several. At a busy reveal at the brand's Genesis House in Manhattan, it showed us its high-performance ambitions with not one but four bright orange machines, plus one rather famous Belgian racing driver. Then, in a chamber reminiscent of <em><a href=\"https://airandspace.si.edu/multimedia-gallery/nasm2018-00448jpg\">The Barmacide Feast</a></em>, we got to see the poshest Genesis yet, the brand's take on a big luxury electric vehicle inspired by Korean hospitality.</p>\n<h2>The Neolum Concept</h2>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Genesis-at-NYIAS-2024-2-980x735.jpg\" /></div>\n          <p>\n            The Genesis Neolum has the looks to hold its own next to any Range Rover or Bentley Bentayga.

Genesis is owned by Hyundai Group, after all, and has access to the E-GMP architecture, a thoroughly up-to-date flexible platform that keeps impressing us.
