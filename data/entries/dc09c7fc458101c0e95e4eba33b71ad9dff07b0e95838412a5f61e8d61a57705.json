Or it was until a few years ago, when the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/03/the-tesla-model-3-reviewed-finally/\">Tesla Model 3</a> arrived and <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2020/05/08/tesla-model-3-scores-more-than-2x-as-many-sales-as-bmw-3-4-series-in-usa/\">started to eat</a> the 3 Series' <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2021/04/26/tesla-model-3-becomes-best-selling-premium-sedan-in-the-world/\">lunch</a>. But now there is a battery electric vehicle that may turn things around for BMW, in the shape of a five-door fastback sedan called the i4.</p>\n<p>After <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2014/12/bmw-i3-review-a-city-car-for-the-future/\">an early lead</a> and then <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/09/bmw-at-critical-junction-on-electric-car-strategy-reuters-says/\">a bit of a stumble</a>, BMW has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/03/bmws-big-electric-car-push-selling-2-million-new-evs-by-2025/\">recharged its electrification efforts</a>. Last month, we went to Germany and drove the automaker's newest flagship, a technology-laden sporty SUV <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/09/forget-the-looks-love-the-tech-the-83200-bmw-ix-electric-suv/\">called the iX</a>. But the iX isn't the only new BEV that BMW has been working on, and we got to spend a day with the range-topping $65,900 i4 M50 as well. The i4 is the first of BMW's electric cars to be blessed by its legendary M division, and it comes with a pair of electric motors wrapped up in a sleek 4 Series Gran Coupe body. At the risk of spoiling the rest of this review, it's really rather good.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/BMW-i4-2.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/BMW-i4-2-980x653.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/BMW-i4-2.jpg\">The i4 M50 may not be a Nürburgring monster like the M3, but it's a fast and powerful electric sedan that rides well and features some clever technology.</a> (credit: BMW)</p></div>\n<p>Our first clue about the i4 came back in 2017, when BMW showed off <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/09/is-bmws-i-vision-dynamics-concept-its-next-electric-car/\">an electric four-door concept called the i Vision Dynamics</a>. Last year, the company followed up with something much closer to the production car, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/03/who-did-the-future-electric-sedan-best-bmw-or-hyundai/\">the Concept i4</a>. In June, I got face time with—but didn't drive—the entry-level car, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/06/bmw-finds-its-mojo-again-with-the-55400-i4-electric-sedan/\">the $55,400 i4 eDrive40</a>. That version makes do with a single motor driving the rear wheels, giving it 300 miles (483 km) of range.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1803395#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1803395&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
