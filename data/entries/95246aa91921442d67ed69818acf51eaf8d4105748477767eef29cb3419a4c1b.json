I became the first rider to claim three consecutive World Championships, I had the honor of winning Paris-Roubaix. I scored my 100th professional victory while wearing the Bora-Hansgrohe colours, I won my record-breaking seventh green jersey in the Tour de France and my first ever <em>ciclamino</em> jersey in the Giro d’Italia.</p>\n<p>'However, after a long and thorough discussion with my own management and under a mutual agreement with Bora-Hansgrohe, we came to the decision that it would be best if my cycle in the team came to a close and that a new chapter opened in my career. Change is part of life and growth.'</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/8398/cyclist-magazine-podcast-episode-5-how-to-go-everesting-with-phil-gaimon\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast: Episode 5 – How to go Everesting with Phil Gaimon</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/2104/vuelta-a-espana-route-race-reports-tv-guide-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Vuelta a Espana 2021: Route, start list, live TV guide and all we know so far</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/913/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2021: Route, teams and all you need to know</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nAccording to Dutch website <em>Wielerflits, </em>it is French ProTeam TotalEnergies that are in pole position to win the signing of double Monument winner Sagan in what would be a big three-year deal.</p>\n<p>Team manager Jean-René Bernaudeau hinted that an agreement with Sagan was close and that it hinged on American bike manufacturer, Specialized, replacing current bike sponsors Wilier as part of the deal.</p>\n<p>It is thought that Specialized is keen to keep Sagan on its bikes – having begun its partnership in 2015 – and are therefore willing to come on board with the team in order to do so.</p>\n<p>Following Sagan across to Team TotalEnergies would be Sagan's brother Juraj, Daniel Oss, Maciej Bodnar and Erik Baska as well as Sagan's off-bike 'entourage'.</p>\n<p>While Team TotalEnergies rarely struggle with invites to the biggest WorldTour races such as the Tour de France and Paris-Roubaix anyway, the acquisition of Sagan would make their presence at key races a guarantee.</p>\n<p>Also leaving the Bora-Hansgrohe team is German sprinter Pascal Ackermann, who is thought to be joining UAE Team Emirates. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"95246aa91921442d67ed69818acf51eaf8d4105748477767eef29cb3419a4c1b","category":"Cycling"}
