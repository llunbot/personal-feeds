In this section route planning, bike and gear planning, food and water planning, packing your bike, navigating, getting started, and Leave No Trace skills for bikepackers are presented”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em><strong>Going Bikepacking: While Out Riding</strong></em> section breaks down the knowledge and skills we’ve found are imperative to developing bikepacking competency: self-care, finding and managing water, camp skills, risk management, riding solo, and the bikepacker’s mindset”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em><strong>Gone Bikepacking: Field Reports</strong></em>, contributors who inspire us through their perspectives and experiences share their stories to inspire you to consider all the forms and roles bikepacking can take for us. Annijke Wade shares her powerful story of learning to bikepack as a newly adaptive cyclist. Jim Blount shares how bikepacking with his dog, Charlie, in the mountains facilitates his sense of security in his gender identity. Brooke Goudy lets the reader into the joy and sacredness of sharing bikepacking in affinity spaces. Patrick Farnsworth shows the reader how parents can bring their young children to discover the wonder of the world through bikepacking with kids. And Crystal Kovaks connects bikepacking with her family as a means to travel self-supported across the landscape to her mission to empower women to bikepack – regardless of their perceived limitations. Each of these stories enriches this guide. The knowledge and skills to bikepack are imparted in the first two sections of the guide, but these stories from bikepackers from a variety of walks of life are what help you see what is possible, and for who, through bikepacking”.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bikepacking-Guide-Second-Edition-pace-chart.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"990\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bikepacking-Guide-Second-Edition-pace-chart-800x990.jpeg\" alt=\"Bikepacking Guide Second Edition pace chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bikepacking-Guide-Second-Edition-pace-chart-800x990.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bikepacking-Guide-Second-Edition-pace-chart-242x300.jpeg 242w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bikepacking-Guide-Second-Edition-pace-chart-97x120.jpeg 97w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bikepacking-Guide-Second-Edition-pace-chart-768x950.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bikepacking-Guide-Second-Edition-pace-chart.jpeg 1032w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The new Resources section of the guide is meant to be a quick reference of checklists for you as you prepare for your trip. From trip preparation to bike maintenance and common mechanicals, to a resupply and a camp checklist, these resources can be screenshots, torn out of your guide, printed, or jotted down as a tool for you to make sure you cover your bases when preparing for and when out riding”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Get Your Own Bikepackers Guide</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bikepacker’s Guide, Second Edition is now available in a full-color <a href=\"https://bikepackingroots.org/product/the-bikepackers-guide-2nd-edition-paperback-version/?mc_cid=126c0bfc69&amp;mc_eid=fd1418a432\" target=\"_blank\">5″x8.5″ print book</a> as well as a <a href=\"https://bikepackingroots.org/product/bikepackers-guide-digital-download/?mc_cid=126c0bfc69&amp;mc_eid=fd1418a432\" target=\"_blank\">digital version</a>.
