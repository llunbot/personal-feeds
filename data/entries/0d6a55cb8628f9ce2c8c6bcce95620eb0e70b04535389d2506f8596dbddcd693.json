This revelation comes as Apple prepares to launch its first MacBook Pro models with OLED displays, which are likely still a few years away.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-MacBook-Pro-M4-hero.jpg\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" />\r<br />\nIn line with previous reports, TrendForce said Apple plans to begin using OLED displays for MacBooks between 2026 and 2027.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLG and Samsung will likely be Apple's two major suppliers of OLED displays for the MacBook Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCompared to current MacBook Pro models with mini-LED screens, benefits of OLED technology would include increased brightness, higher contrast ratio with deeper blacks, improved power efficiency for longer battery life, and more. The switch to OLED displays could also contribute to future MacBook Pro models having a thinner design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIndeed, thinner MacBook Pro models with OLED displays are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/03/future-macbook-pro-rumors/\">rumored to launch in 2026</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the interim, the MacBook Pro is not expected to receive any major changes. Unsurprisingly, next year's models are expected to get a spec bump to M5, M5 Pro, and M5 Max chips, but no redesign is expected until the switch to OLED displays.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple updated the MacBook Pro line last month with M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/trendforce/\">TrendForce</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/22/apple-preparing-for-oled-macbook-pros/\">Apple Preparing for MacBook Pro Models With OLED Displays</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-for-macbook-pro-models-with-oled-displays.2443726/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0d6a55cb8628f9ce2c8c6bcce95620eb0e70b04535389d2506f8596dbddcd693","category":"Apple"}
