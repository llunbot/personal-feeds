Building on Android enables third parties to make their apps seamlessly available on Karoo and create Extensions that add meaningful value to our mutual riders. We strongly believe in the power of the cycling community, and the Extension Library allows us to solve problems together, whether they are a large brand or a developer who is a passionate cyclist working on a side project. We are excited to continue working with the community to add more third-party apps to the Extension Library in the coming months and years ahead,” </em> said Jess Braun, Hammerhead Category Director</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hammerhead-Native-Extension-Library-karoo.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hammerhead-Native-Extension-Library-karoo.webp\" alt=\"Hammerhead Native Extension Library karoo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hammerhead-Native-Extension-Library-karoo.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hammerhead-Native-Extension-Library-karoo-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hammerhead-Native-Extension-Library-karoo-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hammerhead-Native-Extension-Library-karoo-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hammerhead-Native-Extension-Library-karoo-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hammerhead-Native-Extension-Library-karoo-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps Now Available</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As of March 6th, 2025, the following applications are now available on Hammerhead devices. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.epicrideweather.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Ride Weather</a><br />This app provides weather forecasts that can be personalized by taking into account your speed and location.
