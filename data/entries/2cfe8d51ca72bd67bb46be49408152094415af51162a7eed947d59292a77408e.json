That means they can't distinguish between vehicles of different sizes and only know that something is approaching you, not, for example, how much space it will allow when passing.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009851#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009851&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2cfe8d51ca72bd67bb46be49408152094415af51162a7eed947d59292a77408e","category":"Tech"}
