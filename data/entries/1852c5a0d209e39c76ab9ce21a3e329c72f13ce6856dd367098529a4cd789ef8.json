{"title":"First Look: Shimano’s Lace-Up New Enduro/DH Shoe, the SH-GE700","link":"https://bikerumor.com/shimano-enduro-dh-shoe-sh-ge700/","date":1716382800000,"content":"<p><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-hero.jpeg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" alt=\"(Photos/Ron Frazelle)\" /></p>\n<p>Just recently, I had the opportunity to try one of <a href=\"https://ride.shimano.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano’s</a> newer gravity shoes. The GE900 and GE700 were <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/shimano-gravity-enduro-ge-gf-clipless-flat-mtb-shoes/\" target=\"_blank\">released last Summer</a>. And out of the two new shoes, I chose to try the <a href=\"https://ride.shimano.com/products/sh-ge700\" target=\"_blank\">GE700</a>. For me personally, I like a laced cycling shoe, as I feel that laces have infinite adjustment capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laces are one of the main reasons I chose to try out the GE700 over the GE900. In comparison, the GE900 has both a large velcro strap along the top and the BOA L6 dial for adjustment (which Zach loved enough to give <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bikerumor-editors-choice-2023-zachs-gear-of-the-year/\" target=\"_blank\">an Editor’s Choice award</a>). It also has a neoprene ankle collar to keep dirt shrapnel out of your shoe.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-DE700-logo.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-DE700-logo.jpeg\" alt=\"First Look Shimano GE700 Shoes DE700 logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-DE700-logo.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-DE700-logo-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-DE700-logo-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-DE700-logo-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-DE700-logo-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-DE700-logo-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Ron Frazele)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, The GE700 loses the BOA dial, and the neoprene which seemed perfect for me. So, the GE700 was the way to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>GE700 First Impressions</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-in-the-dirt.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-in-the-dirt.jpeg\" alt=\"First Look Shimano GE700 Shoes in the dirt\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-in-the-dirt.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-in-the-dirt-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-in-the-dirt-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-in-the-dirt-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-in-the-dirt-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-in-the-dirt-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Outta the box, it’s a handsome shoe. The light gray they sent me looked low-key and understated, just like I like it. They didn’t have the flashy, futuristic looks of a typical cycling shoe, or the alternative, out-of-the-ordinary look that I prefer. But, that being said, I really liked the way they looked. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-old-MX70.jpeg\"><img

past few months, I’ve been leaning towards trying shoes with wider toe boxes – the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/stomp-lox-slack-casual-suede-bike-shoe-wide-toe-box/\" target=\"_blank\">Stomp Lox Slack</a> and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-look-vaude-tvl-sykkel-bike-shoes/\" target=\"_blank\">Vaude TVL Sykkel</a> shoes to be more specific. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a

their feature list (below) for the GE700s. And, when reading what some users had to say, a wider toe-box was mentioned more than once. So, I was optimistic that the GE700 would not have a narrow fit like some other Shimano shoes I’ve tried. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-snug-fit.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-snug-fit.jpeg\" alt=\"First Look Shimano GE700 Shoes snug fit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-snug-fit.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-snug-fit-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-snug-fit-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-snug-fit-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-snug-fit-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-snug-fit-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> When I tried them on, they did feel a lot more snug than I had hoped, but the toe box was a bit wider than the other models of Shimano shoes I’ve tried. Off the bike hiking while on a ride is where I tend to feel a toe box that is too narrow for me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, after the initial fit, I laced them up, attached the strap, and walked around the house, keeping them on for five hours or so. They have a stiffness rating of 6, and that seems to track with how they feel while walking around. Plus, the real good news, they worked themselves in and got more comfy in the toe box area. Whew! </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cool GE700 Features </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano says that the GE700 lets you confidently tackle technical terrain. It has a TORBEL 2.0 midsole that will allow the heel section of the shoe to move torsionally. This claims to maintain a full range of motion that, in turn, allows for improved “comfort, fluidity, and on-bike control”. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-Bottoms.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-Bottoms.jpeg\" alt=\"First Look Shimano GE700 Shoes Bottoms\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-Bottoms.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-Bottoms-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-Bottoms-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-Bottoms-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-Bottoms-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-Bottoms-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With Enduro in mind, the ULTREAD GE outsole will deliver superior grip while trudging through slippery hike-a-bike sections. The large molded pedal channel will provide a stable shoe-to-pedal connection, even in unclipped situations where can’t clip back in right away. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-weight.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-weight.jpeg\" alt=\"First Look Shimano GE700 Shoes weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-weight.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-weight-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-weight-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-weight-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-weight-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/First-Look-Shimano-GE700-Shoes-weight-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The GE700 comes in sizes 38/M5-5.5 through 48/M12.5.

I’m excited to give the shoes a good romping this Summer and see how the claimed features hold up.
