You are forced to get creative when parts must be imported, cost an eye-watering amount, or simply don’t exist without an obscure connection to an overseas junkyard. On one particular occasion, I ended up at the local hardware store in search of bar stock to fabricate the rusted-out square nuts that secured the radiator in my 1996 Toyota Prado. Where would I park? Next to this Mitsubishi Delica, of course.</p>\n<p>I suspected its owner would likely be on a similar mission. I carefully left a note asking if I could photograph the Delica and its owner under a wiper blade that is likely only replaceable through a Japanese order and duty tax. It turns out that the Delica’s owner, Flynn, works as a full-time trail digger for the Whatcom Mountain Bike Coalition, our local trail advocacy group. The shoot was on. I now present Flynn, his 1997 Mitsubishi Delica Space Gear, and Raaw Jibb.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-31.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-31.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-31.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-31.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-30.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-30.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-30.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-30.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-29.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-29.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-29.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-29.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Mitsubishi Delica (named by contracting <em>delivery</em> and <em>car</em>) has been in production since 1968 and could be configured as a pickup truck, cargo van, or passenger van. Flynn’s is a 1997 Delica L400, commonly called the Delica Space Gear, and is the fourth generation of the vehicle. Learning the naming conventions of Japanese market cars and how they are named elsewhere in the world is part of the charm. Space for your gear – I see no problem with the name. The Chamonix trim package features accessories suited to a dirt- and snow-focused lifestyle for “Outdoor Players”. Weather-resistant rubber carpeting, fog lights, and a reinforced bumper bar make this a desirable trim for a PNW trail digger. Unfortunately, it was never sold in the United States market.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-4.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-4.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-9.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-9.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Previous to the L400, Flynn owned an L300. The L300 is the boxier and potentially funkier-looking of the previous generation Delica. Flynn bought the L400 on Vancouver Island for a stellar deal. After driving it back to Marin County, where he was living at the time, he’s made multiple trips up and down the West Coast. From snowy excursions back to Vancouver Island to daily trips up our local logging roads, it’s proven a reliable source of memories. Remarkably, it hasn’t even broken down.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-10.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-10.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-13.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-13.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-13.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-13.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-18.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-18.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-18.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-18.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>JDM imports are popular in the Pacific Northwest, given our proximity to Japan and the ports through which these cars come. We have a number of L300 and L400 Delicas putzing around town. They stand over 6 feet tall but don’t have the girth and unruly presence of many American vehicles, so they’re hard to miss. In that regard, they are practical and usable; a stock Delica is actually narrower than a Smart car.</p>\n<p>Flynn put wider wheels and tires on his – a wise upgrade for a tall vehicle that spends time on uneven terrain. It has a road presence that is uncommon, tall but not wide, capable but not flashy. They’re endearing and practical, perhaps what many of us would consider the most lovable aspects of a vehicle. His bike isn’t too different.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-23.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-23.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Raaw Jibb is as functional, utilitarian, and uncommon as his Delica. Given Flynn’s job, the bike has likely had first hits on many of the berms, bumps, humps, jumps, and lumps that everyone in Bellingham now gets to enjoy. Like the Delica, it’s understated yet still very different from the rest of the rides we see around town. It’s clear that it gets used – the send-o-meter o-ring on the fork was at full compression and the cranks are finished in a silver only achievable through innumerable pedal strokes.</p>\n<p>We’ll call them passively polished. John Watson likes to use the Grant Peterson-coined term <em>beausage –</em> beauty through usage – to describe an appearance only achievable through miles and mud. This bike has <em>beausage</em> in spades. Flynn lauds the Jibb’s ability to ride way outside of its numbers. I’d argue that the Delica is the same beast: 4×4 capability in a package that initially appears too tarmac and tame.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-8.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>On the morning before we met up at the Port of Bellingham, I was driving to work and saw a JDM <em>kei</em> van pulling into Trader Joe’s. It turned out that Flynn was in his other vehicle: a 1997 Subaru Sandbar Diaz, another (much smaller) Japanese van. Shortly after passing one another, his brake pad retention spring called it quits, the pad ejected itself onto Yew Street, and Flynn had to engine-brake it into a gravel lot. He got a lift back home and drove the Delica back up to Galbraith Mountain to dig all day. During our shoot, he took a call from the tow truck driver, who was stoked to find out he was going to be towing a goofy little van. We don’t choose these vehicles because they are reliable; we choose them because they are fun and quirky and give us something to tinker with. Second takes at stoplights and smiles on passing children are just some of the reasons we choose these radical rigs. On that note, I’ll leave you with a teaser for one of our future subjects.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-18-at-8.33.00%E2%80%AFAM.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-18-at-8.33.00%E2%80%AFAM.png?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-18-at-8.33.00%E2%80%AFAM.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-18-at-8.33.00%E2%80%AFAM.png?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Oh, car people.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-5.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-5.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-5.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-5.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-15.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-15.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-15.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-15.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-20.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-20.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-20.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-20.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>1997 Mitsubishi Delica Space Gear Chamonix</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2.8 L 4M40 Turbo Diesel Inline-4 Cylinder motor</li>\n<li>3-speed automatic transmission with overdrive</li>\n<li>Rear wheel drive with select four-wheel drive</li>\n<li>Wheelbase: 3,000 mm</li>\n<li>Length: 5,085 mm</li>\n<li>Width: 1,695 mm</li>\n<li>Height: 2,070 mm</li>\n<li>Curb weight 1,690–2,170 kg (3,730–4,780 lb)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-24.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-24.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-24.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-24.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-27.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-27.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-27.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Radical_Rigs_Delica_Raaw_Jiib-27.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Raaw Jibb</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>135 mm travel rear, 150 mm travel fork (Flynn fitted a 160 for our PNW chunder)</li>\n<li>35 mm BB drop</li>\n<li>77.5º effective seat tube angle</li>\n<li>65.5º Head Tube Angle</li>\n<li>Geometry that splits the difference between the trail bike and enduro bike categories</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>What’s next for our Radical Rigs series?
