{"title":"Kara Swisher on Katie Cotton","link":"https://www.vox.com/2014/5/30/11627500/goodbye-to-all-that-today-is-katie-cottons-last-day-at-apple","date":1681177803000,"content":"\n<p>Kara Swisher, back in 2014, on Katie Cotton’s retirement from Apple:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Did she sometimes ice our reporters out, ignore calls or reply\nwith newsless answers? Sometimes. [...] Did she try her hardest\nto showcase Apple and its products in a way that benefited it?\nYep. [...] Was she vocal when she did not like something we did?\nAnd how.</p>\n\n<p><em>So what?</em></p>\n\n<p>That kind of hard driving is part and parcel to the business, even\nif she was harder driving and, because of that, more successful\nthan most. As she once told me when we talked about her outsize\nreputation in the tech press: “I am not here to make friends with\nreporters, I am here to put a light on and sell Apple products.”</p>\n\n<p>It was no surprise that some used the opportunity of her exit to\ndrag out their complaints in the kind of strange rage that has\nbeen — at least to my mind — oddly emotional and sometimes full\nof vitriol that would never be directed at a man who was\nsimilarly strong.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the various words used to describe her: “Queen of Evil,”\n“wicked witch,” “cold and distant,” “frigid supremacy,” “queen\nbee” and, perhaps most obviously misogynistic, “dominatrix.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I always appreciated Cotton’s forthrightness, and part of that is Apple’s institutional default to “no comment” when asked about anything other than what Apple wants to talk about. Those “no comments” seem to downright offend some reporters, but to me, they’re a sign of respect. Better not to say anything at all, and waste no one’s time, than to offer up a lengthy but meaningless pile of bullshit, which in my experience is how most PR teams operate. If you wanted Katie Cotton to coddle you or bullshit you for an hour, you were going to be disappointed. If you wanted Katie Cotton to respect you, you simply needed to respect her and her team at Apple.</p>\n\n<p>As for the misogyny she faced at every step of her career, a lasting part of Cotton’s legacy is that Apple’s PR team remains full of women. I’d wager that Apple PR is majority women, in fact. I could contact Apple to ask about that, but I think I know the answer I’d get.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/10/swisher-on-cotton\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9b0413bb59e6d6eeb689ac3d2abfcf753746287feca445760bc2b0660185ab1c","category":"Tech"}
