But it’s also clear from our slow progress that we could use some help with those emissions. One thing that can help is carbon dioxide removal, as it allows us to reach net-zero emissions even as some difficult-to-solve emissions remain.</p>\n<p>Carbon removal on land—including obvious techniques like reforestation—gets a lot of attention. Carbon removal in the ocean, on the other hand, has seemed a bit pie-in-the-sky, even though the ocean already soaks up more CO<sub>2</sub> than land ecosystems do. A new National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine <a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/a-research-strategy-for-ocean-carbon-dioxide-removal-and-sequestration\">report</a> takes up the challenge of outlining what we would need to learn to make some theoretical techniques for boosting ocean uptake a reality—or to rule them out. The report follows <a href=\"https://www.nap.edu/catalog/18805/climate-intervention-carbon-dioxide-removal-and-reliable-sequestration\">2015</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2018/10/technologies-that-remove-carbon-dioxide-from-air-and-sequester-it-need-to-play-a-large-role-in-mitigating-climate-change-says-new-report\">2019</a> reports that set the state for carbon dioxide removal science more broadly.</p>\n<h2>Boosting productivity</h2>\n<p>The report aims to provide some direction, both for scientists designing studies and for funders (like the National Science Foundation) setting priorities. It’s the work of a sizable group of scientists organized by the National Academies, with funding provided by a sponsorship from the ClimateWorks Foundation.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1820516#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1820516&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scott K.
