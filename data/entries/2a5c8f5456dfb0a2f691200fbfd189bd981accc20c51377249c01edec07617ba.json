He recently created detailed concept renders of what he expects Apple's mixed-reality headset will look like with YouTuber David Lewis based on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/\">rumors</a>, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent/\">patent filings</a>, and his own expertise.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube</a> channel for more videos</em></div>\r<br />\nWe talk through Marcus's approach to the design and what existing Apple products inspired him, looking at some of the key aspects that Apple will have had to consider with the device. We also discuss the broader user experience with the headset, including its rumored <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/03/report-reveals-wave-of-features-for-apple-headset/\">waist-mounted battery pack</a> – which Marcus has envisioned as enclosed in a pouch on a shoulder-strap that also contains a cable to power the device, potential restriction to indoors use only, and real-world passthrough with a \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/26/apple-employees-concerned-about-headset/\">reality dial</a>.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/AXR-Marcus-Kane-Feature-2.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nSince Marcus uses existing headset products to support his design work, we learn about some of practical use-cases for this category of device, where Apple could compete, and what key software features the company could deliver.
