Details are thin on the ground, but it certainly looks to be a cnc-machined piece, boasting a relatively large bearing for the lever to pivot about. We’d hope for this to be launched with a full range of anodized colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hopetech-dropper-remote-sea-otter-classic-2023.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hopetech-dropper-remote-sea-otter-classic-2023-800x601.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hopetech-dropper-remote-sea-otter-classic-2023-800x601.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hopetech-dropper-remote-sea-otter-classic-2023-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hopetech-dropper-remote-sea-otter-classic-2023-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hopetech-dropper-remote-sea-otter-classic-2023-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hopetech-dropper-remote-sea-otter-classic-2023-1536x1153.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hopetech-dropper-remote-sea-otter-classic-2023.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>More official are Hope’s new Floating Rotors, now available in the Centerlock variation. Available in 140mm, 160mm, 180mm , 200mm, 203mm and 220mm diameters, all of Hope’s floating rotors are 1.8mm thick. Additional stiffness and heat dissipation properties afforded by the aluminum carrier negate the need for a thicker braking surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hope-pro5-centerlock-hubs-centerlock-disc-rotors-140-160-180-200-220.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hope-pro5-centerlock-hubs-centerlock-disc-rotors-140-160-180-200-220-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"hope floating rotors centerlock 140mm-1220mm\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hope-pro5-centerlock-hubs-centerlock-disc-rotors-140-160-180-200-220-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hope-pro5-centerlock-hubs-centerlock-disc-rotors-140-160-180-200-220-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hope-pro5-centerlock-hubs-centerlock-disc-rotors-140-160-180-200-220-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hope-pro5-centerlock-hubs-centerlock-disc-rotors-140-160-180-200-220-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hope-pro5-centerlock-hubs-centerlock-disc-rotors-140-160-180-200-220-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hope-pro5-centerlock-hubs-centerlock-disc-rotors-140-160-180-200-220-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hope-pro5-centerlock-hubs-centerlock-disc-rotors-140-160-180-200-220.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>The braking surface is a 410 stainless steel. A meandering external shape is said to help clear mud and maintain brake performance in poor conditions; it also adds extra surface area, which is helpful in dissipating heat.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bearing that in mind, Hope has now upgraded all of its fixed rotors to 2.3mm. These rotors that lack the aluminum carrier rely on the thickness of the braking surface for stiffness, strength, vibration damping and thermal stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hope-200mm-fixed-disc-rotor-extra-thick-6-bolt.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hope-200mm-fixed-disc-rotor-extra-thick-6-bolt-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"hope fixed rotor mtb 200mm 2.3mm thick 6-bolt\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hope-200mm-fixed-disc-rotor-extra-thick-6-bolt-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hope-200mm-fixed-disc-rotor-extra-thick-6-bolt-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hope-200mm-fixed-disc-rotor-extra-thick-6-bolt-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hope-200mm-fixed-disc-rotor-extra-thick-6-bolt-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hope-200mm-fixed-disc-rotor-extra-thick-6-bolt-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hope-200mm-fixed-disc-rotor-extra-thick-6-bolt-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hope-200mm-fixed-disc-rotor-extra-thick-6-bolt.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All of Hope’s brake rotors are laser cut for the high accuracy permitted by the technique, and the low distortion it induces. It is also said to help prevent oxidation of the surfaces. The rotors are then heat treated to increase their lifespan, and to maintain their performance with all brake pad materials. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hope-ebike-speed-sensor-magnet-6-bolt-rotor-mount.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hope-ebike-speed-sensor-magnet-6-bolt-rotor-mount-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"hope ebike magnet speed sensor bolted ont disc rotor 6-bolt\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hope-ebike-speed-sensor-magnet-6-bolt-rotor-mount-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hope-ebike-speed-sensor-magnet-6-bolt-rotor-mount-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hope-ebike-speed-sensor-magnet-6-bolt-rotor-mount-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hope-ebike-speed-sensor-magnet-6-bolt-rotor-mount-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hope-ebike-speed-sensor-magnet-6-bolt-rotor-mount-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hope-ebike-speed-sensor-magnet-6-bolt-rotor-mount-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hope-ebike-speed-sensor-magnet-6-bolt-rotor-mount.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also new and noteworthy is the upcoming addition of a Hope eBike magnet, designed for use with eBike speed sensors. It bolts directly onto the hub’s disc mount, and is compatible with any 6-bolt rotor; a Centerlock option is on its way, too. Hope plan to offer a few different options to suit different eBikes. This one is due to be available by summer, and will be available in all 6 anodized colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.hopetech.com/\" target=\"_blank\">hopetech.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>SQ Lab 50X Flat Pedals</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlab-50x-composite-flat-pedals-three-axle-lengths.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlab-50x-composite-flat-pedals-three-axle-lengths-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"sqlab 50x flat pedal composite platform axle length options\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlab-50x-composite-flat-pedals-three-axle-lengths-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlab-50x-composite-flat-pedals-three-axle-lengths-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlab-50x-composite-flat-pedals-three-axle-lengths-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlab-50x-composite-flat-pedals-three-axle-lengths-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlab-50x-composite-flat-pedals-three-axle-lengths-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlab-50x-composite-flat-pedals-three-axle-lengths-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlab-50x-composite-flat-pedals-three-axle-lengths.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Credit: Rupert Fowler – Bike Connection Agency</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>SQ Lab’s latest flat pedals are available in three axle lengths, in a bid to help riders of all shapes and sizes achieve proper alignment between the knee and foot position on the pedal. The ergonomics specialists offer the 50X Composite Pedal in axle length offsets of -5mm (Size S), 0mm (Size M), and +5mm (Size L). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more widely spaced pedals could be a good option for riders who often find themselves catching their heels on their chainstays. SQ Lab says, <em>“The three different axle lengths provide a physiologically natural foot position on the pedal: Suitable for larger feet, a V-shaped foot position or larger sit bone distances, which usually require a higher Q-factor”</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlabs-50x-flat-pedals-three-axle-lengths-110-x-105mm-platform.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlabs-50x-flat-pedals-three-axle-lengths-110-x-105mm-platform-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"sqlab 50x flat pedal composite platform three axle lengths\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlabs-50x-flat-pedals-three-axle-lengths-110-x-105mm-platform-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlabs-50x-flat-pedals-three-axle-lengths-110-x-105mm-platform-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlabs-50x-flat-pedals-three-axle-lengths-110-x-105mm-platform-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlabs-50x-flat-pedals-three-axle-lengths-110-x-105mm-platform-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlabs-50x-flat-pedals-three-axle-lengths-110-x-105mm-platform-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlabs-50x-flat-pedals-three-axle-lengths-110-x-105mm-platform-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlabs-50x-flat-pedals-three-axle-lengths-110-x-105mm-platform.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Credit: Rupert Fowler – Bike Connection Agency</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlab-50x-pedal-flat-composite-different-axle-lengths-ergonomic-fit.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlab-50x-pedal-flat-composite-different-axle-lengths-ergonomic-fit-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"sqlab 50x flat pedal profile concavity 11 pins per side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlab-50x-pedal-flat-composite-different-axle-lengths-ergonomic-fit-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlab-50x-pedal-flat-composite-different-axle-lengths-ergonomic-fit-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlab-50x-pedal-flat-composite-different-axle-lengths-ergonomic-fit-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlab-50x-pedal-flat-composite-different-axle-lengths-ergonomic-fit-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlab-50x-pedal-flat-composite-different-axle-lengths-ergonomic-fit-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlab-50x-pedal-flat-composite-different-axle-lengths-ergonomic-fit-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sqlab-50x-pedal-flat-composite-different-axle-lengths-ergonomic-fit.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Credit: Rupert Fowler – Bike Connection Agency</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The SQ Lab 50X pedal has a 110mm x 105mm platform made from plastic, reinforced with 30% fiberglass.

The new lever is presented as an upgrade to the stock levers on the aforementioned brakes, offering tool-free reach adjustment as well as adjustment of “lever feel”, which we presume to mean lever throw. The lever also sees the additions of small perforations in a bid to aid grip, especially in wet conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keen on the use of acronyms, Formula has named the new component the “TFRA/FCS Brake Lever Kit”.

Those rotors are the RT-CL900 and RT-CL800. The news here is that both of these rotors are now available in MTB appropriate diameters; 180mm and 203mm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new rotor design claims to use a “more robust alloy carrier and optimized arm shape that reduces heat deformation of the rotor during hard braking”.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/shimano-mtb-rotors-incetech-freeza-180mm-203mm.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"418\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/shimano-mtb-rotors-incetech-freeza-180mm-203mm-800x418.jpg\" alt=\"shimano rt-cl900 rt-cl800 disc rotors mtb 203mm 180mm icetech freeza\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/shimano-mtb-rotors-incetech-freeza-180mm-203mm-800x418.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/shimano-mtb-rotors-incetech-freeza-180mm-203mm-297x155.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/shimano-mtb-rotors-incetech-freeza-180mm-203mm-120x63.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/shimano-mtb-rotors-incetech-freeza-180mm-203mm-768x401.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/shimano-mtb-rotors-incetech-freeza-180mm-203mm-1536x803.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/shimano-mtb-rotors-incetech-freeza-180mm-203mm.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both rotors get Shimano’s proprietary IceTech FREEZA technology, wherein an aluminum core that extends inward, beyond the braking surface, is sandwiched by the stainless steel braking surfaces. This cooling technology is said to result in overall heat reduction of up to 140ºC and a 10% increase in brake pad life. The main difference between the two is the addition of a black heat dissipation paint on the cooling fins of the RT-CL900.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://bike.shimano.com/\" target=\"_blank\">shimano.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reev Components 3D Printed Bash Guard</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/reev-components-3d-printed-bash-guard-mud-rockr.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/reev-components-3d-printed-bash-guard-mud-rockr-800x534.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/reev-components-3d-printed-bash-guard-mud-rockr-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/reev-components-3d-printed-bash-guard-mud-rockr-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/reev-components-3d-printed-bash-guard-mud-rockr-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/reev-components-3d-printed-bash-guard-mud-rockr-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/reev-components-3d-printed-bash-guard-mud-rockr-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/reev-components-3d-printed-bash-guard-mud-rockr-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/reev-components-3d-printed-bash-guard-mud-rockr.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Made entirely in the US is this unusual looking bash guard from Reev Components.
