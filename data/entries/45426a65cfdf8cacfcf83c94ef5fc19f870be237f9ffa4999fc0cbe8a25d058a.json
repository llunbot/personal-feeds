{"title":"Find Any File 2.5","link":"https://findanyfile.app/","date":1723151475000,"content":"\n<p>Developer Thomas Tempelmann just released version 2.5 of Find Any File, his file search utility for the Mac. Find Any File (FAF) has long been my go-to tool for file search. Why use FAF instead of Spotlight? Some feature highlights:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n<li>FAF can <em>find files that Spotlight doesn’t</em>, e.g. on network\n(NAS) and other external volumes, hidden ones inside bundles and\npackages, and those in folders that are usually excluded from\nSpotlight search, such as the System and Library folders. It can\neven search in other user’s folders if you use FAF’s unique\n<a href=\"https://findanyfile.app/support.html#asroot\">root search mode</a>.</li>\n<li>FAF lets you <em>search precisely</em> for many file properties such\nas name, extension, date range, size, kind etc. [...]</li>\n<li>FAF can also find textual content in plain text, in zip\n(including Word and Excel files) and even in most binary files.\nAnd with the option to include Spotlight results, it can also\nfind text in PDF documents as long as they were indexed by\nSpotlight.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Amongst other features, FAF supports regular expressions, and you can save frequently-used searches to easily re-run them. There are several other good file search utilities for MacOS — and Tempelmann himself <a href=\"https://findanyfile.app/index.html#alternatives\">kindly offers a list of them</a> — but FAF is my favorite. Free to download and try, and $6 shareware if you keep it. (Or buy it for $8 <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/find-any-file-faf/id402569179?mt=12\">from the Mac App Store</a>.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/08/find-any-file\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"45426a65cfdf8cacfcf83c94ef5fc19f870be237f9ffa4999fc0cbe8a25d058a","category":"Tech"}
