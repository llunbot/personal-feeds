The app allows users to\nemulate old versions of Windows OS, macOS, Linux, and more to fire\nup classic software and games on Apple devices. [...]</p>\n\n<p>After Apple’s rejection, UTM’s developer said they would not keep\ngoing back and forth because the app would become “a subpar\nexperience.” However, after help from the AltStore team and\n<a href=\"https://x.com/UTMapp/status/1812241740172263663\">another developer</a> to work on some changes, UTM SE was\nfinally approved by Apple on Saturday.</p>\n\n<p>As with other emulators, UTM SE requires that users supply the\noperating systems they want to emulate, but the <a href=\"https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/\">UTM site includes\nguides</a> for Windows XP through Windows 11 emulation, as well\nas downloads of pre-built virtual Linux machines.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not sure what changed <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/18/utm-notarization\">since last month</a>, when Apple not only rejected UTM SE from the App Store but also from notarization for distribution on third-party marketplaces in the EU (and, perhaps soon, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/15/japan-app-stores\">Japan</a>).</p>\n\n<p>In other emulation-on-iOS news, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/10/24195591/delta-ios-update-retro-gaming-emulator-ipad-support-logo\">Delta 1.6 now fully supports iPadOS</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/15/app-store-utm-se\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3b584a457824686331c4826300ad9cc5d1c64dd8564f47f59875b475a93ed08f","category":"Tech"}
