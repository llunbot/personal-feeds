Bromwich and Ben Protess, reporting for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/02/16/nyregion/trump-fraud-engoron-decision.html\">The decision by Justice Arthur F. Engoron</a> caps a chaotic, \nyearslong case in which New York’s attorney general put Mr. \nTrump’s fantastical claims of wealth on trial. With no jury, the \npower was in Justice Engoron’s hands alone, and he came down hard: \nThe judge delivered a sweeping array of punishments that threatens \nthe former president’s business empire as he simultaneously \ncontends with four criminal prosecutions and seeks to regain the \nWhite House. </p>\n\n<p>Not only did Justice Engoron impose a three-year ban preventing \nMr. Trump from serving in top roles at any New York company, \nincluding his own, but the judge also applied that punishment to \nthe former president’s adult sons for two years and ordered that \nthey pay more than $4 million each. One of the sons, Eric Trump, \nis the Trump Organization’s de facto chief executive, and the \nruling throws into doubt whether any member of the family can run \nthe business in the near term. </p>\n\n<p>In his unconventional style, Justice Engoron criticized Mr. Trump \nand the other defendants for refusing to admit errors for years. \n“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on \npathological,” he said. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Trump’s social media feed today is chock full of dozens of (totally sane, rational, well-reasoned) comments on this court decision, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/16/navalny-death-trump-putin-00141899\">without a single word</a> regarding Russian political prisoner and Putin critic/rival Alexei Navalny’s death in a Siberian prison. But he did make time to mention that <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/111942940611817886\">he’ll be at Sneakercon here in Philly tomorrow</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/16/trump-355-mil\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7997c7de4c3e58c3e1bc2b36110fb29150460cbd8ee0723cd2550191741b8e1a","category":"Tech"}
