Inspired by the road-going <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/cannondale-supersix-evo-2020/\">SuperSix EVO</a>, the SuperSix EVO CX has aero-optimised tube shapes, racy geometry and big tyre clearances.</p>\n<p>Beyond paint jobs and pricing then, the differences between the two bikes are down to component specification, with each bike optimised for its respective discipline.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Cannondale SuperSix EVO SE is inspired by the road-going SuperSix EVO.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Cannondale</i></span></div>\n<h2>Cannondale SuperSix EVO CX frameset details</h2>\n<p>The Cannondale SuperSix EVO CX frameset is a brand-new, aero-optimised, carbon cyclocross and gravel frameset from the American brand.</p>\n<p>Compared to its more avant-garde gravel siblings, like the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/2021-cannondale-topstone-carbon-lefty-1-review/\">Topstone Carbon Lefty</a>, the SuperSix EVO CX frameset is a much simpler affair. There’s no single-bladed suspension fork or seatstay pivot here.</p>\n<p>As the SuperSix name suggests, it borrows much more from the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/2021-cannondale-supersix-evo-carbon-disc-ultegra-review/\">SuperSix EVO Carbon Disc</a> – Cannondale’s all-round road racing bike. This looks to be more of a road racer with beefed-up tyre clearances than a mountain bike with drop handlebars.</p>\n<p>This isn’t a bike explicitly for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/tags/bikepacking/\">bikepacking</a>, either, because there are no mounting points for panniers or mudguards. That said, it’s entirely possible to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/jack-luke-scottish-bikepacking-adventure/\">press a cyclocross bike into bikepacking service</a> with some creative luggage choices.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Cannondale SuperSix EVO SE looks more like a road bike with big tyre clearances than a mountain bike with drop handlebars.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Cannondale</i></span></div>\n<p>In terms of geometry, the seatstays on the SuperSix EVO CX are kept relatively short at 42.2cm on all sizes, and the seat tube angles sit around the 73 degrees mark. So far, so racy.</p>\n<p>Cannondale has tweaked things to make the SuperSix EVO CX frameset more off-road friendly, though, particularly at the front end.</p>\n<p>The head-tube angle, for example, sits at a more relaxed 71 degrees and trail (the horizontal distance between the front tyre’s contact patch and where the steering axis meets the ground) is up to 6.2cm on all but the smallest frame size (which gets a 70-degree head-tube angle and 6.9cm of trail).</p>\n<p>Both of these things should lead to a slower, calmer steering response compared to the road-going SuperSix EVO.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-bike-geometry-and-handling/\">The ultimate guide to bike geometry and handling</a></li>\n</ul><p>There are five
