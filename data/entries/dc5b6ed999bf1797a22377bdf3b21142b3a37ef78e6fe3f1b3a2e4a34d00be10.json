Recently, Chrome users have seen warnings pop up that \"This extension may soon no longer be supported,\" with links asking the user to \"Remove or replace it with similar extensions\" from Chrome's Web Store. You might see a similar warning on some extensions if you head to Chrome's Extensions page (chrome://extensions).</p>\n<p>What's happening is Chrome preparing to make Manifest V3 required for extensions that want to run on its platform. <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2018/10/trustworthy-chrome-extensions-by-default.html\">First announced in 2018</a>, the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-starts-deprecating-older-more-capable-chrome-extensions-next-week/\">last word</a> on Manifest V3 was that V2 extensions would start being nudged out in early June on the Beta, Dev, and Canary update channels. Users will be able to manually re-enable V2 extensions \"for a short time,\" <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/mv2-deprecation-timeline\">Google has said</a>, \"but over time, this toggle will go away as well.\" The shift for enterprise Chrome deployments is expected to be put off until June 2025.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041032#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041032&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"dc5b6ed999bf1797a22377bdf3b21142b3a37ef78e6fe3f1b3a2e4a34d00be10","category":"Tech"}
