But they take a bit of effort to install, aren’t easily removed when you don’t want them there, and not every car can handle the weight up top.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-3.jpg\"><img width=\"2141\" height=\"1153\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-3.jpg\" alt=\"thule outset hitch mounted tent shown being installed\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-3.jpg 2141w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-3-297x160.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-3-800x431.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-3-120x65.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-3-768x414.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-3-1536x827.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-3-2048x1103.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Thule Outset solves a lot of those problems by attaching to your car’s hitch, folding up very compactly, and rolling to and from your car easily. Once at your destination, unhitch it and unfold it for a detached camp that leaves you (and your car free) to roam.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-1.jpg\"><img width=\"1584\" height=\"792\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-1.jpg\" alt=\"thule outset hitch mounted rooftop tent for car camping\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-1.jpg 1584w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-1-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-1-800x400.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-1-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-1-1536x768.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Outset has its own elevated platform, with four independently adjustable legs so you can level it. Unlike a ground tent, you won’t need to find a flat or smooth spot for comfortable sleeping. And unlike a rooftop tent, you won’t need to carry a ladder or pack it up every time you want to roam.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-4.jpg\"><img width=\"2162\" height=\"1166\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-4.jpg\" alt=\"thule outset hitch mounted tent shown on back of car driving\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-4.jpg 2162w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-4-297x160.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-4-800x431.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-4-120x65.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-4-768x414.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-4-1536x828.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-4-2048x1105.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Specs are thin, but Thule reps shared that it’s going to weigh in around 160lbs. The first batch is being made for Europe’s ball hitches with a clamp-on attachment, so any 2″ hitch should have no problem carrying it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Thule Outset hitch tent will hit European markets first, shipping in mid-2024. North America will have to wait until 2025 as we use a different hitch system here, and that’s in development. But that’s fine, because you’ll need time to save up. Estimated MRSP is north of $4k.
