And he did this all while competing with haemophilia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now retired, Alex has just released his autobiography, <em>Bloody Minded </em>(Bloomsbury), a candid account that pulls no punches, either when assessing his own performance or telling it like it was, from crap components to dodgy team owners, to going it alone for the Hour. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happily, he’s up for discussing it all, and more, on this week’s show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interview starts at 4:20.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Alex founded his charity, </em><a href=\"https://www.littlebleeders.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Little Bleeders</em></a><em>, in 2016, which supports young people with blood disorders to get into sport. It’s a great cause, so please do pay the website a visit for more details.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloody Minded<em> is published by Bloomsbury and available at all good bookshops.</em> Buy it now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waterstones.com%2Fbook%2Fbloody-minded%2Falex-dowsett%2F9781399406406\" target=\"_blank\">Waterstones (£20)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes/91-alex-dowsett-tells-all-about-pro-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 91 now on Acast</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out </strong><a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>all episodes</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know Cyclist is also stunning monthly magazine?
