Full-size sensor, interchangeable lens system, but it’s the camera design that jumps out:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Sigma BF represents a new, more intuitive way to use a camera.\nIt is streamlined to make the act of photography as effortless as\npossible. We have replaced the shooting mode dial — itself a\nholdover from the days of film photography — with direct access\nto the five elements that decide the photograph. Shutter speed,\naperture, ISO, EV compensation and color mode are all immediately\navailable at the touch of a finger. The new Status Monitor\ndisplays the currently active setting, so the screen provides an\nunobstructed view of the subject.</p>\n\n<p>The BF’s high-resolution screen provides a distraction-free view\nof all necessary information — and nothing more. With one simple\nsetting, it shows only the live view image, with the five key\nelements — shutter speed, aperture, ISO, EV compensation and\ncolor mode — displayed when you are ready to press the shutter\nbutton. All other options and settings are accessed via just three\nsimple menu screens.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This camera immediately struck lust in my heart. So many fewer dials and buttons, it’s striking. They even got rid of storage cards — 230 GB of internal storage instead. $2000 (sans any lenses).</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/sigma-bf\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5b85dd7c0b66fd18ce0b8a951362f50ce36f2bf295593cfaec2c67115c6f5306","category":"Tech"}
