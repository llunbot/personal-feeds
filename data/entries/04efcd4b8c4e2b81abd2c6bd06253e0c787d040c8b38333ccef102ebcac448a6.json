If you think your readers would be interested, I’d be grateful if you’d share this opportunity with them. The auction will end at 5:45 am MST on Wednesday, Dec. 15, and no, he won’t be auctioning off his bibs as well!</p>\n<p>Bid at <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/353802650070\" target=\"_blank\">eBay</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2021/12/lachlan-morton-is-auctioning-off-his-alt-tour-jersey/\">Lachlan Morton is Auctioning Off His Alt-Tour Jersey</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"04efcd4b8c4e2b81abd2c6bd06253e0c787d040c8b38333ccef102ebcac448a6","category":"Cycling"}
