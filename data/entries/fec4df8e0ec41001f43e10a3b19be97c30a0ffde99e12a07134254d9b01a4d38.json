Survey respondents were asked how many days in the past 30 days they used cannabis, which allowed researchers to estimate the odds of cardiovascular disease along the whole spectrum of cannabis use. And they found near-linear dose-responses, with more days of use per month associated with higher risk.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007181#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007181&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fec4df8e0ec41001f43e10a3b19be97c30a0ffde99e12a07134254d9b01a4d38","category":"Tech"}
