Cook was originally granted the stock as part of performance-based award based on Apple's shareholder return relative to other S&amp;P 500 companies, and he often sells stock in October.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/Apple-Logo-Cash-Feature-Mint.jpg\" width=\"2676\" height=\"1504\" />\r<br />\nEarlier this week, Cook was granted an additional 219,502 shares of Apple stock. 54,876 shares are set to vest in one-third increments in April of 2027, 2028, and 2029. 164,626 shares are performance-based and will vest on October 1, 2027. Depending on Apple's performance between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2027, between 0 and 200 percent of the target number of shares can vest.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe total bonus will depend on Apple's total shareholder return relative to other companies in the S&amp;P 500 over the next two years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs of early 2024, Cook owned over <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/11/tim-cook-compensation-2023/\">three million shares</a> of Apple stock, along with an additional 1.3 million unvested RSUs. Cook's unsold stock is worth over $500 million, and stock grants make up the majority of his total compensation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2023, Cook's base salary was $3 million, but he also received $47 million in stock awards, $10.7 million in performance-based bonus awards, and $2.5 million in other compensation, such as 401(k) contributions, term life insurance premiums, vacation cash-out, security expenses, and personal air travel expenses.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/02/tim-cook-sells-50-million-in-apple-stock/\">Apple CEO Tim Cook Sells Over $50 Million Worth of Stock</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-sells-over-50-million-worth-of-stock.2438947/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b9bb9368a325dd798bc411bc7f52b5682a743d94c387073518fb0de9d9a41583","category":"Apple"}
