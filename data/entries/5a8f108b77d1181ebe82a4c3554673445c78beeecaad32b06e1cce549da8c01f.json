This information and other insights are based on sources that have seen early versions of iOS 18, the next version of the iPhone operating system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has given iOS 18 the codename Crystal, and it contains references to iPhone models D47, D48, D93, and D94, which could be the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max, respectively. iOS 18 also indicates that these phones will use a chip identified as t8140 (code-named Tahiti), which is the A18. It is not clear if the iPhone 16 Pro models will have chips branded as A18 Pro, and the non-Pro phones’ chip branded as A18, but it has been <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2083959/iphone-16-a18-processor-branding.html\">rumored</a> that Apple will use this nomenclature. Specifications for the A18 were not cited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported in February that <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-02-05/is-an-iphone-ultra-or-iphone-fold-coming-from-apple-ceo-remarks-offer-clues-ldrhx53a&amp;xcust=1-1-2178651-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple could be developing an iPhone 16 Ultra</a>, which would presumably have “further camera improvements, a faster chip, and perhaps an even larger display” than the Pro Max model. However, it does not appear that iOS 18 has any references to an iPhone 16 Ultra, nor is it clear if iOS 18’s D94 reference is actually an Ultra model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MacRumors also points out that iOS 18 refers to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules made by Broadcom. Bloomberg’s Gurman reported that <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-09/apple-plans-to-drop-broadcom-chip-by-2025-to-use-in-house-design&amp;xcust=1-1-2178651-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple is developing its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules</a>, but the parts are projected for a 2025 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several reports have stated that Apple is working on its own 5G modem that would replace the Qualcomm part that is currently used, but the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157698/apple-5g-modem-scrapped-rumor.html\">project has met several delays</a> that prevent it from being used in the iPhone 16.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more reports about the iPhone 16, check out our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16 rumor roundup</a>.</p>\n\niOS, iPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5a8f108b77d1181ebe82a4c3554673445c78beeecaad32b06e1cce549da8c01f","category":"Apple"}
