It should just cover the clamp without extending onto the body of the lever. Carefully measure and cut down to length.</p>\n<p>Keep the shortened strips within arm’s reach for when you need them mid-wrap – we like to stick them loosely on the frame’s top tube.</p>\n<h3>3. On with the new</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Mechanic wrapping bar tape\" title=\"Mechanic wrapping bar tape\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Start wrapping the bars from the bottom, keeping even tension on the tape.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Before you start wrapping the new tape, there are a couple of points to note.</p>\n<p>Firstly, we’d recommend wrapping from the drops of the bar to the hoods. If you wrap the bar the other way round, it won’t be as durable because you’ll be effectively loosening it with your palms as you ride.</p>\n<p>Next, if you are wrapping the driveside of the bar, the tape should be wrapped in a clockwise orientation. The non-driveside should be wrapped anti-clockwise. It should be wrapped in this direction because, when you are riding on the drops, you will be naturally tightening the tape.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bar tape wrapping direction annotation\" title=\"Bar tape wrapping direction annotation\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> An easy way to remember…</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Starting at the bottom of the drops, keeping firm tension on the tape, wrap moving out from the bar. If the bar-end plug supplied simply pushes in, we’d recommend stuffing a small portion of tape inside the bottom of the bar and then beginning your main wrap to help keep it locked in place.</p>\n<p>Make sure the gaps are even as you wrap – if the other side is already wrapped, keep referring to it to make sure they match. Most tape has chamfered edges, which allow a given level of overlap without adding thickness, but at the sharpest curves you’ll have to vary the overlap, making the wrap thicker.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Park Tool SPA-2 Pin Spanner securing bar tape\" title=\"Park Tool SPA-2 Pin Spanner securing bar tape\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A pin spanner is the perfect tool to keep tape secure.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Once you’ve wrapped three or four rotations, secure the tape and install the bar-end plug. We like to use a pin spanner, but you can also use a plier or a toe strap.</p>\n<p>It’s best to install the bar-end plug now rather than at the very end to make sure it installs neatly – there’s nothing worse than having to unravel already wrapped tape to install a stubborn bar plug.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bar end plug on handlebar tape\" title=\"Bar end plug on handlebar tape\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Make sure any logos on the plug are in the correct orientation for pro mechanic points.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Once the bar plug is installed, continue wrapping the tape until you arrive at the shifter.</p>\n<h3>4.

Others prefer to wrap the tape around the shifter in a figure-of-eight to ensure full coverage, but this can translate into excess bulk.</p>\n<p>We like to wrap the tape so its covers the underside of the shifter before swinging around the inside curve of the bar and up and over the top face of the lever hood.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Figure-of-eight bar tape around the shifter\" title=\"Figure-of-eight bar tape around the shifter\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Check and double-check before continuing the wrap.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Continue to wrap the tape towards the tops.</p>\n<h3>5.
