He dropped the training edit to prove it yesterday, and the clip is equal parts stoke vid, personal reflection, and roller grill items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, maybe not <em>quite</em> equal. The way Swenson rides, you figure he could really locker away some jalapeño cheddar sausages, ranchero steak &amp; cheese taquitos, and more — but as anyone who’s cranked highway miles in the U.S. knows, there’s a bowel threshold that must be obeyed if productivity, or even basic comfort, is to be preserved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, at some point, it seems, we all must come to our own hot dog and/or <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=363648094519626\" target=\"_blank\">cheeseburger reckoning</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But enough with the American traditional meat sandwich items.
