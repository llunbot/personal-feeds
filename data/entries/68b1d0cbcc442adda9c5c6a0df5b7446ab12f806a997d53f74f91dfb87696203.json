First, a few dozen visitors. Then, a few hundred. And today, thousands. What the heck?</p>\n<p>The article itself is <em>extremely</em> lackluster. It was an excuse to run a photo gallery depicting a Falcon 9 launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base, as it was then known, in May 2018. This Iridium NEXT-6 mission launched five communications satellites for the private company Iridium and a small NASA satellite. About the only thing notable about this mission is that the first-stage booster was reused from the mysteriously lost <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/01/spacex-gets-good-news-from-the-air-force-on-the-zuma-mission/\">Zuma launch</a> a few months earlier. Anyway, the California liftoff looked super cool because it was a rare launch from Vandenberg amid clear skies.</p>\n<p>All told, the article was maybe 100 words and a dozen photos. However, one of them, the second photo in the gallery, was a long-exposure \"streak shot\" that showed the pillar of flame beneath the rocket's ascent. That photo appears at the top of this article. It's a beautiful picture. In casual conversation a few months later, the SpaceX photographer who took the shot thanked me for sharing it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961055#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961055&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"68b1d0cbcc442adda9c5c6a0df5b7446ab12f806a997d53f74f91dfb87696203","category":"Tech"}
