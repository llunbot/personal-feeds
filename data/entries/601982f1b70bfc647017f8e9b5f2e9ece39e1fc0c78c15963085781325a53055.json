LAist ran a story on him today and it’s worth the read!</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Two months and six days after the Eaton Fire broke out, on the very same day the Army Corps of Engineers came with bulldozers to clear the rubble of his burned down home, Matt Baffert finally got back out on the mountain trails.</p>\n<p>“Idlehour Trail…in the upper Eaton Canyon,” he said. “For lack of a better word, my second home.”</p>\n<p>Baffert works as a construction contractor by day. In his free time, he’s an avid mountain biker and trail steward, repairing trails after wildfires, floods and other mayhem in the Angeles National Forest. In 2019, he co-founded the <a href=\"https://lowelifesrcc.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Lowelifes Respectable Citizens’ Club</u></a>, a dedicated nonprofit group of volunteer trail builders and menders.”</p></blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Read the story at <a href=\"https://laist.com/news/climate-environment/eaton-fire-lowelifes-altadena-wildfires-trail-rebuilding\" target=\"_blank\">LAist</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/matt-baffert-lowelifes-eaton-fire-laist/\">LAist Article on Matt Baffert from Lowelifes and the Eaton Fire</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"601982f1b70bfc647017f8e9b5f2e9ece39e1fc0c78c15963085781325a53055","category":"Cycling"}
