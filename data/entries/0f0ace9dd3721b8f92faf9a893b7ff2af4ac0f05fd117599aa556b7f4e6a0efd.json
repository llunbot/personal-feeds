And, they say they’re just as grippy AND durable, but now a lot faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 160g savings claim is for the 29er, but both models are available in 27.5″ and 29″ sizes with 2.4″ widths. The DH16 comes in at 1270g (27.5″) and 1350g (29″). The DH22 tires are 10g lighter per size.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-michelin-DH16-DH22-downhill-mountain-bike-tires-03.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-michelin-DH16-DH22-downhill-mountain-bike-tires-03-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"tread block patterns closeup on 2024 michelin DH16 and DH22 downhill mountain bike tires\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-michelin-DH16-DH22-downhill-mountain-bike-tires-03-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-michelin-DH16-DH22-downhill-mountain-bike-tires-03-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-michelin-DH16-DH22-downhill-mountain-bike-tires-03-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-michelin-DH16-DH22-downhill-mountain-bike-tires-03-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-michelin-DH16-DH22-downhill-mountain-bike-tires-03.jpg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>The DH22 on the left, DH16 on the right.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both tires’ tread patterns stay the same, but they roll 19% faster thanks to the new casing and updated Magi-X compound.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-michelin-DH22-downhill-mountain-bike-tires-06.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1030\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-michelin-DH22-downhill-mountain-bike-tires-06-1536x1030.jpg\" alt=\"casing construction for michelin DH tires in 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-michelin-DH22-downhill-mountain-bike-tires-06-1536x1030.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-michelin-DH22-downhill-mountain-bike-tires-06-297x199.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-michelin-DH22-downhill-mountain-bike-tires-06-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-michelin-DH22-downhill-mountain-bike-tires-06-768x515.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-michelin-DH22-downhill-mountain-bike-tires-06.jpg 1732w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both tires use the same multi-layer construction with a supportive 55tpi base, more supple 120tpi sidewall mid-layer to enhance traction, and a tougher bead-to-bead cut protection layer on the outside.
