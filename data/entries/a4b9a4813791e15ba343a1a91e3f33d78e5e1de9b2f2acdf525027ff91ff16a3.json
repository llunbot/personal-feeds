Apple pulled the plug on that over fears that a thin device with a giant screen would be susceptible to bending. The company suffered such a controversy in 2014 — \"Bendgate\" — when the iPhone 6 Plus would sometimes warp when in a tight pocket.</blockquote>Earlier this month, we reported on a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/iphone-17-air-same-size-iphone-16-pro-max/\">rumor out of China</a> claiming that the iPhone 17 Air shares the same dimensions as the iPhone 17 Pro Max, with the only difference being in the thickness of the devices. It's quite possible the rumor had its origins in Apple's canned prototype.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCorroborating rumors indicate that the iPhone 17 Air that Apple will launch in September will feature a 6.6-inch display with 120Hz ProMotion support, a Dynamic Island, an A19 chip, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, and Apple's custom-made C1 modem. Gurman has been told that the device may start at <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/iphone-17-air-price-battery-life-more/\">roughly $899</a> in the U.S., which is the same price point as the iPhone 16 Plus that the ultra-thin device is believed to be replacing in Apple's smartphone lineup.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/larger-iphone-17-air-referred-to-prototype/\">Apple Canned Larger iPhone 17 Air Model Over Fears of Bendgate 2.0</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-canned-larger-iphone-17-air-model-over-fears-of-bendgate-2-0.2453301/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a4b9a4813791e15ba343a1a91e3f33d78e5e1de9b2f2acdf525027ff91ff16a3","category":"Apple"}
