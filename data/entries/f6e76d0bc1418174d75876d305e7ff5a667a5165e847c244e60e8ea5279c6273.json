An ‌iPhone‌ on the ‌AirPower‌ charger would have shown the charge of all of the devices that were placed on the pad.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌AirPower‌ was an Apple-designed charging mat designed to charge Qi-based iPhones, the Apple Watch, and ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>‌ that Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/12/apple-airpower-wireless-charging/\">announced in September 2017</a> alongside the ‌iPhone‌ X. It was designed so that users could place an ‌‌iPhone‌‌, ‌‌AirPods‌‌, and Apple Watch on any portion of the mat to have the device charge, which meant that multiple overlapping charging coils had to be included.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2017/09/apple-airpower.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n‌AirPower‌ missed its 2018 launch date, and after a large number of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/09/17/airpower-doomed-to-failure-engineering-issues/\">issues with its development</a>, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/29/apple-officially-cancels-airpower/\">canceled the AirPower project</a> in March 2019.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> allegedly depicting the ‌AirPower‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/21/alleged-airpower-internals-photos/\">surfaced on social networks in August 2020</a>, showing a multi-coil design and the device's internal circuirty, but this is the first video footage of a rare and seemingly functional prototype that presumably leaked out of Apple's development supply chain.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to reliable <em>Bloomberg</em> journalist Mark Gurman, Apple is still looking into <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/apple-developing-airpower-like-charger/\">AirPower-like charging solutions</a> for the future.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nZompetti is an avid collector of Apple prototype devices and has previously shared images of an Apple Watch Series 3 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/24/apple-watch-prototype-may-show-smart-band-contacts/\">prototype with additional connectors</a>, an original <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/29/apple-planned-ipad-with-two-ports/\">with two 30-pin ports</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/13/iphone-12-pro-prototype-photos/\">iPhone 12 Pro prototype</a>, a third-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipod-touch/\">iPod touch</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/27/prototype-third-gen-ipod-touch/\">with a rear camera</a>, and rare <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/14/original-apple-watch-prototypes/\">original Apple Watch prototypes</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpower/\">AirPower</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/05/working-airpower-prototype-shown-in-video-clip/\">Working AirPower Prototype Shown in Video Clip</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/working-airpower-prototype-shown-in-video-clip.2306617/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ydlF1BqkkO0:wuoCwEAE2zM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ydlF1BqkkO0:wuoCwEAE2zM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ydlF1BqkkO0\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f6e76d0bc1418174d75876d305e7ff5a667a5165e847c244e60e8ea5279c6273","category":"Apple"}
