But the Kwaremont is the first time we’ve featured a climb that’s also a beer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brewed at the Brouwerij De Brabandere in Bavikhove, 28km away from the foot of the climb, Kwaremont beer is described by its makers, Chris and Jeanine Van Acker, as a ‘full-flavoured blonde with firm head’ that relies upon a ‘smooth, full flavour with a light, pleasant bitterness and a spicy touch’ to achieve a ‘hoppy character’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, it goes down worryingly easily before its 6.6% ABV lands a knockout blow. Which is a coincidence, as the exact same thing can be said for its cobbled climb namesake, the Oude Kwaremont.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get with the rhythm</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Oude Kwaremont Classic Climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Oude Kwaremont north stand.

At 2.2km it is practically Alpine in length compared to its nearby <i>hellingen</i> brethren, yet pales into insignificance where gradient is concerned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While neighbours the Paterberg and Koppenberg top out at over 20% and 21% respectively, the Kwaremont barely scratches 11%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact the Paterberg and Koppenberg’s average gradients are even higher than the Kwaremont’s maximum gradient, with its own average of just 4% seemingly child’s play in comparison. The numbers, however, do not tell the full story.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-03-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Oude Kwaremont Classic Climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-03-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-03-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-03-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>We know you’re wondering what’s growing in that field. It’s corn</figcaption><figcaption>Alex Duffill / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>When you go to tackle the Kwaremont you will likely be lulled into a false sense of security as you begin the climb from the village of Berchem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turning onto Broektstraat, a silky, winding farm road, the first few hundred metres are barely uphill at all, with the shallow gradients tempting you into going full gas before you even catch sight of the cobbles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do this and you run the risk of exploding like a cheap bottle of Champagne before reaching the small hamlet halfway up the climb. Take our advice: drop into the little ring, find a smooth rhythm and prepare for what’s to come.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-04-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Oude Kwaremont Classic Climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-04-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-04-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-04-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-04-750x1124.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-04-1140x1709.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The crown of the road is the best line to take on the ascent</figcaption><figcaption>Alex Duffill / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>You finally hit the <i>kassei</i> of the Kwaremont just after 650m and quickly realise they are much harsher cobbles than those usually found in Flanders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their irregularity will have you pinballing around more frantically than a Sparks track as you hunt desperately for a smooth line through the rough surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your best bet is to try to stick to the crown of the road because years of heavy agricultural traffic have formed large gaps between the cobbles on both the left and right, which seek to lure you into their perilous gullies to pinch-flat tyres and cause crashes.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-05-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Oude Kwaremont Classic Climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-05-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-05-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-05-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The final kilometre of false flat cobbles seems to last a lifetime</figcaption><figcaption>Alex Duffill / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Sticking with the crown won’t make much difference, to be honest, but it will at least allow you to concentrate on passing over the climb’s toughest section, which comes after 800m – the road rising to that 11% gradient as the village of Kwaremont comes into sight, a visual carrot at the section where the climb really begins to bite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spare a thought for the professional peloton at this point. Since a controversial route change in 2012 – which to the disgust of the Flemish public saw the historic Kapelmuur/Bosberg double-punch dumped from the race’s finale – the Oude Kwaremont is now climbed three times during the Tour of Flanders, including as the penultimate climb of the entire race before the Paterberg.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-06-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Oude Kwaremont Classic Climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-06-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-06-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-06-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-06-750x1124.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-06-1140x1709.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The village of Kwaremont has about 717 residents, including Soudal-QuickStep’s Dries Devenyns</figcaption><figcaption>Alex Duffill / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>When reaching the village, us humble amateurs have the option of popping our heads into In de Zon or In ’t Palet, the two village bars, for a drop of that aforementioned beer and a <i>croque madame met slaatje</i>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, if you arrive on race day, you can find yourself lost within the banging trance tunes and debauchery of the party being held within the village’s square.

href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cyclist-magazine-podcast-episode-40-magnus-backstedt-on-paris-roubaix\" target=\"_blank\">Magnus Bäckstedt</a> once claimed that the hardest bit of the Kwaremont was actually the second half, where it flattens out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the average Sunday cyclist that is probably not the case, but it makes sense when considered from the perspective of a professional race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After passing through the small village of Kwaremont, the road levels out to what is effectively 500m of cobbled false flat. When racing on the limit, however, this will feel like a 6% or 7% climb – one that urges you to drop into the little ring and spin over its unforgiving surface.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-09-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Oude Kwaremont Classic Climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-09-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-09-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-09-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-09-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-09-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-09-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-09-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/oude-kwaremont-classic-climb-09.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>A handily placed mirror for you to check out all the stragglers you dropped with your massive attack</figcaption><figcaption>Alex Duffill / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Yet if you’re racing the Tour of Flanders, this is the very point where you need to wrench it back into the big ring and really put on the squeeze.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s just what Mathieu van der Poel did in 2021, putting in a monstrous acceleration on the climb’s shallowest gradients to drop eternal rival Wout van Aert like a concrete paving slab sinking to the depths of a city canal. It ended up being the race-winning move – but not for Van der Poel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deceuninck-QuickStep’s Kasper Asgreen managed to match Van der Poel pedal stroke for pedal stroke on the Kwaremont before outsprinting the exhausted Dutchman at the finish line, thereby confirming that Van der Poel is, after all, human.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such are the perils of going too hard on the Oude Kwaremont.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/oude-kwaremont-tour-of-flanders\">Oude Kwaremont: Tour of Flanders Classic Climb</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"ab331c0dde1df7069e51400162fc63ca482e90ac18124b82ac52995f3a3bd770","category":"Cycling"}
