{"title":"PSA: Apple's iPhone 13 Pre-Order Setup Process Is Sending 'Expired Pre-Order' Messages to Some Users, But It's Likely Just a Glitch","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/16/expired-phone-13-pre-order-message-glitch/","date":1631789810000,"content":"Some Apple customers who went through the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/iphone-13-pre-orders-get-ready/\">pre-approval steps</a> to purchase a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> on Apple's website or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a> app are seeing the message \"Your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> pre-order has expired\" when subsequently checking their order status page.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iphone-13-pre-orders-expiring.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple customers can use the ‌Apple Store‌ app on the ‌iPhone‌ or <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone\">Apple's website</a> to go through all of the pre-approval steps to get ready to purchase a new ‌‌iPhone‌‌, including checking upgrade eligibility if going through the ‌iPhone‌ Upgrade Program, choosing an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/\">AppleCare</a>+ plan, browsing accessories, and confirming payment information. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe idea is that they can then pre-order their devices with the tap of a button on launch day, in the hope of guaranteeing their pre-order before the first lot of devices sell out.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/your-iphone-preorder-has-expired.2311216/\">For some</a>, however, an unexpected message is appearing when customers return to their account orders page on the Apple website, or look at the For You section of the ‌Apple Store‌ app and tap the card labeled \"Your ‌iPhone‌ is ready to preorder on 9.17.\" \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the app, the screen loads for a moment to access pre-order information before reading \"Your ‌iPhone‌ Pre-order has expired. You can still order ‌iPhone‌ now. Just choose a model and select a payment option.\" A Buy Now link accompanies the message, encouraging users to repeat the \"Save time at ‌iPhone‌ pre-order\" process again.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe issue, which Apple Support is apparently aware of, appears to be down to a processing glitch. Some users who click the link in their pre-approval email are still able to see their pre-order status on Apple's online store, while others are having no such luck.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt's possible that Apple's product order systems are experiencing high traffic the day before pre-orders begin, and it looks as though Apple is still struggling to resolve the issue, but if in doubt, <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/contact\">contact Apple Support</a> and raise the matter to confirm that your \"Get Ready\" pre-order steps have been saved.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has always had the pre-approval process for ‌‌iPhone‌‌ Upgrade Program customers, but the new streamlined pre-order preparation for other customers appears to be a new addition.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ models are priced starting at $699, while the ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a>‌ models are priced starting at $999. Pre-orders begin on Friday, September 17 at 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13\">iPhone 13 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13-Pro\">iPhone 13 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/16/expired-phone-13-pre-order-message-glitch/\">PSA: Apple's iPhone 13 Pre-Order Setup Process Is Sending 'Expired Pre-Order' Messages to Some Users, But It's Likely Just a Glitch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/psa-apples-iphone-13-pre-order-setup-process-is-sending-expired-pre-order-messages-to-some-users-but-its-likely-just-a-glitch.2311236/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zMmmVTTy6Y4:YzELzsJrFss:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zMmmVTTy6Y4:YzELzsJrFss:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/zMmmVTTy6Y4\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b2c916417ce64a92a6cfb4e9f42fdecc87ee036ebee34505d5c6cac7e7351c72","category":"Apple"}
