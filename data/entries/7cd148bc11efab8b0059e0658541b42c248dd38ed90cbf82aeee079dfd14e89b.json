The first beta <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/21/apple-releases-first-ever-visionos-beta/\">came out in June</a>, so it has been available to developers to experiment with for a full month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nBecause no developers have access to Vision Pro headsets at this time, testing on an actual Apple device is not possible. As of now, the SDK can be accessed through the latest Xcode beta in a virtual capacity.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\nApple plans to provide select developers with Vision Pro headsets for app development purposes in the coming weeks. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/24/apple-vision-pro-developer-kits-now-available/\">yesterday began accepting applications</a> from developers who are hoping to get one of the development kits. Apple will give developers Vision Pro \"loaner\" headsets that can be used to develop and test apps. The headsets will need to be returned to Apple at some point, and Apple is asking developers to keep the headsets locked up when not in use.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApp development must be done in a private, secure workspace accessible only by the developers who are approved to work with the Vision Pro, rules that will perhaps keep additional headset details from leaking. Registered developers can <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/visionos/developer-kit/\">apply for a test kit on Apple's website</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple plans to evaluate each application and priority will be given to applicants developing apps that take advantage of ‌visionOS‌ features and capabilities. Vision Pro is expected to launch sometime in early 2024, so developers have six to nine months to work on apps.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/apple-releases-visionos-beta-2/\">Apple Releases New visionOS Beta Ahead of Sending Out Vision Pro Dev Kits</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-visionos-beta-ahead-of-sending-out-vision-pro-dev-kits.2396873/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7cd148bc11efab8b0059e0658541b42c248dd38ed90cbf82aeee079dfd14e89b","category":"Apple"}
