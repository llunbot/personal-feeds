Its privacy team are also working on other potential changes including the ability to remove followers (as opposed to blocking them), hide liked tweets, and remove oneself from a public conversation. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTwitter has no timeline for some of the changes, while some features, like the archive option, are still in the \"concept phase,\" but Twitter plans to let people remove followers starting this month, and to let users remove themselves from conversations by the end of the year.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twitter/\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">bloomberg.com</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/03/twitter-plans-new-privacy-features-hide-tweets/\">Twitter's Privacy Feature Plans Include Option to Hide Your Old Tweets</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/twitters-privacy-feature-plans-include-option-to-hide-your-old-tweets.2309599/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=TzwTkZkX6-0:I08UINW2cck:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=TzwTkZkX6-0:I08UINW2cck:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/TzwTkZkX6-0\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"873ee3c69ee25686daf10a677c3499c26e270109fdb575039a0363dd91bbac43","category":"Apple"}
