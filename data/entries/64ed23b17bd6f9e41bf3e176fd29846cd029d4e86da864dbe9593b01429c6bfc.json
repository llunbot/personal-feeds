{"title":"Apple Reportedly in Talks With Toyota About Apple Car Production Starting 2024","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/02/apple-car-toyota-visit-2024-production/","date":1630582406000,"content":"Apple is rumored to be in Asia visiting Toyota as it prepares to lay the supplier groundwork to mass produce a branded car by 2024, according to a new report by <em><a href=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20210901PD210.html\">DigiTimes</a></em>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/Apple-car-wheel-icon-feature-purple.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple representatives were said to have met with South Korea's SK Group and LG Electronics <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/09/apple-car-team-secretly-visit-south-korea/\">last month</a> to discuss <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a> development, and now Japan's Toyota is being touted as its next potential destination. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has been working on a car-related project since at least 2014, and at one stage it looked as if the company was scaling back to focus on autonomous vehicle software. However, following <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/08/apple-car-join-giannandrea/\">several changes in management</a> and hiring, Apple is now believed to be focused on building a car for consumers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBut to do that, the company needs to tap into a whole new supply chain. Apple is expected to rely on a manufacturing partner to build the vehicles, and though it wants to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/13/apple-car-battery-united-states/\">make EV batteries in the United States</a>, it may be seeking partnerships with established vehicle makers like Toyota to do so.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Reuters</em> has previously reported that Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/21/apple-car-production-rumored-2024/\">developing a new battery design</a> that has the potential to \"radically\" reduce the cost of batteries and increase the vehicle's range.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOne person who spoke to <em>Reuters</em> described Apple's \"monocle\" battery technology as \"next level\" and said that it's similar to \"the first time you saw the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Reuters</em>' reporting claimed that Apple is aiming to begin production on an Apple-branded self-driving vehicle starting in 2024, so <em>DigiTimes</em>' focus on that date isn't necessarily a shot in the dark. However, delays caused by the ongoing global health crisis or current chip shortage could always push production to 2025 or beyond.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">digitimes.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/toyota/\">Toyota</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/02/apple-car-toyota-visit-2024-production/\">Apple Reportedly in Talks With Toyota About Apple Car Production Starting 2024</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-in-talks-with-toyota-about-apple-car-production-starting-2024.2309507/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=w7L342oQJNw:4JriNap83KM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=w7L342oQJNw:4JriNap83KM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/w7L342oQJNw\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"64ed23b17bd6f9e41bf3e176fd29846cd029d4e86da864dbe9593b01429c6bfc","category":"Apple"}
