With sculpted grooves and indents for multiple hand positions, both the K-Wing AGX and K-Force Loop AGX offer very comfortable hand positions, but the new Loop bar goes wider with a massive 25º flare for a 50mm offset at the tops (double the Loop’s 12º flare and 25mm offset).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bar comes in 42/44/46cm widths with 25º flare, 100mm drop, and 70mm reach. Weight is 320 g.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It includes the new bolt-on AGX Loop aero extension, which has a round nose for easy accessory mounting, and included pads and cradles give your forearms somewhere to rest. Combined, they should provide long-distance gravel racers and tourers with everything they need.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-FSA-Pro-Wing-AGX-integrated-alloy-bar-with-aero-extensions-04.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-FSA-Pro-Wing-AGX-integrated-alloy-bar-with-aero-extensions-04-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"FSA AGX Loop alloy gravel bike handlebar and integrated aero extension loop\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-FSA-Pro-Wing-AGX-integrated-alloy-bar-with-aero-extensions-04-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-FSA-Pro-Wing-AGX-integrated-alloy-bar-with-aero-extensions-04-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-FSA-Pro-Wing-AGX-integrated-alloy-bar-with-aero-extensions-04-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-FSA-Pro-Wing-AGX-integrated-alloy-bar-with-aero-extensions-04-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-FSA-Pro-Wing-AGX-integrated-alloy-bar-with-aero-extensions-04-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-FSA-Pro-Wing-AGX-integrated-alloy-bar-with-aero-extensions-04.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For alloy lovers, the new Pro-Wing AGX builds a bar and loop into a single piece for a 472g ergo/aero cockpit. Also in 42/44/46cm widths, it shares the same 25º flare, 50mm offset at the drops, 100mm reach, and 70mm drop. The drops have a classic rounded profile and round tubes, though, lacking the additional shaping of the carbon version.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-FSA-alloy-gravel-stem-with-elastomer-damper-02.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-FSA-alloy-gravel-stem-with-elastomer-damper-02-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"FSA VAS vibration absorbing bicycle stem with elastomer inserts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-FSA-alloy-gravel-stem-with-elastomer-damper-02-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-FSA-alloy-gravel-stem-with-elastomer-damper-02-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-FSA-alloy-gravel-stem-with-elastomer-damper-02-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-FSA-alloy-gravel-stem-with-elastomer-damper-02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-FSA-alloy-gravel-stem-with-elastomer-damper-02-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-FSA-alloy-gravel-stem-with-elastomer-damper-02.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new VAS (Vibration Absorbing Stem) uses swappable polyurethane bushings to damp harsh vibes before they reach your hands.

It can be had with an internal downtube battery, an external water bottle-size battery, or both … and both are 252 Wh. The hub motor is the high-tech bit, featuring a built-in speed and torque sensor that requires no additional, external sensors to clutter the bike, and it has very low friction so it should ride normal once you’ve exceeded the 25km/h assist limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it looks like a bolt-on system, frame integration is required for the control pod, which gets embedded into the top tube, and a charging port that can go pretty much anywhere. And wires are run internally, so ports are necessary. The whole system weighs just 3.98 kg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unrelated, it also has a wider variety of 12-speed compatible chainrings for its cranksets now too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.fullspeedahead.com\" target=\"_blank\">FullSpeedAhead.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fsa-gets-comfortably-aero-on-gravel-lots-of-integrated-headsets-more/\">FSA Gets Comfortably Aero on Gravel, Lots of Integrated Headsets &amp; More!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"6c97292c47d00114f168e40039d69f2232a0860c927ccfe38955a09356fd452c","category":"Cycling"}
