It seems certain that Apple will launch a new series of iPhones–the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1351959/iphone-15-plus-pro-ultra-rumors-specs-release-price.html\">iPhone 15 series</a> and maybe even a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1487037/iphone-15-pro-max-ultra-design-display-camera-price-rumors.html\">iPhone 15 Ultra</a>–but we also expect a bunch of new Apple Watches (<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/677931/complete-guide-to-the-new-apple-watch-series-8.html\">Apple Watch 9</a> and a new Apple Watch Ultra, and a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/ipad-mini-7-specs-design-processor-release.html\">new iPad mini</a>, we may even see <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">new AirPods</a> (or at least new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2043520/usb-c-iphone-15-faq-cable-speeds-port-thunderbolt.html\">USB-C charging</a> for the AirPods and iPhones). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also expect Apple to confirm when <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1670742/macos-14-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">macOS Sonoma</a> will be available for download. It is certainly looking like a pretty major event! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s more information on the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple iPhone event: Date, time and product announcements</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we explain how to watch Apple’s Event live.
