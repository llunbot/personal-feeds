According to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/16/mac-mini-5-usb-c-ports-leak/\">MacRumors contributor Aaron</a>, a string of code written by Apple includes a reference to an “Apple silicon Mac mini (5 Port),” which seems to indicate such a Mac is in the company’s plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MacRumors does not note where the code reference was found. Apple officially released <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-ai-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2377675/ipados-18-superguide-features-release.html\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS Sequoia</a>, watchOS 11, visionOS 2, and tvOS 11 on Monday, so it’s likely the code was included in the release. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Apple has confirmed that a new Mac mini is coming and it will come with 5 USB-C ports as reported by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@markgurman</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/p5QBQmQkfk\">pic.twitter.com/p5QBQmQkfk</a></p>— Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1835739463751782807?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 16, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In his latest <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-15/apple-s-hearing-aid-sleep-apnea-saved-iphone-16-event-m4-mac-launch-details-m13kkabb?cmpid=BBD091524_POWERON&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=240915&amp;utm_campaign=poweron\">Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman reaffirmed that Apple will release Macs with the M4 chip “in the coming weeks.” As he <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-11/apple-aapl-readies-m4-chip-mac-line-including-new-macbook-air-and-mac-pro\">reported</a> back in April, Apple will update the MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac mini. Gurman has previously reported that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2422215/the-mac-mini-is-getting-even-smaller-with-first-redesign-in-15-years.html\">Mac mini will feature a new, smaller design</a> that makes it about the size of the Apple TV and that it will have<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2444570/m4-mac-mini-rumors-usb-a-ports-ethernet-headphone-jack.html\"> five USB-C ports</a>, three on the back and two on the front. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current model includes either two or four Thunderbolt 4/USB-C ports on the back of the case. They also include a pair of USB-A ports, which Gurman claims Apple will drop on the new model.
