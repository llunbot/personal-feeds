new trainer more closely with its Tacx training app, to which it has added new features including group rides and leaderboards, on top of the existing real world video. The Neo 3M plays nice with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/zwift\" target=\"_blank\">Zwift</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/trainerroad-training-software-review\" target=\"_blank\">TrainerRoad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/rouvy-review\" target=\"_blank\">Rouvy</a> or whatever else your <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-cycling-training-apps\" target=\"_blank\">indoor training</a> poison may be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garmin says that the Tacx Neo 3M, as with the previous generation <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/tacx-neo-2t-smart-turbo-trainer-review\" target=\"_blank\">Tacx Neo 2T</a>, can simulate surfaces from roads to cobbles, gravel and even cattle grids, while it will allow you to ride simulated gradients of up to 25% and sprint at a maximum 2,200 watts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with Tacx’s previous generation Neo trainers, the Neo 3M can be operated with or without a power supply. You need mains power to simulate descents and non-road surfaces though, and it also leads to a faster response when operating your trainer in ERG mode. Garmin says that it has upgraded the power supply and the trainer’s cooling so that it can drive the motor faster for a more responsive ride feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The +/- 1% claimed power accuracy is said to be achieved over a greater range of power output/cadence combinations than the Neo 2T and Garmin says that ERG mode also responds faster. As a cool extra, the trainer shines an LED array at the floor just ahead of your bottom bracket, which turns from blue through to red as you ramp up the watts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trainer motion can be locked out via two knobs at the rear of the trainer, should you prefer a more planted platform. Garmin commissioned usability assessments by a Swedish company, which found that riders felt that the movement made for a more comfortable ride experience in all except 3-second sprint efforts. There was no measured loss in ride efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to avoid connection drop-outs when riding or racing, Garmin will sell an Ethernet/Wi-Fi dongle akin to the Wahoo Direct Connect device as an accessory for the Neo 3M, allowing for a wired or Wi-Fi connection to the outside world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tacx Neo 3M will be supplied with an 11-speed cassette, although you can fit a 12-speed cassette to match your drivetrain. There’s a new flippable front wheel riser block, with one side handling road and gravel tyres and the other mountain bike tyres of up to 61mm width. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garmin says that the trainer is easy to move around, with a centrally located carrying handle and folding side legs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Enhancements to the Tacx app</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_0451-Final-cmyk-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Tacx app\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_0451-Final-cmyk-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_0451-Final-cmyk-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_0451-Final-cmyk-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_0451-Final-cmyk-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_0451-Final-cmyk-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_0451-Final-cmyk-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_0451-Final-cmyk-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_0451-Final-cmyk-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_0451-Final-cmyk-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_0451-Final-cmyk-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Garmin</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Garmin also looks to be gunning for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/wahoo-systm-review\" target=\"_blank\">Wahoo Systm</a> training app with enhancements to the Tacx training app. This gives you a mix of content, including real world video of famous ride locations, which is available in standard definition or, when you pay for the premium tier, in high definition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Neo 3M’s packaging includes a 3D barcode, which links you up to content to make setup easier. It also gives you three months’ free access to the premium tier of the Tacx app, for added functionality and high definition ride video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, the Tacx app now has increased integration with the Garmin Connect app, so that once the barcode is scanned on setup, the trainer will automatically be added to your list of Garmin devices in Garmin Connect. Workouts scheduled in Garmin Connect will also be automatically made available in the Tacx app.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tacx Neo 3M pricing</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_HR_1003-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Tacx Neo 3M trainer\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_HR_1003-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_HR_1003-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_HR_1003-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_HR_1003-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_HR_1003-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_HR_1003-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_HR_1003-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_HR_1003-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_HR_1003-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/TacxNeo3M_HR_1003-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Garmin</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tacx Neo 3M is priced at £1,749.99 / $1,999.99 / €1,999.99. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Neo 2T was already a premium product, with its neodymium magnets and virtual flywheel a sophisticated solution for resistance generation.
