circulating for years.</p>\n<p>The motor is made by Brose, a brand well-established in the market, having manufactured Specialized ebike motors since 2015.</p>\n<p>The new Eagle Powertrain delivers 90Nm of peak torque and 680W of peak power and integrates with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-t-type-eagle-transmission/\">SRAM’s T-Type Transmission</a> groupset, which has been praised for its ability to shift under power.</p>\n<p>SRAM has also included smart features such as auto-shifting and coast-shifting into the system.</p>\n<p>SRAM offers two battery sizes – 630Wh and 720Wh, as well as a 250Wh range extender.</p>\n<p>We’ve tested <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/electric-bike-motors/sram-eagle-powertrain-review/\">SRAM’s Eagle Powertrain</a> and were impressed by the levels of automation and natural-feeling power the motor brings.</p>\n<p>With the new motor being released recently, only a handful of new <a

and is available in three models, starting at €7,999 for the GX Eagle AXS Transmission-specced ECC 4.</p>\n<p>A top-of-the-range SRAM X01 Eagle AXS Transmission ECC 6 model, priced at €9,999, features suspension courtesy of a collaboration between motorbike suspension manufacturer WP Suspension and DVO.</p>\n<p>The bike has 160mm of rear suspension with a 170mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-suspension-forks/\">suspension fork</a> up front and rolls on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-29er/\">29in wheels</a>.</p>\n<p>GasGas has given the bike an up-to-date geometry, with a 64-degree head angle and 500mm reach for a

fork and Vivid Select+ rear shock, while the top-end model gets Ultimate versions of the ZEB and Vivid.</p>\n<p>Geometry has been made more aggressive compared to the Repeater EP8, which features <a

Therefore, it seems natural that manufacturers wanting to capitalise on the integration will choose SRAM’s Eagle Powertrain for their next bike.</p>","author":"Nick Clark","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"e9f559586d3d17946ac8926749e76b4079328b2eb5410dd95b06edc38a4addec","category":"Cycling"}
