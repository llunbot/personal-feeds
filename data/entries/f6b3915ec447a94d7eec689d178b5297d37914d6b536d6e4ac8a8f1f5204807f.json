But it's continuing to pay attention to the <a href=\"https://frame.work/laptop13\">Framework Laptop 13, too</a>â€”the company's first upgrade-friendly repairable laptop is getting another motherboard update, this time with AMD's latest Ryzen AI 300-series processors. It's Framework's second AMD Ryzen-based board, following <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/review-framework-laptop-finally-gets-an-amd-ryzen-config-and-its-pretty-good/\">late 2023's Ryzen 7040-based refresh</a>.</p>\n<p>The new boards are available for preorder today and will begin shipping in April. Buyers new to the Framework ecosystem can buy a laptop, which starts at $1,099 as a pre-built system with an OS, storage, and RAM included, or $899 for a build-it-yourself kit where you add those components yourself. Owners of Framework Laptops going all the way back to the original 11th-generation Intel version can also buy a bare board to drop into their existing systems; these start at $449.</p>\n<p>Framework will ship six- and eight-core Ryzen AI 300 processors on lower-end configurations, most likely the Ryzen AI 5 340 and Ryzen AI 7 350 that AMD announced <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/amds-2025-ryzen-laptop-lineup-a-mix-of-powerful-new-and-renamed-old/\">at CES in January</a>. These chips include integrated Radeon 840M and 860M GPUs with four and eight graphics cores, respectively.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/framework-gives-its-13-inch-laptop-another-boost-with-ryzen-ai-300-cpu-update/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/framework-gives-its-13-inch-laptop-another-boost-with-ryzen-ai-300-cpu-update/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f6b3915ec447a94d7eec689d178b5297d37914d6b536d6e4ac8a8f1f5204807f","category":"Tech"}
