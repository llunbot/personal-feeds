Today's preview directly means that just two years after unveiling chips based on the 5nm process, Apple may plan to make a direct jump to 3nm as soon as next year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has already reportedly booked TSMC's entire production capacity for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/30/4nm-chips-for-apple-silicon-macs/\">4nm chips for Apple silicon Macs</a>. That report, however, has no timeline as to when Macs with 4nm chips may debut. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe A14 Bionic chip, first introduced in an updated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> and later put into the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> series, is built on the 5nm process. Compared to earlier processes, the smaller architecture provides improved performance and increased energy efficiency. For this year's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, Apple will use an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/26/apple-orders-100-million-a15-chips/\">enhanced version of the 5nm process</a>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe full report tomorrow is likely to offer more color surrounding Apple's plan to roll out chips built on the 3nm process. We'll be sure to let <em>MacRumors'</em> readers know if the new report shares anything of significance. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">digitimes.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2022-iphones/\">2022 iPhones</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/10/2022-iphones-macs-using-3nm-chips/\">2022 iPhones and Macs May Feature 3nm Chips</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2022-iphones-and-macs-may-feature-3nm-chips.2307118/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fdEuDTblffg:4xFlPZA-AOY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fdEuDTblffg:4xFlPZA-AOY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/fdEuDTblffg\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"699217f0be30e5111722538591468f1f388cf92d95cf64c20bc0fcdaae59fbc0","category":"Apple"}
