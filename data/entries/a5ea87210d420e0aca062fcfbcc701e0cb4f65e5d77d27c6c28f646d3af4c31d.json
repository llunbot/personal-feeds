This means users don't have access to the exceptionally fast speeds that mmWave technology can provide in specific locations such as stadiums, airports, and dense urban areas. However, Apple says the C1 is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/apple-says-c1-modem-is-just-the-start/\">just the \"start\"</a> and that it is going to keep improving the technology with each new generation. Kuo has <a href=\"https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1892605046078259711\">previously said</a> the iPhone 17 Air, expected later this year, will also be equipped with the C1 modem.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's not immediately clear which device will be first to use the refreshed C1 modem, but a rumored iPhone 17e could be one possibility. Apple could also use the chip in an iPad and the standard model in Apple's iPhone 18 lineup. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple's next-generation C2 modem is also expected to arrive in 2026, and will debut in Apple's iPhone 18 Pro models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn his social media post, Kuo also divulged some more technical node details about Apple's C1 modem process technology:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n    <li>Baseband: 4/5nm (both technologies are similar)</li>\r<br />\n    <li>Low-frequency/Sub-6 TRx (Transceivers): 7nm</li>\r<br />\n    <li>Intermediate Frequency (IF) TRx: 7nm</li>\r<br />\n    <li>PMIC: 55nm</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nKuo says that unlike processors, baseband chips do not necessarily benefit from using the latest advanced node (3nm, for example), as it does not significantly improve baseband transmission speed. As a result, \"it's unlikely that Apple's baseband will shift to a 3nm process next year,\" said Kuo.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple claims the C1 modem is the most power-efficient modem it has used in an iPhone, contributing to the iPhone 16e having the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/iphone-16e-battery-life/\">longest battery life</a> of any 6.1-inch iPhone ever. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/c1/\">C1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-refreshed-c1-modem-mmwave-support-next-year/\">Kuo: Apple Developing Faster 'Refreshed' C1 Modem With mmWave Support for Mass Production Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-developing-faster-refreshed-c1-modem-with-mmwave-support-for-mass-production-next-year.2452154/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a5ea87210d420e0aca062fcfbcc701e0cb4f65e5d77d27c6c28f646d3af4c31d","category":"Apple"}
