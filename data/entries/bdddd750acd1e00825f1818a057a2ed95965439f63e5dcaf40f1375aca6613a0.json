As more cyclists keep strapping bags on their bikes, even beyond bikepacking adventures, Tailfin’s new secure Top Tube Pack range offers more easy-access and easy-to-add rackless storage options for riders looking to carry everything from a simple snack or smartphone, all the way up to an extra jacket and trailside repair tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tailfin Top Tube Packs small rackless bikepacking bag storage </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-options.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-options-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"Tailfin Top Tube Packs small rackless bikepacking bags, strap or bolt-on\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-options-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-options-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-options-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-options-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-options-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-options.jpg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption><em>c.

From a technical perspective, a few things make the Tailfin Top Tube Packs unique. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_3-sizes.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_3-sizes-800x400.jpg\" alt=\"Tailfin Top Tube Packs small rackless bikepacking bags, 3 sizes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_3-sizes-800x400.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_3-sizes-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_3-sizes-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_3-sizes-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_3-sizes-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_3-sizes.jpg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption><em>c. Tailfin</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>First, 3 sizes. A 0.8L bag is pretty small, mostly fitting a phone, mini-tool, and some snacks. 1.1L still feels compact while offering more usable storage, including a compact shell vest or jacket too. And 1.5L seems pretty huge when it sits just behind your relatively tiny stem, easily fitting pretty much any packable jacket along with plenty of other small items. You can probably equate it to what you would comfortably carry in 1, 2, or 3 jersey pockets without feeling bogged down.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-big-opening.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-big-opening-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"Tailfin Top Tube Packs small rackless bikepacking bag storage review, 1.1L Flip Lid stuffed full\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-big-opening-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-big-opening-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-big-opening-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-big-opening-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-big-opening-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-big-opening-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-big-opening.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, are 2 closure type, which really makes for two different experiences that will appeal to different users. The zip-opening is pretty classic, simple and hard to argue with. The new Flip Lid versions though offer a much wider opening that will help get more bulky items inside like a camera or even my DJI Mini drone – something you can really do through the slit you get with a zipper. The Flip Lid models feature a magnet that automatically grabs the top once it falls closed, plus a secondary loop that you can then hook in place for super secure closure.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_V-mount.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_V-mount-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"Tailfin Top Tube Packs small rackless bikepacking bags, V-mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_V-mount-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_V-mount-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_V-mount-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_V-mount-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_V-mount-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_V-mount-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_V-mount.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption><em>c. Tailfin</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The last big new thing is Tailfin’s V-Mount attachment that uses a molded rubberized bracket to hook on your frame – actually adapted tech from Tailfin’s other rackless on-bike bags, their Downtube Packs. This one bracket allows you to push a bolt through for bolt-on bikes, or loop their own Voile-style TPU rubber strap for a secure install on frames without top tube bag bolts. Tailfin designed it to work with classic small diameter round metal frame tubes or modern flat carbon bikes, to completely eliminate the small movement that rubs away your paint finish, and without the need for any stabilizing strap around the stem thanks to lightweight internal HDPE support structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_tech-details.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_tech-details-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Tailfin Top Tube Packs small rackless bikepacking bags, tech details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_tech-details-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_tech-details-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_tech-details-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_tech-details-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_tech-details-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_tech-details-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage_tech-details.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A few more details include fully waterproof welded 210D Hypalon/Diamond Ripstop Nylon construction, a full-length internal mesh pocket that helps keep things organized (and keeps your expensive phone separated from whatever else you stuff inside), a cable port flap in the front so you could push through a wire to power a light or navigation device from a battery inside protected from the elements, and the zip versions come with their standard blue zipper pull AND a black one if you can’t stand so much color on your bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>And now on to the Tailfin Top Tube Pack reviews…</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Zach’s Take</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review1.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review1-800x600.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review1-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review1-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review1-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review1-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review1.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After testing a bunch of different top tube packs in the past, I had come to the conclusion that they really just weren’t for me. I found that almost all of them suffered from one of many flaws – they either rubbed on my legs when pedaling, wouldn’t stay put, fit the bike poorly, or they simply didn’t offer enough storage to be practical. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>James from Tailfin told us that their new packs would be different. Sure, we’ve heard that before, but this was coming from Tailfin, the masters of the uniquely technical bike bag. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted something that would absolutely not rub on my legs, so James suggested I try out the 0.8L zip-opening top tube pack. This is the smallest of the range, but it is still big enough to offer useful storage. The bag is tall enough that it will fit some phones, waffles, and other taller items, but it’s short enough that even on smaller frames you can still straddle the top tube without it getting in the way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite use for top tube bags is to provide easy access to snacks without having to stop. The Tailfin Top Tube pack performed that duty perfectly with an effortless zipper that is easily opened and closed with one hand. The opening of the bag is also crafted in a way that is easy to reach inside, but it resists the contents just bouncing out if you’re trying to grab the contents over rough terrain. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review5.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review5-800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Tailfin Zipper garage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review5-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review5-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review5-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review5-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review5.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Make sure the zipper is tucked all the way under the flap to make it quiet. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The only comment I have about the zipper is that if you don’t close it all the way, the zipper pull can be a bit noisy. The solution is easy though – just push it all the way into the zipper garage, and it’s silent. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review4.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review4-800x1067.jpeg\" alt=\"Tailfin Top tube pack view from above\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review4-800x1067.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review4-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review4-90x120.jpeg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review4-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review4.jpeg 960w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review2.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review2-800x1067.jpeg\" alt=\"no knee rub tail fin top tube pack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review2-800x1067.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review2-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review2-90x120.jpeg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review2-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review2.jpeg 960w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>More importantly, the tapered design of the pack means it’s extremely difficult to get it to rub on your legs while pedaling. I’ve used other bags that have managed this feat, but not with this much storage. When looking down from the top of the bag, the Restrap frame bag I was running underneath was wider than the top tube bag. The narrow profile matched with the semi-rigid design of the Tailfin pack means that it’s the perfect shape for unobtrusive storage. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review3.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review3-800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Tailfin top tube pack 0.8l on bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review3-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review3-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review3-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review3-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-top-tube-bag-review3.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Even without a front strap, it’s the most stable top tube pack I’ve tried.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also the most stable top tube pack that I’ve used. It seems like all bolt-on frame packs should be equally as stable, but the Tailfin pack doesn’t budge thanks to the V-mount hardware which is attached to the rigid internal structure of the bag. The rigid connection also means a front strap around the steerer isn’t needed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of the internal structure is a sort of foam insole which cushions anything inside the bag (like your phone) and keeps the hardware from damaging it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As usual, Tailfin has absolutely obsessed over every detail and created a class-leading product. Given that this bag is able to fit almost any frame out of the box without having to buy any accessories or adapters makes it an easy recommendation. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cory’s Take</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-old-school.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-old-school-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Tailfin Top Tube Packs small rackless bikepacking bag storage review, 1.1L Flip Lid\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-old-school-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-old-school-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-old-school-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-old-school-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-old-school-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-old-school-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-old-school.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My perspective covers more of the bigger bags, and more specifically the flap-top closure. While many riders deal with their knees hitting toptube bags, I am usually not bothered. My concern is more the ability to easily get in &amp; out of the bag one-handed while riding for snack storage or a place to keep my phone or camera protected from rain on bad weather days and my own sweaty back (or hip pocket) on sunny days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, honestly already being a fan of <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/apidura-vr-sizing-app-fits-the-best-bikepacking-bag-inside-your-frame/\" target=\"_blank\">another flap-top bag</a>, I was looking forward to more storage options.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-189g-actual-weight.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-189g-actual-weight-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"Tailfin Top Tube Packs small rackless bikepacking bag storage review, 1.1L Flip Lid 189g actual weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-189g-actual-weight-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-189g-actual-weight-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-189g-actual-weight-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-189g-actual-weight-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-189g-actual-weight-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-189g-actual-weight-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-189g-actual-weight.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lightweight is great, and it’s nice that my 1.1L Flip Lid pack was exactly as advertised at 189g with the 2 included straps I would need to fit the bag to my old school lugged steel adventure bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But really the stability offered by those V-Mount brackets might be what sold me on the packs too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This old metal cyclocross-style travel bike has had tons of iterations from mechanical canti rim brakes &amp; mechanical shifting, to modern hydraulic disc brakes and wireless shifting. So it still has external routing on the top of the toptube, so good luck getting a bag there without compromise. And yet…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tailfin V-mount clamps securely on top of my cable guide, and allows the rear brake line to pass next to the mount (<em>see 2 photos above for the side profile</em>). And I can still unstrap and transfer it to a more modern bike in literal seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-stuffed.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-stuffed-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"Tailfin Top Tube Packs small rackless bikepacking bag storage review, 1.1L Flip Lid stuffed\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-stuffed-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-stuffed-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-stuffed-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-stuffed-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-stuffed-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-stuffed.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I love the flip-top style for easy access, and this 1.1L Flap Top bag offers plenty of space for a ShakeDry shell, a full-sized multitool, and a few snacks – all things that meant less in my pockets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really I can overstuff this little bag and it still closes easily with a little magnetic grab. Then, the stretchy loop offers plenty of extra length for me to clasp it over the plastic hook for a visible secure closure. And there’s even extra room for me to over-stuff it a bit more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-closure.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-closure-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"Tailfin Top Tube Packs small rackless bikepacking bag storage review, 1.1L Flip Lid closure\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-closure-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-closure-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-closure-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-closure-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-closure-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-closure-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-1L-Flip-Lid-closure.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for knee rub, this mid-sized bag still gets a tapered shape like the very thing 0.8L bag Zach tested, but this one isn’t quite so thin. I didn’t have a problem with my knees touching the bag most of the time, but it is certainly wider that the steel tubes on this bike, and off-road out of the saddle efforts could involve me brushing the bag’s sides, especially when it was overstuffed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flap-style closure also does make the bag both wider and more prone to catch on your knee. So riders who are afraid of rub should stick to the smaller zippered bags. But I am sticking with this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-5L-Zip-snow-fat-biking.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-5L-Zip-snow-fat-biking-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"Tailfin Top Tube Packs small rackless bikepacking bag storage review, 1.5L Zip Lid snow biking\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-5L-Zip-snow-fat-biking-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-5L-Zip-snow-fat-biking-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-5L-Zip-snow-fat-biking-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-5L-Zip-snow-fat-biking-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-5L-Zip-snow-fat-biking-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_1-5L-Zip-snow-fat-biking.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We also tried out the bigger zippered bag for some snowy fat biking, and came away happy but unsurprised how a bigger bag than the mid-size is pretty much only for mountain bikes with long reach and wider toptubes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tailfin’s own suggestion is that the really big 1.5L versions are only for MTB and only for people who have no concerns about knee rub. That seems fair, and those bags do offer a ton of storage for those riders really looking to carry more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tailfin Top Tube Packs – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_Zip-opening-sizes.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_Zip-opening-sizes-800x320.jpg\" alt=\"Tailfin Top Tube Packs small rackless bikepacking bags, Zip Lid sizes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_Zip-opening-sizes-800x320.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_Zip-opening-sizes-297x119.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_Zip-opening-sizes-120x48.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_Zip-opening-sizes-768x307.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_Zip-opening-sizes-1536x614.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tailfin-Top-Tube-Packs-small-rackless-bikepacking-bag-storage-review_Zip-opening-sizes.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are 3 sizes and 2 styles, only the zip bag comes in the smallest as the flip-top requires the bigger overall footprints.
