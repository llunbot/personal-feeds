And, now, they’ll have unique data for each side of your body, then apply it to almost any bike on the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Velogic’s database of 18,000 bikes lets fitters take the data and overlay it with video to show a rider how they can better fit their own bike, or create the right fit on almost any new bike they could want. It can even overlay your motion from different settings, letting you compare changes visually as well as through data.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/velogic-ORBBEC-Femto-Mega-iToF-3D-depth-camera.jpg\"><img width=\"1671\" height=\"887\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/velogic-ORBBEC-Femto-Mega-iToF-3D-depth-camera.jpg\" alt=\"orrbec 3D motion capture cameras for velogic bike fits\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/velogic-ORBBEC-Femto-Mega-iToF-3D-depth-camera.jpg 1671w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/velogic-ORBBEC-Femto-Mega-iToF-3D-depth-camera-297x158.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/velogic-ORBBEC-Femto-Mega-iToF-3D-depth-camera-800x425.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/velogic-ORBBEC-Femto-Mega-iToF-3D-depth-camera-120x64.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/velogic-ORBBEC-Femto-Mega-iToF-3D-depth-camera-768x408.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/velogic-ORBBEC-Femto-Mega-iToF-3D-depth-camera-1536x815.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The process uses Orbbec Femto Mega cameras linked to a computer, where software reads the input and spits out a report with exact measurements and shows both client and fitter the results on screen as video. The aerodynamics data should prove interesting for roadies and triathletes when it comes online in Q2 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pricing for studios ranges from $1,200 to $1,800 per year depending on the plan, with an upfront first-year price of $3,000 to $4,500 for setup (monthly pricing also available, and subscription does not include hardware costs).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.velogicfit.com\">VelogicFit.c</a><a href=\"https://www.velogicfit.com\" target=\"_blank\">om</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/velogic-doubles-up-on-3d-motion-capture-bike-fits/\">Velogic Doubles Up on 3D Motion Capture Bike Fits</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1a7f785b9cefb2c9c18564535d7aed1d6a0db414afb0d0032e54b3dc4066e9f6","category":"Cycling"}
