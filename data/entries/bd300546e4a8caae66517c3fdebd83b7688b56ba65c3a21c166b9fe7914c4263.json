Most of the exterior of the device will continue to be aluminum, except with a \"Midnight\" bluish-black finish. Today's Vision Pro is only available in silver.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe leaker also recently shared a series of images of a new, Lightning-style connector in Midnight purportedly for the next-generation Vision device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Our next Vision <a href=\"https://t.co/VGAK9rNsrU\">pic.twitter.com/VGAK9rNsrU</a></p>â€” Kosutami (@Kosutami_Ito) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1911069453170999702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 12, 2025</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Vision Pro uses a similar connector, except with 12 pins instead of eight, suggesting that the new cable is part of a more substantial redesign.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to release a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/vision-pro-2-now-in-production/\">second-generation Vision Pro headset</a> with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/03/apple-vision-pro-with-m5-chip-rumor/\">M5 chip</a> between <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/vision-pro-2-now-in-production/\">fall 2025 and spring 2026</a>, but the company's work on a lower-cost headset is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/03/apple-vision-pro-with-m5-chip-rumor/\">widely rumored</a>. The latter could be the \"Vision Air\" device Kosutami is today referring to.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKosutami has a mixed track record for Apple rumors, but they were the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/09/new-apple-watch-magnetic-band/\">first to say</a> that Apple would replace its leather Modern Buckle band with a FineWoven version in 2023.
