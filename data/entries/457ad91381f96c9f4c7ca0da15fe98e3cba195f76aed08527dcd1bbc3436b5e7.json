Adding to their collection of unique footwear, the company will be introducing the <a href=\"https://stomplox.com/trailworm/index_us.html\" target=\"_blank\">Trail Worm</a> barefoot shoe. Last year, I reviewed the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/stomp-lox-slack-casual-suede-bike-shoe-wide-toe-box/\" target=\"_blank\">Stomp Lox Slack</a> cycling shoe. I love the shoe, and it’s holding up beautifully. I should be getting a pair of the Trail Worm for review shortly. Being a fan and user of barefoot shoes, I’m looking forward to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stomp-Lox-Trail-Worm-Barefoot-Shoe-facing-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stomp-Lox-Trail-Worm-Barefoot-Shoe-facing-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Stomp Lox Trail Worm Barefoot Shoe facing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stomp-Lox-Trail-Worm-Barefoot-Shoe-facing-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stomp-Lox-Trail-Worm-Barefoot-Shoe-facing-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stomp-Lox-Trail-Worm-Barefoot-Shoe-facing-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stomp-Lox-Trail-Worm-Barefoot-Shoe-facing-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stomp-Lox-Trail-Worm-Barefoot-Shoe-facing-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stomp-Lox-Trail-Worm-Barefoot-Shoe-facing-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Stomp Lox)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike traditional footwear, barefoot shoes typically have thin, highly flexible soles.

Being so thin means that they do wear out a bit quicker.

This lets you keep and care for your broken-in and loved pair. When the soles wear thin or develop holes, simply send them into Stomp Lox for some fresh rubber.<em> </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Premium Boot Quality, Built to Last</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stomp-Lox-Trail-Worm-Barefoot-Shoe-construction-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"643\" height=\"428\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stomp-Lox-Trail-Worm-Barefoot-Shoe-construction-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Stomp Lox Trail Worm Barefoot Shoe construction\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stomp-Lox-Trail-Worm-Barefoot-Shoe-construction-jpeg.webp 643w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stomp-Lox-Trail-Worm-Barefoot-Shoe-construction-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stomp-Lox-Trail-Worm-Barefoot-Shoe-construction-120x80.webp 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While keeping the barefoot benefits of being flexible, lightweight, and having a natural feel, the Trail Worm is built rugged.

To produce all eight sizes, from 24cm to 31cm, we need your support to cover the high costs of creating each sole mold. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We’re excited to be so close to completion and invite you to join us on this journey. Thank you for your warm support in helping us bring the Trail Worm to the trails!”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the links below to find all of the unique, quality bike bits you want. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://stomplox.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Stomplox.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://ronsbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RonsBikes.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/stomp-lox-kickstarter-new-ultra-romance-trail-worm-zero-drop-barefoot-shoe/\">Stomp Lox Launches Kickstarter for New Ultra Romance Trail Worm, a Zero Drop Barefoot Shoe</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"457ad91381f96c9f4c7ca0da15fe98e3cba195f76aed08527dcd1bbc3436b5e7","category":"Cycling"}
