Amid rumors of a major UI overhaul, Google seems to have accidentally published a blog post detailing \"Material 3 Expressive,\" which we expect to see revealed at I/O later this month. Google quickly removed the post from its design site, but not before the Internet Archive <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250501004611/https://design.google/library/expressive-material-design-google-research\">saved it</a>.</p>\n<p>It has been a few years since Google introduced any major changes to its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/android-12s-beautiful-color-changing-ui-already-lives-up-to-the-hype/\">Material theming</a>, but the design team wasn't just sitting idly this whole time. According to the leaked blog post, Google has spent the past three years working on a more emotionally engaging vision for Android design. While the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/07/android-ls-app-design-early-looks-at-youtube-gmail-maps-and-more/\">original Material Design</a> did an admirable job of leveraging colors and consistent theming, it could make apps look too similar. The answer to that, apparently, is Material 3 Expressive.</p>\n<img width=\"5042\" height=\"3125\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Material-comparison.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Material-comparison.jpg 5042w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Material-comparison-640x397.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Material-comparison-1024x635.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Material-comparison-768x476.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Material-comparison-1536x952.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Material-comparison-2048x1269.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Material-comparison-980x607.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Material-comparison-1440x893.jpg 1440w\" />\n      Material 3 Expressive aims to make the most important things easier to see and tap.\n        Credit:\n          Google\n      \n<p>Google says this is \"the most-researched update to Google’s design system, ever.\" The effort reportedly included 46 separate studies with hundreds of sample designs. The team showed these designs to more than 18,000 study participants to understand how the user experience would work. In these studies, the design team used a variety of metrics, including the following:</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-accidentally-reveals-androids-material-3-expressive-interface-ahead-of-i-o/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-accidentally-reveals-androids-material-3-expressive-interface-ahead-of-i-o/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"79ec930956fe314327c95a0e5c04116964dd44f61c152030cbe51f6ea83401fe","category":"Tech"}
