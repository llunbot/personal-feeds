Oura is one of the most well-known companies in the smart ring space, and it first came out with a ring back in 2015.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRumors suggest that Apple has explored the idea of a smart ring, but the company reportedly has no plans to launch one at this time. Back in October, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> said that no ring is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/10/apple-smart-ring-no-plans/\">in active development</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is said to be worried about cannibalizing sales of the Apple Watch because a smart ring would have many of the same features as the watch. Apple's industrial team proposed a smart ring that would be a lower-cost alternative to an Apple Watch, but Apple executives weren't interested.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nShould smart rings pick up in popularity, Apple could decide to design one after all. Back in July, Samsung <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/samsung-galaxy-z-fold6-flip6/\">launched the Galaxy Ring</a>, a device that works with Galaxy devices and tracks movement, sleep, heart rate, and respiratory rate, providing users with a daily sleep score and an energy score.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has patented ring-like devices, resulting in \"iRing\" rumors, but Apple often patents all manner of products that never make it to launch.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/13/oura-ceo-apple-no-ring/\">Oura CEO Says Apple Won't Make a Smart Ring Because 'It's Hard to Do'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/oura-ceo-says-apple-wont-make-a-smart-ring-because-its-hard-to-do.2442895/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ddbb2fad33785128791180f72d2143b8791109df3219811e73a899aaf8962229","category":"Apple"}
