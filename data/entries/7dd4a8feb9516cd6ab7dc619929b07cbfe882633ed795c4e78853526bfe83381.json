The new name holds more meaning globally, and is universally easy to pronounce, something the original didn’t always accomplish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Ari is and will continue to be built upon the DNA of Fezzari, and you will continue to see it in every detail down to the name,” said Chris Washburn, CEO and founder of the newly named Ari Bicycles. “Our business model centers on providing custom-fit bikes, top-tier quality, and savings to every rider through our direct-to-consumer approach, and we will continue that under the name Ari.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ari-bicycles-logo.jpg\"><img width=\"1821\" height=\"522\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ari-bicycles-logo.jpg\" alt=\"ari bicycles logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ari-bicycles-logo.jpg 1821w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ari-bicycles-logo-297x85.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ari-bicycles-logo-800x229.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ari-bicycles-logo-120x34.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ari-bicycles-logo-768x220.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ari-bicycles-logo-1536x440.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When I interviewed Chris years ago, he said the original name was intended to invoke a sense of flair and style, like Ferrari. But otherwise, it had no real meaning. Ari, however, means “to exist or to be” and carries positive meanings globally. That perfectly aligns with their team’s core ethos of “Be in the Moment”, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ari has eight new bikes coming in 2024</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fezzari-changes-to-ari-bicycles-eMTB.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fezzari-changes-to-ari-bicycles-eMTB.jpg\" alt=\"ari bicycles e-mountain bike with new brand name\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fezzari-changes-to-ari-bicycles-eMTB.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fezzari-changes-to-ari-bicycles-eMTB-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fezzari-changes-to-ari-bicycles-eMTB-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fezzari-changes-to-ari-bicycles-eMTB-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fezzari-changes-to-ari-bicycles-eMTB-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fezzari-changes-to-ari-bicycles-eMTB-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fezzari-changes-to-ari-bicycles-eMTB-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>This is the Wire Peak, their full-power eMTB.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting off with <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-ari-nebo-peak-emtb-is-lightweight-but-goes-long/\">the new Nebo Peak</a>, their first lightweight e-MTB (click that link for full details), you’ll see them launch a wide range of new and updated road, mountain, and other bikes, too.

New bikes will ship out with the new Ari name and branding on it, as shown here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.aribikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AriBicycles.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fezzari-changes-to-ari-bikes/\">Fezzari Changes Name to Ari; Celebrates with 8 New Bikes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"7dd4a8feb9516cd6ab7dc619929b07cbfe882633ed795c4e78853526bfe83381","category":"Cycling"}
