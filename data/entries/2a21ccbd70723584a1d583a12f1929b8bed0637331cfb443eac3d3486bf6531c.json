We can only hope the tech featured in the latest report published by their machine learning team is one of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12493\">research paper</a> and video posted to <a href=\"https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/elegnt-expressive-functional-movement\">Apple’s Machine Learning site</a> showcases the benefits of “expressive” robot movements vs. pure “functional” movements. The hypothesis of the paper is simple: Robots can move in a purely functional way, taking the shortest or most efficient motion from one state to the next. Or, they can move expressively, showcasing the robot’s “intention, attention, attitude, and emotions.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To test the two against each other, Apple built a non-anthropomorphic robot—a tabletop lamp—that can see with computer vision, feel touch, understand gestures and verbal commands, and use its laser projector to display images. It moves via six articulated joints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The similarities to the Pixar mascot<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxo_Jr._(character)\"> Luxo Jr.</a> are striking. It moves and it reacts to the point where it appears to have a distinct personality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/elegnt-expressive-functional-movement\">video is worth watching</a>, as it demonstrates just how much more fun, but also more useful the “expressive” motion is. You can tell when the robot is “paying attention” to the user’s gestures or commands because of the way it moves the lamp to look, as a person would look at you. The functional robot is paying attention too, but it simply performs the action. The expressive robot gives users confidence of knowing if the robot is working or not.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/lamp1.gif\" alt=\"Robot lamp Apple research\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Fail states show the robot indicating that it is trying before failing, while the functional robot simply stops. Ask the weather and the expressive robot looks outside first. When the functional robot reminds the user to have water, it shines a light on it. When you see the expressive robot move the light back and forth between the user’s book and the cup, and then lean down to <em>nudge the cup toward her</em>, you will instantly want one of these in your life.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/lamp2.gif\" alt=\"Apple expressive lamp research project\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And you may have the chance. It’s not quite a smart lamp, but Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2427662/apple-has-several-hundred-people-working-on-homepod-with-robotic-display.html\">rumored to be working on a tabletop robot</a> that could have some of the features explored here. The alleged feature set claims it combines a HomePod speaker, an iPad-like display, and an articulating armature so it can move around. It is said to be a sort of smart home command center (not unlike the “HomePad” that may launch much earlier), video conferencing tool, and media device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We weren’t too interested in the project based on rumors, but seeing Apple’s research into making robots that use expressive gestures to imbue them with personality makes it so much more appealing. Even if they don’t even need a fancy iPad-like screen, everyone will want to buy one of it’s any bit as expressive as this lamp.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2a21ccbd70723584a1d583a12f1929b8bed0637331cfb443eac3d3486bf6531c","category":"Apple"}
