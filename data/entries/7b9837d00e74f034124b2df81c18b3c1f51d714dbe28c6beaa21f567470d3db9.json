Microsoft has been pushing its “new Bing” preview relentlessly all year, and the potential user base gets a whole lot bigger if you don’t restrict the service to a browser that fights with Firefox and Safari for Google Chrome’s scraps.</p>\n<p>Now, multiple users and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/30/23851902/microsoft-bing-popups-windows-11-malware\">The Verge</a> have all noticed a new notification that's being shown to users of Windows 10 and Windows 11, prompting them to use the Bing search engine with Chrome, their default browser. Microsoft semi-regularly pushes Bing on Edge users who have already gone out of their way to select a different search engine. Windows 10 and 11 periodically encourage you to use Edge, and some of Microsoft’s sites will also recommend Bing to non-Edge users, something that many of Google’s sites also do to encourage Chrome use. But this is, to my memory, the first example of an operating-system-level notification trying to get you to use Bing in a third-party browser.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964269#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964269&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7b9837d00e74f034124b2df81c18b3c1f51d714dbe28c6beaa21f567470d3db9","category":"Tech"}
