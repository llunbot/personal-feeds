You can use Amazon Cognito for various use cases, from providing your customers to quickly add sign-in and sign-up experiences to your applications and authorization to securing machine-to-machine authentication and enabling role-based access to AWS resources.</p> \n<p>Today, I’m excited to share a series of significant updates to Amazon Cognito. These enhancements aim to provide you with more flexibility, improved security, and a better user experience for your applications.</p> \n<p>Here’s a quick summary:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"#feat-a\">A new developer-focused console experience for getting started including the support of integrating with popular application frameworks</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"#feat-b\">Introducing Managed Login – a revamped Cognito-managed drop-in sign-in and sign-up pages and a set of customization options</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"#feat-c\">Amazon Cognito now supports passwordless login, including passkey authentication</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"#feat-d\">More options on pricing tiers: Lite, Essentials, and Plus tiers to meet your use cases</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/14/news-2024-cognito-1.1_ConsoleHome.png\" width=\"3183\" height=\"2427\" /></p> \n<p><span><strong>A new developer-focused console experience<br /></strong></span>Amazon Cognito now offers a streamlined getting-started experience featuring a quick wizard and use case-specific recommendations. This new approach helps you set up configurations and reach your end users faster and more efficiently than ever before.</p> \n<p>This is the new Amazon Cognito flow to help you quickly set up your application. You can get started in three steps:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Choose the type of application you need to build</li> \n <li>Configure the sign-in options according to the type of your application</li> \n <li>Follow the instructions to integrate the sign-in and sign-up pages with your application</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Then, select <strong>Create</strong>.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/14/news-2024-cognito-1.2_SetUpApp.png\" width=\"4356\" height=\"4427\" /></p> \n<p>Amazon Cognito then automatically creates your application and a new <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools.html\">user pool</a>, which is a user directory for authentication and authorization. From here, you can review your sign-in page by selecting <strong>View login page</strong> or get started with the example code for your application. Furthermore, Amazon Cognito supports major application frameworks and offers detailed instructions for integrating them using standard OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth open source libraries.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/14/news-2024-cognito-1.3_Guidance.png\" width=\"3690\" height=\"2764\" /></p> \n<p>This is the new overview dashboard for your application. The user pool dashboard now provides important information in the <strong>Details</strong> section, as well as a set of <strong>Recommendations</strong> to help you continue your development journey.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/14/news-2024-cognito-1.4_Dashboard.png\" width=\"5106\" height=\"2987\" /></p> \n<p>On this page, you can customize your users’ sign-in and sign-up experience with the <strong>Managed Login</strong> feature. This is a good segue for me to provide you with a quick overview of the next new feature.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Introducing Managed Login<br /></strong></span>The introduction of Managed Login brings a new level of customization to Amazon Cognito. Managed Login handles the heavy lifting of availability, scaling, and security for your company. Once integrated, you automatically get all the new security patches and future features without further code changes.</p> \n<p>This feature allows you to create personalized sign-up and sign-in experiences that are a seamless part of your company’s application for your end users.</p> \n<p>Before you can use Managed Login, you need to assign a domain. There are two ways to do this: use a prefix domain, a randomly generated sub-domain of Amazon Cognito domain, or use your own custom domain to provide your users with a familiar domain name.</p> \n<p>Then, you can choose your <strong>Branding version</strong>, selecting either <strong>Managed login</strong> or <strong>classic Hosted UI</strong>.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/14/news-2024-cognito-2.1_BrandingVersion.png\" width=\"1307\" height=\"579\" /></p> \n<p>If you’re an existing Amazon Cognito user, you might be familiar with the classic Hosted UI feature. Managed Login is the improved version of Hosted UI, offering a new collection of web interfaces for sign-up and sign-in, built-in responsiveness for different screen sizes, multi-factor authentication, and password-reset activities in your user pool.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/14/news-2024-cognito-2.2_ManagedLogin.png\" width=\"1532\" height=\"1071\" /></p> \n<p>With Managed Login, you can use the new branding designer, a no-code visual editor for managed login assets and style, and a set of API operations for programmatic configuration or deployment via infrastructure-as-code with AWS CloudFormation.</p> \n<p>With the branding designer, you have the flexibility to customize the look and feel of the entire user journey, from sign up and sign in to password recovery and multi-factor authentication. This feature provides a real time preview and convenient shortcuts to preview screens in different screen sizes and display modes before you launch it.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/14/news-2024-cognito-2.3_BrandingDesigner.png\" width=\"1532\" height=\"862\" /></p> \n<p>You can learn more about Managed Login by visiting the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-managed-login.html\">Managed Login documentation</a> page.</p> \n<p><strong><span>Passwordless login support</span><br /></strong>The Managed Login feature also offers pre-built integrations for passwordless authentication methods, including signing in with passkeys, email OTP (one-time-password) and SMS OTP. Passkey support allows users to authenticate using cryptographic keys stored securely on their devices, offering better security compared to traditional passwords. This capability helps you implement low-friction and secure authentication methods without the need to understand and implement WebAuthn related protocols.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/14/news-2024-cognito-3.1_Passwordless.png\" width=\"1307\" height=\"601\" /></p> \n<p>By reducing the friction associated with traditional password-based sign-ins, this feature simplifies application access for your users while maintaining high security standards.</p> \n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-authentication-flow-methods.html\">user pools authentication flow</a> documentation page to learn more about the passwordless login support.</p> \n<p><strong><span>More options on pricing tiers: Lite, Essentials and Plus</span><br /></strong>Amazon Cognito has introduced new user pool feature tiers: Lite, Essentials, and Plus. These tiers are designed to cater to different customer needs and use cases with the Essentials tier being the default tier for new users pools created by customers. This new tier structure also allows you to choose the most appropriate option based on your application requirements, with the flexibility to switch between tiers as needed.</p> \n<p>To check your current tier, you can go to your application dashboard and select <strong>Feature plan</strong>. You can also select <strong>Settings</strong> from the navigation menu.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/14/news-2024-cognito-4.1_Dashboard.png\" width=\"1532\" height=\"896\" /></p> \n<p>On this page, you’ll get detailed information for each tier and the option to downgrade or upgrade your plan.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/14/news-2024-cognito-4.2_FeaturePlan.png\" width=\"1791\" height=\"1093\" /></p> \n<p>Here’s a quick overview of each tier:</p> \n<ol> \n <li> <p><strong>Lite tier:</strong> Existing features such as user registration, password-based authentication, and social identity provider integration are now packaged in this tier. If you’re an existing Amazon Cognito user, you can continue using these features without making changes to your user pools. </p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Essentials tier:</strong> Offers comprehensive authentication and access control features, allowing you to implement secure, scalable, and customized sign-up and sign-in experiences for your application within minutes. It includes all capabilities in Lite along with supporting Managed Login and passwordless login options using passkeys, email, or SMS. Essentials also supports customizing access tokens and disallowing password reuse.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Plus tier:</strong> Builds upon the Essentials tier, focusing on elevated security needs. It includes all Essentials features plus threat protection capabilities against suspicious login activity, detection of compromised credentials, risk-based adaptive authentication, and the ability to export user authentication event logs for threat analysis.</p> </li> \n</ol> \n<p>Pricing for the Lite, Essentials and Plus tiers is based on monthly active users. Customers currently using the advanced security features of Amazon Cognito should consider the Plus tier, which includes all the advanced security features, additional capabilities such as passwordless, and up to 60 percent savings as compared to using the standalone advanced security features.</p> \n<p>If you want to learn about these new pricing tiers, see the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/pricing/\">Amazon Cognito pricing</a> page.</p> \n<p><strong><span>Things you need to know<br /></span></strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Availability</strong> – The Essentials and Plus tier are available in all AWS Regions where <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/\">Amazon Cognito is available</a> except AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.</li> \n <li> <p><strong>Free tier on Lite and Essentials tiers</strong> – Customers on the Lite and Essentials tiers can enjoy the free tier each month that does not automatically expire.
