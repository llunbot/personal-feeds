{"title":"Taylor Swift Endorses Kamala Harris, Encourages Followers to Register to Vote","link":"https://www.instagram.com/p/C_wtAOKOW1z/","date":1726086797000,"content":"\n<p>Taylor Swift, in a post late last night on Instagram:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is\nall yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to\nsay, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to\nvote, you have to be registered! I also find it’s much easier to\nvote early. I’ll link where to register and find early voting\ndates and info in my story.</p>\n\n<p>With love and hope,</p>\n\n<p>Taylor Swift <br />\nChildless Cat Lady</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Given her almost unfathomable popularity, any endorsement is a big deal, period. But this was a <em>really</em> well-written statement. The emphasis on doing your own research about both candidates and making up your own mind is persuasive. For one, it appeals to anyone young who’s leaning Trump but feeling squishy about it, and fancies themself an independent thinker. And it deflates any notion that she’s telling her fans to vote for Kamala Harris just because she is.</p>\n\n<p>Timing this endorsement for after the end of last night’s debate <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@mossbergwalt/post/C_xzlZEOTG-\">seems strategic</a> too. If Harris had done poorly, it would have presented a course-correcting narrative. Or, as actually happened, if Harris handed Trump his dumb red hat, it would run up the score.</p>\n\n<p>And signing off that way? <em>Chef’s kiss</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Social media nerd note: Swift posted this to Instagram, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/taylor-swift-kamala-harris-instagram-twitter-elon-musk-2024-9\">and Instagram only</a>. In 2020, when endorsing Joe Biden, she posted both <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CGDjbq-jhtK/?img_index=2\">to Instagram</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/taylorswift13/status/1313938080290803715\">and Twitter</a>. She has a Threads account but has only posted there three times, all back in April, upon the release of her album <em>The Tortured Poets Department</em>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/11/taylor-swift-harris-endorsement\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6b6b8db3d22b32e662898c6d3858378fd5358df934172fa5320c1196f926f909","category":"Tech"}
