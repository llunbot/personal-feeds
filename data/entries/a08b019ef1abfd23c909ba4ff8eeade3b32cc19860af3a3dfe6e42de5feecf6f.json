Classified says it is so you can “assign custom actions to your shifters” and keep tabs on battery levels. But we wanted to know more…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Classified smartphone App brings new custom control to Powershift hubs</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Classified-Hub_Classified-Power-Shift-Hub_wireless-2x-internal-hub-gearing-plus-11-speed-cassette-delivers-wide-range-road-gravel-bike-bikepacking-drivetrain_internal-planetary-gears.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Classified-Hub_Classified-Power-Shift-Hub_wireless-2x-internal-hub-gearing-plus-11-speed-cassette-delivers-wide-range-road-gravel-bike-bikepacking-drivetrain_internal-planetary-gears.jpg\" alt=\"Classified Hub, Classified Power Shift Hub, wireless 2x internal hub gearing plus 11 speed cassette delivers wide range road gravel bike bikepacking drivetrain\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Classified-Hub_Classified-Power-Shift-Hub_wireless-2x-internal-hub-gearing-plus-11-speed-cassette-delivers-wide-range-road-gravel-bike-bikepacking-drivetrain_internal-planetary-gears.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Classified-Hub_Classified-Power-Shift-Hub_wireless-2x-internal-hub-gearing-plus-11-speed-cassette-delivers-wide-range-road-gravel-bike-bikepacking-drivetrain_internal-planetary-gears-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Classified-Hub_Classified-Power-Shift-Hub_wireless-2x-internal-hub-gearing-plus-11-speed-cassette-delivers-wide-range-road-gravel-bike-bikepacking-drivetrain_internal-planetary-gears-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Classified-Hub_Classified-Power-Shift-Hub_wireless-2x-internal-hub-gearing-plus-11-speed-cassette-delivers-wide-range-road-gravel-bike-bikepacking-drivetrain_internal-planetary-gears-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Classified-Hub_Classified-Power-Shift-Hub_wireless-2x-internal-hub-gearing-plus-11-speed-cassette-delivers-wide-range-road-gravel-bike-bikepacking-drivetrain_internal-planetary-gears-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Classified)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Classified App for wireless shifting Powershift hub users is meant to give cyclists more control and new features, with the aim of “revolutionizing the way riders interact with the cutting-edge powertrain systems”. That seems like a bit of a grandiose statement for a system that only really has two mode – on or off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/found-classified-wireless-internal-gear-hub-shifts-2x-range-on-your-1x-gravel-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">The Powershift hub</a> is simply a planetary reduction gear inside your rear hub that replaces a front derailleur. In <strong><em>OFF</em></strong> mode, you get direct drive from your chainring to the rear cassette. In <em><strong>ON</strong></em> mode, the planetary gears engage and you get a 68.6% gearing reduction, effectively recreating a little chainring without the hassles of aero drag of a traditional 2x setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Classified-Carbon-Wheelsets_gravel-all-road-wheels-with-wireless-2x-internal-gear-hub-built-in_Powershift-hub-system-exploded-view.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Classified-Carbon-Wheelsets_gravel-all-road-wheels-with-wireless-2x-internal-gear-hub-built-in_Powershift-hub-system-exploded-view.jpg\" alt=\"Classified Carbon Wheelsets, gravel &amp;

But not all Classified-equipped bikes get just one shift button. For example, many bikes that come with an OEM Powershift setup feature Shimano Di2, with the system wired into the stock shifters. The new app means those users can flip up or down shift buttons, or simply select Toggle mode where either button shifts to the opposite Powershift gear. Apparently aftermarket upgrades can also be wired into Di2, but voiding warranties. Unfortunately, it seems no SRAM shifters can control the Classified Powershift hub yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Battery level is pretty straight forward. Before you had to rely on LED colors. Now you get precise charge status. The rechargeable rear axle controller is said to last 3-6 months. The drop bar satellite shifter runs for a year on a replaceable (disposable) CR1632 batter for “at least” a year. The MTB ring shifter has a rechargeable battery, and is good for 10,000 shifts before recharging.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Classified-App_smartphone-app-brings-new-custom-control-to-Powershift-internal-gear-hubs_firmware-update.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Classified-App_smartphone-app-brings-new-custom-control-to-Powershift-internal-gear-hubs_firmware-update.jpg\" alt=\"Classified App, smartphone app brings new custom control to Powershift internal gear hubs, firmware\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Classified-App_smartphone-app-brings-new-custom-control-to-Powershift-internal-gear-hubs_firmware-update.jpg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Classified-App_smartphone-app-brings-new-custom-control-to-Powershift-internal-gear-hubs_firmware-update-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Classified-App_smartphone-app-brings-new-custom-control-to-Powershift-internal-gear-hubs_firmware-update-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Classified-App_smartphone-app-brings-new-custom-control-to-Powershift-internal-gear-hubs_firmware-update-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Classified-App_smartphone-app-brings-new-custom-control-to-Powershift-internal-gear-hubs_firmware-update-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Classified-App_smartphone-app-brings-new-custom-control-to-Powershift-internal-gear-hubs_firmware-update-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Classified-App_smartphone-app-brings-new-custom-control-to-Powershift-internal-gear-hubs_firmware-update-2048x1229.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Firmware updates, while sometimes annoying, are an un avoidable part of modern electronics.
