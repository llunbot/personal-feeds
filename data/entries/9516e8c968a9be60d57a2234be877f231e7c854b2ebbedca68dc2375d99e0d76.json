An Apple\nspokesperson has now confirmed this change to 9to5Mac, while\nalso saying that all performance claims remain accurate and were\nbased on a 9-core GPU.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the full statement from an Apple spokesperson:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We are updating <a href=\"http://apple.com/\">Apple.com</a> to correct the core count for\nthe M2 iPad Air. All performance claims for the M2 iPad Air are\naccurate and based on a 9-core GPU.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The second part of that sentence is key. Apple is saying that all\nthe performance claims it made about the M2 chip in the iPad Air\nare accurate, despite the 9-core versus 10-core GPU mix-up. For\nexample, Apple’s claim that the M2 iPad Air is nearly 50% faster\nthan the M1 model still stands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is not a big deal, at all, but still — what a surprising mistake from Apple. Really strange.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/06/ipad-air-m2-9-core-gpu\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9516e8c968a9be60d57a2234be877f231e7c854b2ebbedca68dc2375d99e0d76","category":"Tech"}
