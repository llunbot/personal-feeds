MacBook Pro models are currently equipped with a 720p webcam.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Everything New in iOS 15 Beta 3</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nThe third betas of iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 are now available for developers, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/14/everything-new-ios-15-beta-3/\">there are several changes, including a relocated Safari address bar</a> and other design tweaks to the mobile web browser.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/iOS-15-General-Feature-Yellow.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe third beta of macOS Monterey is also out and it likewise <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/14/macos-monterey-safari-redesign/\">features a redesigned Safari tab interface</a> following complaints.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe latest watchOS 8 beta <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/15/ios-15-watchos-8-beta-software-updates-storage/\">lets users install software updates with less than 500MB of available storage</a>, a change that is likely aimed at the Apple Watch Series 3, as the GPS-only version has only 8GB of internal storage.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>You'll Soon Be Able to Stream Windows on a Mac or iPad</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nMicrosoft this week announced Windows 365, a new cloud service that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/15/windows-365-cloud-pc-stream-to-mac-ipad/\">will allow Windows to be streamed to virtually any device, including a Mac or iPad</a>, complete with apps, data, and settings.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-13-1536x822.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the browser-based service will be limited to businesses when it launches in early August, it is conceivable that the feature will become available for consumers at some point in the future.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>'Apple Pay Later' Feature in the Works</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nApple is reportedly working on a new service that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/13/apple-pay-later-monthly-installments/\">will let users make purchases with Apple Pay and pay in monthly installments over time</a>, similar to \"buy now, pay later\" options offered by the likes of PayPal and Affirm. The feature is supposedly dubbed \"Apple Pay Later\" internally at Apple.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/Apple-Pay-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe feature could be similar to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/10/how-to-finance-iphone-with-apple-card-installments/\">Apple Card Monthly Installments</a>, except with no Apple Card required, making monthly installments available to a much wider group of iPhone users.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/jul-15-2021\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/17/top-stories-magsafe-battery-pack/\">Top Stories: Apple Debuts MagSafe Battery Pack, iOS 15 Beta 3, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-apple-debuts-magsafe-battery-pack-ios-15-beta-3-and-more.2304549/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mt9I-JEdOF4:Bmja16gAX2E:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mt9I-JEdOF4:Bmja16gAX2E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/mt9I-JEdOF4\" />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d8c5d652cc7cb75df254f290a5713f3fe8d2db5a067745f711bcd24158298989","category":"Apple"}
