The coaching software company sees this as a way to give coaches and athletes a fully integrated training ecosystem. The real question is whether TrainingPeaks Virtual can stay in the pack with names like Zwift and MyWhoosh or will they be dropped on the first climb?  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/indieVelo-is-now-TrainingPeaks-Virtual-.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2532\" height=\"1198\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/indieVelo-is-now-TrainingPeaks-Virtual-.png\" alt=\"indieVelo is now Training Peak Virtual\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/indieVelo-is-now-TrainingPeaks-Virtual-.png 2532w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/indieVelo-is-now-TrainingPeaks-Virtual--297x141.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/indieVelo-is-now-TrainingPeaks-Virtual--1536x727.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/indieVelo-is-now-TrainingPeaks-Virtual--120x57.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/indieVelo-is-now-TrainingPeaks-Virtual--768x363.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/indieVelo-is-now-TrainingPeaks-Virtual--2048x969.png 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>The indieVelo website is still active with video and Q&amp;A but now, points the user to TrainingPeaks Virtual. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What Makes TrainingPeaks Virtual Different?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand the whole picture of TrainingPeaks Virtual, you must know TrainingPeaks. For those unfamiliar with TrainingPeaks (TP), it is training software that coaches employ to program workouts, see athletes’ training results, and analyze power data. The software was similar to <a href=\"https://www.todaysplan.com.au/\">Today’s Plan (RIP) </a>and <a href=\"https://www.goldencheetah.org/\">Golden Cheetah</a> but now takes on another identity as a place to train and upload your workouts. This acquisition comes as no surprise, as TP recently acquired <a href=\"https://www.trainheroic.com/\">Train Heroic</a> (a strength training software), adding another dimension to athlete programming. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Better Than Zwift? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I’m not touching that one,</em> but it does offer some unique features that only TrainingPeaks (or a similar coaching software) could offer. TrainingPeaks Virtual claims it sets itself apart with a custom physics engine designed for more realistic and accurate virtual riding. TP claims the platform better represents real-world dynamics like drafting, cornering, braking, and line choice, to better reflect the demands of outdoor riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we can’t attest fully to those claims without trying it. However, integrating training accurate zones and syncing structured workouts from their coach to the TrainingPeaks Virtual will be a welcome addition. In the future, TrainingPeaks plans to introduce other integrations, including workout compliance and syncing of TrainingPeaks zones and FTP.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TrainingPeaks-Virtual-software-.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1096\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TrainingPeaks-Virtual-software-.png\" alt=\"TPV software\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TrainingPeaks-Virtual-software-.png 2240w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TrainingPeaks-Virtual-software--297x145.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TrainingPeaks-Virtual-software--1536x752.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TrainingPeaks-Virtual-software--120x59.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TrainingPeaks-Virtual-software--768x376.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TrainingPeaks-Virtual-software--2048x1002.png 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(TrainingPeaks coaching Login.

A lot of friction creates challenges for coaches, and this acquisition helps introduce athletes to that world more easily.”</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>TrainingPeaks President Lee Gerakos.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Features – TrainingPeaks Virtual </h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Realistic Riding:</strong> In TrainingPeaks Virtual, tactics matter.
