People who want to have tomorrow's technology todayâ€”that's who it's for. Fortunately, there's enough people who are in that camp that it's exciting.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn July, research firm IDC estimated that Vision Pro sales <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/apple-vision-pro-under-500000-sales-this-year/\">would be under 500,000 units this year</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCohen said Apple's approach to innovation can be described in four words: \"Not first, but best.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"We're perfectly fine with not being first,\" said Cook. \"As it turns out, it takes a while to get it really great. It takes a lot of iteration. It takes worrying about every detail. Sometimes, it takes a little longer to do that. We would rather come out with that kind of product and that kind of contribution to people versus running to get something out first. If we can do both, that's fantastic. But if we can only do one, there's no doubt around here. If you talk to 100 people, 100 of them would tell you: It's about being the best.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\nCook said Apple Intelligence makes the experience of using Apple products \"profoundly different.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"I think we'll look back and it will be one of these air pockets that happened to get you on a different technology curve,\" said Cook.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe wide-ranging interview touches on many other topics, including Cook's daily routine, lessons he learned from Steve Jobs, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em> today also <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-21/apple-ceo-tim-cook-is-helping-nike-turn-the-business-around\">published a story</a> about Cook's role on Nike's board of directors, which he joined in 2005. The report states that Cook supported the appointment of Elliott Hill as Nike's new CEO this month, after the shoe maker experienced declining sales and profit this year. Cook is often spotted wearing Nike shoes, and Apple has partnered with Nike on several products and accessories over the past few decades.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/21/tim-cook-admits-truth-about-vision-pro/\">Tim Cook Admits Truth About Vision Pro Following Lackluster Sales</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tim-cook-admits-truth-about-vision-pro-following-lackluster-sales.2440601/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"91f8981db860cec9e04c3bf059f9d7900537e5344ca731e9df52aec0dd6d21b1","category":"Apple"}
