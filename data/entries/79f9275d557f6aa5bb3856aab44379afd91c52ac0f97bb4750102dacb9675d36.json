The following stage will see Saltburn-by-the-Sea play host to an undulating finale, before Scotland is passed the baton for Stage 3 in Kelso and the race’s big conclusion in central Glasgow the day after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the host towns of the 2025 Tour of Britain Women are debutants for the race, but some locations will be familiar to riders and spectators, including Saltburn Bank and Glasgow city centre. Importantly, Scotland will also be making its first appearance on the women’s race, having been missed off the route since the Women’s Tour started in the mid-2010s. So that makes this the most northerly route in the race’s decade-long history.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>The route</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-2024-Warrington-stage-gets-underway-Credit-SWpix.com_-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Picture by Simon Wilkinson/SWpix.com - 08/06/2024 - Cycling - UCI Women's World Tour - Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Women - Stage 3: The Warrington Stage, Cheshire, England - Roll out from Warrington\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-2024-Warrington-stage-gets-underway-Credit-SWpix.com_-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-2024-Warrington-stage-gets-underway-Credit-SWpix.com_-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-2024-Warrington-stage-gets-underway-Credit-SWpix.com_-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-2024-Warrington-stage-gets-underway-Credit-SWpix.com_-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-2024-Warrington-stage-gets-underway-Credit-SWpix.com_-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-2024-Warrington-stage-gets-underway-Credit-SWpix.com_-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-2024-Warrington-stage-gets-underway-Credit-SWpix.com_-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-2024-Warrington-stage-gets-underway-Credit-SWpix.com_-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-2024-Warrington-stage-gets-underway-Credit-SWpix.com_-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-2024-Warrington-stage-gets-underway-Credit-SWpix.com_-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Simon Wilkinson/SWpix.com</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2025 Tour of Britain Women will be evenly split across England and Scotland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The racing will commence from within the Dalby Forest in North Yorkshire, before heading out to the Tees Valley coastline for the finale of Stage 1 in Redcar. After that, the riders will remain in Tees Valley for Stage 2’s punchy hairpin-laden arrival into Saltburn-by-the-Sea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With two days under their belt, the riders will pack their bags and head up to the Scottish Borders for Stage 3’s out-and-back route to Kelso on what is said to be a rolling stage through the Eildon Hills. Then, to round out the four days of action, the riders visit Glasgow for a criterium-like stage on an 8km-long circuit through the city centre before the winner is crowned in Glasgow Green.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stage 1: </strong>Dalby Forest to Redcar (Thursday 5th June)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stage 2: </strong>Hartlepool to Saltburn-by-the-Sea (Friday 6th June)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stage 3:</strong> Kelso to Kelso (Saturday 7th June)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stage 4:</strong> Glasgow to Glasgow (Sunday 8th June)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+5\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-5-970x300.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-5-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-5-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-5-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-5-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-5-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-5-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-5-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage 1: Dalby Forest to Redcar</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Thursday 5th June 2025</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-climbing-a-hillside-in-2024-Credit-SWpix.com_-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Picture by Alex Whitehead/SWpix.com - 06/06/2024 - Cycling - UCI Women's World Tour - Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Women - Stage 1: Welshpool to Llandudno, Wales - The Peloton - Llangynog climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-climbing-a-hillside-in-2024-Credit-SWpix.com_-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-climbing-a-hillside-in-2024-Credit-SWpix.com_-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-climbing-a-hillside-in-2024-Credit-SWpix.com_-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-climbing-a-hillside-in-2024-Credit-SWpix.com_-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-climbing-a-hillside-in-2024-Credit-SWpix.com_-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-climbing-a-hillside-in-2024-Credit-SWpix.com_-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-climbing-a-hillside-in-2024-Credit-SWpix.com_-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-climbing-a-hillside-in-2024-Credit-SWpix.com_-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-climbing-a-hillside-in-2024-Credit-SWpix.com_-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-climbing-a-hillside-in-2024-Credit-SWpix.com_-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Alex Whitehead/SWpix.com</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tour of Britain Women kicks off in the Dalby Forest in North Yorkshire. The remote location will see the peloton clip in for the four days of racing within a Forest Commission-protected site, home to an abundance of quintessential British wildlife.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, the race will move through the North York Moors in the direction of the old steel-making town Redcar, where the stage will conclude. Despite being the Yorkshire town’s first cameo in the Tour of Britain Women, it’s been a common stage location at the men’s Tour of Britain, including on Stage 2 of last year’s race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The amount of climbing is unknown for the moment, but we can expect a rolling profile in the first half of the stage as the peloton leaves the North York Moors. Regardless of how many QOM sprints there may be, the stunning landscape here will certainly give the TV cameras something to dwell on.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/five-british-monuments\">We created British versions of cycling’s five Monuments</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-britain-2024-gallery\">The best photos from the Tour of Britain 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/three-week-tour-of-britain\">What would a three-week Tour of Britain route look like?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-britain-women-2024-photos\">The best photos from the Tour of Britain Women 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h3>Stage 2: Hartlepool to Saltburn-by-the-Sea</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Friday 6th June 2025</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Riders-tackle-Saltburn-Bank-during-the-National-Championships-Credit-SWpix.com_-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Picture by Alex Whitehead/SWpix.com -

The route will then join a gruelling finishing loop around the town of Saltburn-by-the-Sea, with two ascents of Saltburn Bank (300m at 15%) on the menu in the closing kilometres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>British fans and riders alike will be very familiar with the climb, having hosted the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/british-national-championships-2023-gallery\">British Road Championships two years in a row</a>. The finish line, like at those championships, will come at the top of the hill, with the North Sea glistening in the background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This punchy finale could be the most decisive throughout this four-day race, so be sure to keep 6th June underlined in your diary. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage 3: Kelso to Kelso</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Saturday 7th June 2025</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Stage1Kelso-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Stage1Kelso-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Stage1Kelso-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Stage1Kelso-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Stage1Kelso-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Stage1Kelso-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Stage1Kelso-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Stage1Kelso-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Stage1Kelso-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Stage1Kelso-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Stage1Kelso-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Simon Wilkinson/SWpix.com</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The penultimate stage will take the race convoy across the border and into Scotland.

However, 2025 will mark Kelso’s debut in the women’s race. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From its quaint market square, the riders will head out onto a ‘spectator-friendly route’ around the Eildon Hills, similar to the route used on the opening stage of last year’s Tour of Britain Men. After passing through Melrose and Jedburgh, the riders will return to Kelso for a group sprint on the town centre cobbles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage 4: Glasgow to Glasgow</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Sunday 8th June 2025</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1786\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-Saltaire-flies-above-the-start-podium-Credit-SWpix.com_-scaled.webp\" alt=\"The Saltaire flies above the start podium (Credit SWpix.com)\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-Saltaire-flies-above-the-start-podium-Credit-SWpix.com_-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-Saltaire-flies-above-the-start-podium-Credit-SWpix.com_-300x209.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-Saltaire-flies-above-the-start-podium-Credit-SWpix.com_-970x677.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-Saltaire-flies-above-the-start-podium-Credit-SWpix.com_-768x536.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-Saltaire-flies-above-the-start-podium-Credit-SWpix.com_-1536x1071.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-Saltaire-flies-above-the-start-podium-Credit-SWpix.com_-2048x1429.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-Saltaire-flies-above-the-start-podium-Credit-SWpix.com_-750x523.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-Saltaire-flies-above-the-start-podium-Credit-SWpix.com_-1140x795.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption>SWpix.com</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The final stage of the 2025 race will see Glasgow make its debut at the Tour of Britain Women. The stage has been dubbed by organisers as ‘The Glasgow Stage’, with the start confirmed to take place in Glasgow Green, just to the east of the city centre. The riders will then tackle ten laps of an 8.4km circuit around the Scottish city, with the finish expected to take place in Glasgow Green right next to The People’s Palace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The park played host to the men’s and women’s European Championships in 2018, reprising its role from the 2014 Commonwealth Games. At 8.4km in length, the circuit we’ll see in June is unlikely to replicate the one used at the European Championships or the World Championships held in the city two years ago. No further details about the route, including the possibility of climbing <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/montrose-street-world-championships\">Montrose Street</a>, have been given at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside the racing that day, events and activities are expected to take place on the Green, with the city-centre course set to be opened up to amateurs after the women’s peloton cross the line. Given that RideGlasgow seems to be on a break for 2025, this will be a welcome alternative for Glasgow’s cycling community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>‘Breaking new ground’</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-passing-by-school-children-Credit-SWpix.com_-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Picture by Olly Hassell/SWpix.com - 07/06/2024 - Cycling - UCI Women's World Tour - Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Women - Stage 2: The Wrexham Stage, Wales - Lloyds Bank Branding - Children watching the riders roll out in Wrexham\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-passing-by-school-children-Credit-SWpix.com_-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-passing-by-school-children-Credit-SWpix.com_-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-passing-by-school-children-Credit-SWpix.com_-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-passing-by-school-children-Credit-SWpix.com_-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-passing-by-school-children-Credit-SWpix.com_-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-passing-by-school-children-Credit-SWpix.com_-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-passing-by-school-children-Credit-SWpix.com_-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-passing-by-school-children-Credit-SWpix.com_-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-passing-by-school-children-Credit-SWpix.com_-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/The-peloton-passing-by-school-children-Credit-SWpix.com_-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Olly Hassell/SWpix.com</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since taking over the Tour of Britain races in 2024, British Cycling has been overseeing Britain’s two premier cycling events. For the women, the stakes are even higher, with the event being at the WorldTour level and the RideLondon Classique not running this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Commenting on the announcement, British Cycling Events’ managing director Jonathan Day said, ‘We are excited to once again be breaking new ground with four completely new stages for the race. Being able to finish the race overall in the heart of a major city like Glasgow will be a great way to round out this year’s Tour.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although further details about the route await confirmation, Day is ‘sure that Saltburn Bank as a stage finish will prove very popular with fans’.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tour-of-britain-women-2025-route\">From Yorkshire to Glasgow: Tour of Britain Women 2025 route revealed</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"79f9275d557f6aa5bb3856aab44379afd91c52ac0f97bb4750102dacb9675d36","category":"Cycling"}
