Just over a week later, the company <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/07/apply-more-time-play-payments-policy.html\">is essentially delaying</a> the enforcement of one of its most significant upcoming changes: a decree that all Play Store apps must use Google's in-app billing or face a ban. Developers can now request a six-month extension to the deadline.</p>\n<p>Back <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/google-announces-crackdown-on-in-app-billing-aimed-at-netflix-and-spotify/\">in September 2020</a>, Google announced a crackdown on violations of its in-app billing rules. The Play Store rules have long said that apps must use Google's billing system for in-app purchases (so that Google gets a cut), but many apps just ignored this rule without repercussions. Last year's announcement said that this practice would end by September 30, 2021, and all in-app purchases—including subscriptions from the likes of Netflix and Spotify—would need to run through Google.</p>\n<p>Late Friday, Google posted an update, saying, \"After carefully considering feedback from both large and small developers, we are giving developers an option to request a 6-month extension, which will give them until March 31, 2022 to comply with our Payments policy.\" Google doesn't mention the antitrust lawsuits in its blog post, instead pitching this delay as a solution to an engineering problem. Even with a one-year notice of the deadline, Google claims that the pandemic is making it difficult for developers to switch to Google's in-app billing system on time:</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1781297#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1781297&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"050a0b1a7b553bd432546772378692edf6a27cf4b75193e96698d79c69c4d90d","category":"Tech"}
