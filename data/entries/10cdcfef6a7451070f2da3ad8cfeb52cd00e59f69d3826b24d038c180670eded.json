Automotive Editor Jonathan Gitlin's take on the Mach-E was largely positive, but the short testing window he had left us with some unanswered questions. So when a cherry red Rapid Red Mustang Mach-E recently appeared in front of my house, I set about to get some answers.</p>\n<p>In particular, I wanted to find out how good of a battery electric vehicle the Mach-E is. I jumped on the BEV bandwagon in January 2020 with the purchase of a Jaguar I-Pace. In that time, our family has put over 20,000 miles on it, with a good proportion of those driven between our home in suburban Chicago and my grandparents' old place outside of Shelbyville, Illinois. With a door-to-door distance of 216 miles (418 km) that covers suburban, interstate, and country driving, it's a good opportunity to see if a car's range is as advertised and how real-world driving conditions can affect BEV range.</p>\n<p>Ford sent us another Premium e-AWD model with a usable battery capacity of 88 kWh and a sticker price of $56,200. The twin electric motors churn outÂ 346 hp (258 kW) of power and 428 lb-ft (580 Nm) of torque, and the compact SUV has an advertised range of 270 miles. Driving down to Shelbyville and back would give a good read on range and power consumption in different driving conditions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1808973#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1808973&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Bangeman","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"10cdcfef6a7451070f2da3ad8cfeb52cd00e59f69d3826b24d038c180670eded","category":"Tech"}
