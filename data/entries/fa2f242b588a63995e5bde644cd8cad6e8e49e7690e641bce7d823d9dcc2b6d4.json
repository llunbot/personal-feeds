{"title":"‘The iOS App Icon Book’ by Michael Flarup","link":"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flarup/the-ios-app-icon-book","date":1636776000000,"content":"\n<p>Michel Flarup:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I simply <em>love</em> app icons — they continue to be everything that\nexcites me about visual design. App icon design is a carefully\nbalanced discipline with the goal of producing a memorable graphic\nthat sits at the intersection of art and utility. At their best,\napp icons are design, distilled. This book is a celebration of the\nart and craft of app icon design and the golden age of icon design\nthat has lived and evolved on our devices this past decade.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s a Kickstarter project, with books expected to ship in April. Take my money — I can’t wait to devour this book. It looks so good.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/12/the-ios-app-icon-book\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"fa2f242b588a63995e5bde644cd8cad6e8e49e7690e641bce7d823d9dcc2b6d4","category":"Tech"}
