The Apple Watch Ultra 2 easily fits that description for three reasons: It has the largest screen, the longest battery life, and an absolute ton of features. And today it’s on sale to boot: The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ1JMVX\">Apple Watch Ultra 2 is on sale for $839 at Amazon</a>, a savings of $60 and the best price we’ve ever seen for this model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We gave this model a four-star rating and loved everything about it, from the gorgeous design to its fantastic performance for tracking sports and workouts. In our review, we note the Ultra 2 did a fantastic job in tracking steps, distance, calories burned and flights climbed. It also did great when hiking and cycling, but we really found it extremely useful when monitoring the heart rate and sleep quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The watch’s battery lasted for about 36 hours and doubled that in low-power mode, which is superb news, especially if you enjoy camping trips and off-grid traveling. The model that’s on sale right now comes with a black titanium case and a gorgeous black titanium Milanese loop band, which sells separately for $199 (and is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Band-Milanese-Medium/dp/B0DGJHNM2Q\">on sale for $173</a>). If you want a cheaper version, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHNX1SH\">model with the black titanium case and a dark green alpine loop band is down to $739</a> (also a $60 discount).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t miss out on the chance to own the very best <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ1JMVX\">Apple Watch Ultra 2 on sale over at Amazon for $839</a>.</p>\n\n\n<span>Save $60 on your Apple Watch Ultra 2</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ1JMVX\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c949fbfeacf92660b67b45840dcf53c258dc77a5fc86dcb51718a0db67bb466c","category":"Apple"}
