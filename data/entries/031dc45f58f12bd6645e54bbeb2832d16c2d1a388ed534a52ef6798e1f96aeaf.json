Yes, you read that right – Garmin has switched up the numerics for funsies. Or, perhaps they just did it to toy around with all the rumor sites. Either way, the Forerunner 570 is here as the mid-range Forerunner, with the <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/05/garmin-forerunner-970-hands-on-everything-you-need-to-know.html\">new Forerunner 970</a> taking the top-dog spot.</p>\n<p>The Forerunner 570 adds in a pile of features, but hardware and software. Think of it as if the Venu 3 &amp; Forerunner 265 merged together, yet, somehow also added their prices together too. It’s got the smartwatch features of the Venu 3 including a speaker and microphone for taking calls, while increasing the sports features found on the Forerunner series. It also features the newer Garmin Elevate Gen5 optical HR sensor, though, with a catch.</p>\n<p>Speaking of catches, there’s also the price – the price has surged here, up to $549 (from $449). Nearly the price or the Forerunner 965 that was at $599. And yes, we’re definitely gonna chat about this price. First though, let’s run through all the newness.</p>\n<h3><span><strong>What’s New:</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img title=\"DSC04029.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/DSC04029.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/DSC04029-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/DSC04029-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/DSC04029-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/DSC04029-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Ok, let’s dive into all the new features on the Forerunner 570, as compared to the Forerunner 265. Oh, and no, don’t expect a MIP-based version here. Gone are the MIP-based Forerunner’s. You’ll find those in the Fenix &amp; Instinct aisle these days.</p>\n<p>In any event, here’s what’s changed:</p>\n<p>– Added new Garmin Elevate Gen5 optical HR sensor (but no ECG App)<br />\n– Added speaker &amp; microphone for voice calling (with phone)<br />\n– Added skin temperature tracking (overnight)<br />\n– Added past ovulation estimates<br />\n– Added AutoLap by timing gates<br />\n– Added Suggested Finish Line estimates<br />\n– Added Load Ratio<br />\n– Added Projected Race Time predictor<br />\n– Added Heat &amp; Altitude Acclimation<br />\n– Added Evening Report<br />\n– Added Garmin Triathlon Coach training plans<br />\n– Added structured multisport/triathlon custom workouts<br />\n– Added Focus Modes<br />\n– Added Low Battery Alert (e.g. 1 day left)<br />\n– Added Large Font UI Option<br />\n– Added 23 new sport modes/profiles<br />\n– Revamped UI to mostly match Fenix 8 new UI styling<br />\n– Added aluminum bezel<br />\n– Two sizes offered: 42mm &amp; 47mm<br />\n– Weights the same: 42mm is 42g, and 47mm is 47g<br />\n– Battery duration went up, and down (see chart below)<br />\n– Same 8GB storage as before (with music, as before)<br />\n– Price has increased from currently $349 (though MSRP $449) to $549USD</p>\n<p>When it comes to new sports profiles, here’s what’s added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Obstacle Racing, Cyclocross, Gravel Bike, Bike Commute, Bike Tour, BMX, Duathlon, Brick, Pool Triathlon, Mobility, Rucking, Golf, Mountaineering, Fish, Hunt, Horseback, Disc Golf, Snowshoe, Snowmobile, Kayak, Snorkel, Boat, Sail</p></blockquote>\n<p>When it comes to the battery front, here’s how things shake out for the 47mm edition:</p>\n<blockquote><p><b>Smartwatch mode: </b>Up to 11 days (FR265 was 13 days)<b><br />\n</b><b>GPS-Only GNSS mode: </b>Up to 18 hours (FR265 was 20 hours)<br />\n<b>SatIQ (AutoSelect) GNSS mode: </b>Up to 16 hours (FR265 was 16 hours)<br />\n<b>All-Systems GNSS mode + Multi-Band: </b>Up to 14 hours (FR265 was 14 hours)<br />\n<b>GPS-Only GNSS mode with music: </b>Up to 9 hours (FR265 was 7 hours)<br />\n<b>SatIQ (AutoSelect) GNSS mode with music: </b>Up to 8 hours (FR265 was 6.5 hours)<br />\n<b>All-Systems GNSS mode + Multi-Band with music: </b>Up to 8 hours (FR265 was 6 hours)</p></blockquote>\n<p>And, then for the smaller 42mm sized unit:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Smartwatch mode:</strong> Up to 10 days (FR265S was 15 days)<br />\nGPS-Only GNSS mode: Up to 18 hours (FR265S was 24 hours)<br />\n<strong>SatIQ (AutoSelect) GNSS mode:</strong> Up to 14 hours (FR265 was 18 hours)<br />\n<strong>All-Systems GNSS mode + Multi-Band:</strong> Up to 13 hours (FR265s was 15 hours)<br />\n<strong>GPS-Only GNSS mode with music:</strong> Up to 9 hours (FR265S was 7.5 hours)<br />\n<strong>SatIQ (AutoSelect) GNSS mode with music:</strong> Up to 8 hours (FR265 was 7 hours)<br />\n<strong>All-Systems GNSS mode + Multi-Band with music:</strong> Up to 8 hours (FR265 was 6 hours)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Finally, there are a slate of different color options. In this post I’m showing the 42mm raspberry-mango version, which both myself and my wife agree looks great. I’ve also got a 47mm purple one to unbox too. Also, before I knew this was specifically called raspberry mango, in my head I kept calling it the ‘Mango Tango’ version.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_5045.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_5045.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_5045.jpg 1280w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_5045-200x150.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_5045-720x540.jpg 720w\" /></p>\n<p>Here’s the 42mm color variants:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"FR750-42mmColors.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/FR750-42mmColors.png\" alt=\"FR750 42mmColors.\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/FR750-42mmColors.png 1280w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/FR750-42mmColors-200x150.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/FR750-42mmColors-720x540.png 720w\" /></p>\n<p>And here’s the 47mm color variants:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"FR750-47mmvariants.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/FR750-47mmvariants.png\" alt=\"FR750 47mmvariants.\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/FR750-47mmvariants.png 1280w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/FR750-47mmvariants-200x150.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/FR750-47mmvariants-720x540.png 720w\" /></p>\n<p>Got all that? Good, let’s look at some of the new features.</p>\n<h3><span><strong>A Few Details:</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"DSC04103.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/DSC04103.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"719\" height=\"479\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/DSC04103.jpg 1438w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/DSC04103-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/DSC04103-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/DSC04103-300x200.jpg 300w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/DSC04103-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w\" /></p>\n<p>First up, on the back of the unit is the new Gen5 optical HR sensor. That sensor generally gives a bit higher accuracy, especially in harder conditions than the Gen4 sensor in the FR265 (like cold weather intervals or running downhills):</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"DSC04099.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/DSC04099.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/DSC04099-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/DSC04099-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/DSC04099-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/DSC04099-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>In the case of the Forerunner 570 though, they also add in nightly skin temperature readings. However, bafflingly, Garmin is holding back ECG App connectivity. Whether or not the FR570 has the appropriate hardware to complete the ECG circuit isn’t clear, but what is clear is the Garmin Venu 3 is currently priced at $349 and has ECG support. As does every other Apple, Google, Samsung, and Fitbit wearable below $400. Garmin gives us training ratio load that almost nobody asked for, but oddly skips on the feature that’s heavily requested by many, and included in Garmin’s own cheaper products.</p>\n<p>Again, baffling.</p>\n<p>Next, let’s look at one of the new running features, which is AutoLap by Timing Gate. This is designed for races, where you’ve got specific mile markers throughout the race. Thus to get started you’ll create a course in Garmin Connect for the race (or, import it), and then you’ll see the option to enable ‘Auto Lap by Timing Gate’ option. When you toggle it, it shows either MI or KM as the metric.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"TimingGates2.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/TimingGates2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"719\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/TimingGates2.png 1438w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/TimingGates2-200x117.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/TimingGates2-720x421.png 720w\" /></p>\n<p>Here it is switching to miles:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"TimingGates3.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/TimingGates3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"719\" height=\"403\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/TimingGates3.png 1438w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/TimingGates3-200x112.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/TimingGates3-720x405.png 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/TimingGates3-124x70.png 124w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/TimingGates3-300x169.png 300w\" /></p>\n<p>The reason for this is that it’s going to snap your laps to the actual mile markers of the course. This is intended to solve against typical running races where you end up running longer than the measured course distance, due to meandering around people and such. This helps keep your pacing more focused from a lap perspective – as ultimately, the only pace that matters at the end of the day is the timing chip one, not the fake one spend meandering around people.</p>\n<p>Either way, I like this concept (kinda like the Suunto concept a few years ago). I’ll need to play with it a bit more to see how it works in real life though.</p>\n<p>Next, there’s the ability to create structured multisport workouts:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"BrickFun.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/BrickFun.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"718\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/BrickFun.png 1436w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/BrickFun-200x74.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/BrickFun-720x267.png 720w\" /></p>\n<p>Previously, you could only create single-sport structured workouts, but here you can tie together multiple pieces of suffering with specific per-sport structures.</p>\n<p>Likewise for triathletes, there’s also support for Garmin Coach Triathlon Plans. This allows you to create a triathlon goal race/event, including goal time (if you want), as well as which days you want for your long runs, rest days, and so on. You can even search for specific events (or any triathlons), which will add to your calendar. From there, you’ll get a complete training plan built out, which will dynamically change if life gets real.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_3569.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_3569.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"177\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_3569.png 354w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_3569-200x433.png 200w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_3570.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_3570.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"177\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_3570.png 354w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_3570-200x433.png 200w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_3573.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_3573.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"177\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_3573.png 354w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_3573-200x433.png 200w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_3574.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_3574.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"177\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_3574.png 354w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_3574-200x433.png 200w\" /></p>\n<p>Beyond that, almost all the other features we’ve seen are minor trickle-down features like Training Load Ratio, or increased font size options.</p>\n<p>However, the Evening Report is new. This is basically the Morning Report, but invested. This is different from the Daily Summary feature Garmin has had for a year or two. The evening report pops-up and outlining your day from an activity standpoint, but then focuses on what workouts are scheduled tomorrow, how much sleep you need tonight (Sleep Coach), and more.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_5090.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_5090.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_5090-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_5090-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_5090-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_5090-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Here are a few bad cell-phone photos from tonight.

By default it’ll turn on 1hr 30 mins before your scheduled bed time. You can also tweak each component too (for example, Jet Lag advisor and Count Down’s will show up here too). I do though already wish it had a bit more detail about the training side of things (for example, an option to show training load for the day). Still, I’ll see how I like it, in time for the full in-depth review.</p>\n<h3><span><strong>Initial Thoughts:</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/GPTempDownload-720x480.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/GPTempDownload-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/GPTempDownload-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/GPTempDownload-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/GPTempDownload-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/GPTempDownload-300x200.jpg 300w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/GPTempDownload-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w\" /></p>\n<p>I think Garmin kinda missed here. Specifically, they missed the forest for the trees. Yes, there’s a bunch of sport profiles they added in from other watches, and yes, it got a speaker/microphone. But I’m beyond confused on how Garmin thinks a $550 running watch with trail &amp; ultra running sport profiles shouldn’t have maps (when all of their competitors below this price point do, far below). Garmin appears to believe that their higher quality level and other feature in other categories will make up for it.</p>\n<p>However, more confusing is the ECG situation. Garmin sells the Venu 3 at $349USD, and that includes ECG. Why is a Gen5-capable watch that is the FR570 at $549 not including it? This watch isn’t competing against the Fenix, it’s competing against an Apple Watch, Samsung Watch, or Google Watch – all of which have ECG (and more advanced ECG) at $399 or less.</p>\n<p>Look, I get that tariffs do impact prices, really, I do. But these features were decided well before tariffs came into existence. The unit has the storage for maps, and has the correct optical HR sensor for ECG (whether or not it has the added wire to the metal bezel required for ECG isn’t known).</p>\n<p>Setting those frustrations aside, my initial trail run with it was good. The screen is easily visible in the bright summer-like light, and the accuracy of the heart rate and GPS is also solid (as expected). Likewise, I really do like the styling of this particular unit I have. It’s awesome, and shows Garmin coming out of their shell a little bit here. I also like that Garmin appears to be consolidating some of their different user interfaces this year, continuing with the FR570 &amp; FR970. Hopefully, that trend continues.</p>\n<p>With that, thanks for reading and stay tuned for the full in-depth review down the road.</p>","author":"Ray Maker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"031dc45f58f12bd6645e54bbeb2832d16c2d1a388ed534a52ef6798e1f96aeaf","category":"Cycling"}
