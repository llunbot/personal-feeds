The CPU score shows single-core performance of 3,409 and multi-core performance of 8,492. The <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/compute/2737830\">GPU benchmark</a>, which measures Metal API performance for GPU compute tasks and <em>not</em> 3D graphics rendering performance, came in at 32,848.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does that compare to other products? It’s an 18 percent improvement in CPU performance, both single and multi-core, over <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/ios_devices/iphone-15-pro-max\">typical benchmarks of the A17 Pro in the iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>. That phone averages 2,887 single-core and 7,158 mutli-core on Geekbench 6. The GPU compute score for the iPhone 15 Pro Max is 26,976, making the A18 Pro around 21 percent faster. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For further context, the M1 MacBook Air has a single-core score of 2,342 and multi-core of 8,350—with <em>eight</em> CPU cores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The single-core score is faster than anything out there:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The top of the <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/android-benchmarks\">Android benchmark charts</a> is the Galaxy S24 Ultra with a single-core score of 2,145 and multi-core score of 6,702. Not even close to the A18 Pro.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Even the <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks\">Mac benchmark charts</a> can’t match this single-core performance, as the M3 Max has a score of 3,128. It’s multi-core score of almost 19,000 owes to it having 14 cores.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Similarly, the <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/processor-benchmarks\">PC processor benchmark chart</a> tops out with the Intel Core i9-13900KS, which has a single-core score of 3,140 and multi-core score of 21,802 (24 cores, 32 threads).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, the iPhone 16 Pro models will sport faster single-core CPU performance (as measured by Geekbench 6) than any processor on the market—desktop, laptop, or phone, PC or Mac—and multi-core performance that is in line with a laptop processor from four years ago that has 2 additional cores. Similarly, the GPU performs about as well for compute tasks as an M1 with 8 GPU cores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s right, the iPhone 16 Pro has the same RAM, same GPU performance, same multi-core CPU performance, and much <em>better</em> single-core CPU performance, than the M1 MacBook Air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When this architecture shows up in the M-series, we can probably expect single-core scores of around 3,500 and multi-core score of around 13,000 for an 8-core processor. A 10-core GPU design as found in the MacBook Air will likely score 54,000 or more, putting it about 15% faster than the GPU in the M3.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"01b8a330bbbb073cfdd13a481c12ab7c4946d72486758cfa7fb5d0ddd0b562f1","category":"Apple"}
