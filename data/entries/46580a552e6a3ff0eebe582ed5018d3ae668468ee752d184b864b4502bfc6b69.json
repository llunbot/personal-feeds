This year, we’ll see a new record for British riders on cycling’s top level as the total rises to 34. This makes the UK the seventh most common nationality within the WorldTour’s ranks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Britain’s place in the peloton has come a long way in two decades when just three British riders were hired by top-level teams. After the creation of Sky Procycling in 2010, the number grew significantly. Since the late 2010s, though, British riders have become hot properties on the transfer market, with the number doubling between 2018 and 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common teams for British riders at present are Ineos Grenadiers and EF Education-EasyPost, both with six Brits respectively. Following them, it’s more spread out than it was in the 2010s, with five riders at Visma-Lease a Bike, four at Picnic-PostNL and three at Bahrain Victorious. Thanks to funding programmes such as the Dave Rayner Fund and development teams including Groupama-FDJ’s, Brits have been honing their craft on the Continent over the past decade, giving them a better chance of a secure contract outside of the traditional British core at Ineos Grenadiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we get stuck into another busy year of WorldTour racing, let’s run through all 34 of the British riders in cycling’s top division, including Grand Tour winners, Olympic champions and teenage superstars. It’s a lengthy list, and doesn’t even include the one name who’s arguably been in the news more than any other British rider recently – Tom Pidcock, who’s now on the books of non-WorldTour outfit Q36.5 Cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Josh Tarling (Ineos Grenadiers)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995-970x647.png\" alt=\"josh tarling tour de france british\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Welsh time-trial specialist Josh Tarling has become a protected rider at Ineos within the short two-year stint he’s spent at the WorldTour level. The 20-year-old shot to prominence on the track before jumping up to the WorldTour level on the road in 2023. That same year, Tarling won a bronze medal at the World Championships on the elite level, then a gold at the European Championships. Closing out 2023, he defeated Remco Evenepoel at the one-day time-trial event Chrono des Nations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024, he made his Grand Tour debut at the Vuelta a España and he’s rumoured to be starting the Giro d’Italia for the first time this May. Tarling wants to target Paris-Roubaix in 2025 too, having made his debut last year; the Welshman will hope to emulate fellow time-triallist <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/fabian-cancellara-podcast\">Fabian Cancellara</a> who took three wins in Roubaix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tarling is a real thoroughbred time-triallist. He’s already left his mark and he’s sure to become one of the biggest names against the clock in the decade to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/josh-tarling-interview\">Q&amp;A with Josh Tarling</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+4\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-4-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-4-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-4-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-4-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-4-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-4-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-4-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-4-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geraint Thomas (Ineos Grenadiers)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/geraint-thomas-ineos-grenadiers-giro-ditalia-2023-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"two cyclists mid-race, front in red and blue kit with white-framed sunglasses and back one in white with black shorts and a white helmet\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/geraint-thomas-ineos-grenadiers-giro-ditalia-2023-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/geraint-thomas-ineos-grenadiers-giro-ditalia-2023-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/geraint-thomas-ineos-grenadiers-giro-ditalia-2023-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/geraint-thomas-ineos-grenadiers-giro-ditalia-2023-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/geraint-thomas-ineos-grenadiers-giro-ditalia-2023-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/geraint-thomas-ineos-grenadiers-giro-ditalia-2023-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/geraint-thomas-ineos-grenadiers-giro-ditalia-2023-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/geraint-thomas-ineos-grenadiers-giro-ditalia-2023-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/geraint-thomas-ineos-grenadiers-giro-ditalia-2023-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/geraint-thomas-ineos-grenadiers-giro-ditalia-2023-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption>Ineos Grenadiers</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Geraint Thomas is the oldest British rider on the WorldTour. He’s been in the pro loop since 2005 and has been on the WorldTour since joining Sky back in 2010. The Welsh rider has been a perennial figure for British cycling fans, having raced on the track through the 2000s before switching to the road in the 2010s. Classics wins, stage races and a Tour de France victory have all been scooped up during Thomas’s twenty-year career within the pro peloton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite turning 38 last May, Thomas vowed to remain in the pro peloton for one more season. He’s still competing at the top too, as he has reached a Grand Tour podium every year since 2022, including a hard-fought third spot at last year’s Giro d’Italia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Geraint Thomas has already kicked off his 2025 calendar with a block of racing in Australia. He’s set to retire at the end of the season, but is expected to compete in the Tour de France one last time in July.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our <a

cycling career as a cyclocross rider. Having made the podium at the junior World Championships in 2017, he moved to Belgium to race for a Flemish cyclocross team during the winter. After the pandemic, Ineos sealed his signature and brought him into their Classics arsenal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Doncaster-born rider only has one pro win to his name so far, but his support has been immense for Ineos in both the Classics and stage races. Known to his teammates as ‘The Clock’ – a reference to Big Ben (which is, famously, the bell and not the clock), Turner has become a mainstay of Ineos’s Tour squad in recent years, having started as a lead domestique in both 2023 and 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ben Swift (Ineos Grenadiers)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Ben-Swift-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Ben-Swift-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Ben-Swift-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Ben-Swift-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Ben-Swift-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Ben-Swift-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Ben-Swift-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Ben-Swift-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Ben-Swift-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Ben-Swift-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Ben-Swift-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in Yorkshire to a Manx family, Ben Swift made a splash on the WorldTour scene over a decade ago. At the Tour de Pologne, Tour Down Under and the Tour de Romandie, the Ineos rider took impressive sprint wins during his early 20s. A couple of years later, he finished on the podium of Milan-San Remo and briefly spent some time at UAE Team Emirates before moving back to Ineos in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After returning, Swift became the British road race champion in 2019 and again in 2021. During his second stint at Ineos, Swift became more versatile, even riding to a top 20 finish overall at the 2020 Giro d’Italia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the departure of Luke Rowe, Swift will be stepping up as the squad’s road captain in 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Connor Swift (Ineos Grenadiers)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Mens-Race-025-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Mens-Race-025-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Mens-Race-025-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Mens-Race-025-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Mens-Race-025-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Mens-Race-025-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Mens-Race-025-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Mens-Race-025-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Mens-Race-025-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Mens-Race-025-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Mens-Race-025-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>James York</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cousin to Ben Swift, Connor has taken a much different path to Ineos Grenadiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After lighting up the UK domestic scene in 2017 and 2018, Swift won the British Championships while riding for the Continental squad Madison-Genesis.

There’s always been a Spanish connection through Carthy’s <em>palmarès</em>, and this year marks five years since the Englishman made his Vuelta breakthrough with a stage win up the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/alto-de-l-angliru-cycling\">Angliru</a>, which helped him to a third place overall. He’s stuck at it with EF since then and has finished inside the top ten of the Giro’s final GC on two occasions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Prestonian struggled throughout 2024. He failed to make it onto a Grand Tour startlist and he was only fielded to one WorldTour stage race.

Ultimately a lack of Grand Tour appearances drew Doull to a 2022 move to EF Education-EasyPost.

Starting 2024 as a relatively unknown rider on the British scene, he began scooping up race wins while wearing the colours of Astana Qazaqstan’s Development Team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two stages at the Tour of Japan, a stage at the Sibiu Tour, a GC podium at the ZLM Tour and two medals at the national championships were the highs of a fruitful 2024. Those breakthrough results rightfully warranted some attention from WorldTour squads, including EF, who won the Manman’x signature at the end of last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walker is a sprinter, and with few fastmen at EF Education-EasyPost, he should get good opportunities in 2025.

He took a surprise win at the 2020 Giro d’Italia, winning two stages along the way as well as the white jersey. Since then, his form has ebbed and flowed due to a string of injuries, including one that ruled him out of the 2023 Giro when he looked to be returning to his top level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He moved from Ineos Grenadiers to Lidl-Trek at the beginning of 2024, rounding out an almost decade-long stint with the British team. During his debut season with the Lidl-Trek, the Londoner struggled to reach his former heights. His only GC top ten came at the Tour de Suisse and his sole Grand Tour appearance was somewhat muted at the Vuelta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’ll be looking to put this behind him in 2025 and he’s set to be back in action soon at the Volta ao Algarve as part of a calendar that will hopefully see him take to the Tour de France for the first time since 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tao-geoghegan-hart-interview-2024\">Q&amp;A with Tao Geoghegan Hart</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>James Knox (Soudal-QuickStep)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2195966558-min-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2195966558-min-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2195966558-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2195966558-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2195966558-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2195966558-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2195966558-min-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2195966558-min-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2195966558-min-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2195966558-min-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2195966558-min-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption> Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cumbrian James Knox has become a fixture at Soudal-QuickStep. Having ridden for the team since 2018, he’s familiar with the Belgian team’s setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knox, who’s a pure climber, narrowly missed out on a top ten at the Vuelta in 2019 and finished inside the top 15 at the Giro the following year. He is often fielded to Italian races, favouring the Giro over the Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has been slotted into Soudal-QuickStep’s ever-growing mountain train as part of the squad’s GC pivot. He’ll likely follow a similar programme to Remco Evenepoel in 2025 as part of the Belgian’s preparation for the Tour de France. As for Knox, he’ll be riding either the Giro or Vuelta.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-only-brit-at-deceuninck-quickstep-james-knox-qa\"> Q&amp;A with James Knox</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ethan Hayter (Soudal-QuickStep)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-5-970x647.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-5-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-5-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-5-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-5-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-5-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-5-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-5-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-5-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-5-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-5.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Oman Cycling Association/Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ethan Hayter is another rider with a track background.

Last year, he finished runner-up at Paris-Roubaix Espoirs and claimed the U23 national title. A series of top tens on sprint finishes at stage races also caught the attention of WorldTour scouts and Donaldson was soon snapped up by Jayco-AlUla.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mancunian hopes to develop into a Classics rider.

In 2017, Double moved to Italy to immerse himself in its domestic scene. A couple of years later, he was climbing through the continental ranks before signing for China Glory (a Chinese team, unsurprisingly) in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He impressed for China Glory, with a top ten overall at the Tour of Slovenia, which was won by Tadej Pogačar. He was soon picked up by Human Powered Health until the men’s team folded at the end of 2023, then receiving a last minute contract from Italian team Polti-Kometa. Yet another solid year of GC performances warranted extra attention and a WorldTour contract soon came his way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, the 28-year-old will be making his WorldTour debut with Jayco-AlUla. He’s already raced in the Middle East, supporting Chris Harper at the Tour of Oman.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sean Flynn (Picnic-PostNL)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Sean-Flynn-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Sean-Flynn-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Sean-Flynn-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Sean-Flynn-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Sean-Flynn-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Sean-Flynn-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Sean-Flynn-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Sean-Flynn-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Sean-Flynn-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Sean-Flynn-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Sean-Flynn-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Picnic-PostNL/Alessandro Perrone</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sean Flynn is another Scottish rider in the WorldTour. Born in Edinburgh, he started racing through cyclocross and mountain biking. He became the junior British Champion in both disciplines, but he eventually switched his focus to the road in 2021 after signing for SEG Racing Academy, one of the most prestigious youth teams in Europe. Proving himself as a solid sprinter during his time at SEG and then Tudor Pro Cycling’s development squad, Flynn signed a contract with Team DSM, now Picnic-PostNL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the WorldTour level, Flynn has specialised as a hardy sprinter. He was awarded a spot at the 2023 Vuelta a España and wore the polka-dot jersey for one stage. In 2024, he made steady progress in the sprints, particularly at flatter stage races like the Tour of Denmark and Tour of Britain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Scotsman has already reached the podium in 2025 at the Tour of Oman.

His strengths lie in the mountains, so GC top tens and summit finales will be of interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Max Poole (Picnic-PostNL)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-2169297961-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-2169297961-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-2169297961-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-2169297961-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-2169297961-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-2169297961-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-2169297961-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-2169297961-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-2169297961-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-2169297961-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-2169297961-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Max Poole of Picnic-PostNL first caught headlines in 2023 when he narrowly missed out on a podium finish overall at the Tour de Romandie.

Many will be expecting him to crack the top ranks of GC.

British Cycling identified his talent early on and signed him up onto the Olympic pipeline. He picked up a world title on the track in 2013 but soon transitioned to the road full-time after receiving a WorldTour contract with GreenEdge (now Jayco-AlUla).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a brief suspension during 2016, Yates returned to the Grand Tour stage to win a stage at the Vuelta a España. This was just a precursor for a bullish set of Grand Tours towards the end of the 2010s, including a white jersey win at the Tour de France, his fateful 2018 Giro d’Italia rollercoaster and an overall victory at the Vuelta in 2018. More Grand Tour success was to come for Yates, with a set of Tour and Giro stages, a podium finish at the Giro and a fourth overall at the Tour.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>2025 marks a new beginning for the former Vuelta champion. He’s left Jayco-AlUla after a decade spent with the team in favour of a new role at Visma-Lease a Bike. He’ll be settling into a super domestique-turned-leader role at the Dutch team, balancing support for Jonas Vingegaard with his own stage race objectives. We’ll see how this unfolds when he begins his season at Tirreno-Adriatico in March.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/simon-yates-profile\">profile on Simon Yates</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Adam Yates (UAE Team Emirates XRG)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6-970x647.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Oman Cycling Association/Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We round out the list with Adam Yates, Britain’s most recent Tour podium finisher and the highest British rider in the 2024 UCI rankings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike his brother, Adam moved to France to start road racing from a young age. He was picked up by GreenEdge in 2014 and hit the ground running with the Australian team with his first pro win at the elite level coming aged 21 at the Tour of Turkey. The following year, he claimed his first WorldTour win and immediately became one of the hottest young talents in the pro peloton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He showed his GC promise early on, with top tens at the Giro and Tour during his early 20s. However, he stepped up in the 2020s to take a string of stage race victories, including the UAE Tour, Tour de Romandie, Tour de Suisse and the Volta a Catalunya. After a brief stint at Ineos, Yates moved to UAE Team Emirates to become a super domestique for Tour winner Tadej Pogačar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While riding for UAE, Yates has enjoyed his best seasons to date with a podium place at the Tour, two Grand Tour stage wins and a brief stint in the <em>maillot jaune</em>. He’s started 2025 where he left off at the Tour of Oman, securing the overall title there to add to his victory from last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yates will be riding both the Giro d’Italia and the Tour de France in 2025. He’ll tackle the <em>Corsa Rosa</em> as team leader before sacrificing himself for Pogačar on French roads this July.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/british-worldtour-riders-men\">Meet the 34 British riders in the men’s WorldTour in 2025</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"46580a552e6a3ff0eebe582ed5018d3ae668468ee752d184b864b4502bfc6b69","category":"Cycling"}
