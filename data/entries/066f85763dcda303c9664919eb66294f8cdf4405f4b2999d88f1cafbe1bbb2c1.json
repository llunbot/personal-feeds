Last week, however, display industry analyst Ross Young said Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/\">developing a new 27-inch display with mini-LEDs</a> that could launch in late 2025 or early 2026. Young believes this display could be a new Studio Display with mini-LED backlighting.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMini-LED technology would provide benefits such as increased brightness and higher contrast ratio compared to the current Studio Display with LEDs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple released the Studio Display in March 2022, alongside the Mac Studio. It has a 5K resolution, a 60Hz refresh rate, up to 600 nits brightness, a camera and speakers, one Thunderbolt 3 port, and three USB-C ports. U.S. pricing starts at $1,599.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/\">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/\">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77\">Mac Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/16/new-studio-display-per-mark-gurman/\">Apple is 'Ramping Up' Work on a New Studio Display</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-is-ramping-up-work-on-a-new-studio-display.2449487/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"066f85763dcda303c9664919eb66294f8cdf4405f4b2999d88f1cafbe1bbb2c1","category":"Apple"}
