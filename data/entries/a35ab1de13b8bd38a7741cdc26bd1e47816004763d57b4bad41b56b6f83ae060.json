{"title":"This half-off Beats Solo 4 headphones deal is music to our ears","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2544831/this-half-off-beats-solo-4-headphones-deal-is-music-to-our-ears.html","date":1733336526000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Black Friday may be over, but some of our favorite deals are still going strong. Like this one: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZPLV566/\">Amazon is selling the Beats Solo 4 headphones for $100 right now</a>, half off the MSRP, and a perfect holiday gift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Beats Solo 4 delivers an amazing 50 hours of listening time, and when you’re in a hurry and the battery is low, a quick 10-minute charge gives you an extra 5 hours of fun listening to whatever’s on your 2024 Spotify Wrapped (or Apple Music’s Replay, or Amazon Music Delivered, you get the drift).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2323315/beats-solo-4-review.html\">our review</a>, we appreciated the excellent Apple and Android support and the many improvements this model brings to the table. For instance, since they no longer have Apple’s W1 chip, it won’t just quickly pair to Apple devices but also to Android ones. Plus, it won’t work only with Apple’s Find My network but also with Google’s. Also super useful is the fact that the Solo 4 headphones have a Type-C port rather than the micro-USB the previous version did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we noted in the review, the features and audio quality delivered by the Beats Solo 4 are worth it at full price, but now that <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZPLV566/\">they’re just under $100</a>, they’re a downright steal. So get your order in at Amazon before the deal expires.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZPLV566/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a35ab1de13b8bd38a7741cdc26bd1e47816004763d57b4bad41b56b6f83ae060","category":"Apple"}
