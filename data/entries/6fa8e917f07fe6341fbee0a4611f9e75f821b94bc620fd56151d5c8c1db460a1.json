Despite the FCC requiring TV stations, cable operators, and satellite providers to ensure that commercials don’t bring a sudden spike in decibels, complaints around loud commercials “took a troubling jump” in 2024, the government body said on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Under The Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act, broadcast, cable, and satellite TV providers are required to ensure that commercials “have the same average volume as the programs they accompany,” <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/enforcement/areas/sound-volume-commercials-calm-act\">per the FCC</a>. The FCC’s rules about the volume of commercials <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/12/the-calm-act-finally-puts-the-muzzle-on-loud-tv-commercials/\">took effect in December 2012</a>. The law also requires linear TV providers to use the Advanced Television Systems Committee's (<a href=\"https://www.atsc.org/about/\">ATSC’s</a>) <a href=\"https://www.atsc.org/atsc-documents/a85-techniques-for-establishing-and-maintaining-audio-loudness-for-digital-television/\">recommended practices</a>. The practices include guidance around production, post production, metadata systems usage, and controlling dynamic range. If followed, the recommendations “result in consistency in loudness and avoidance of signal clipping,” per the ATSC [<a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A85-2013.pdf\">PDF</a>]. The guidance reads:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If all programs and commercials were produced at a consistent average loudness, and if the loudness of the mix is preserved through the production, distribution, and delivery chain, listeners would not be subjected to annoying changes in loudness within and between programs.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As spotted by <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/are-tv-commercials-too-loud-fcc-to-investigate-eyes-streaming-services\">PC Mag</a>, the FCC claimed this week that The Calm Act initially reduced complaints about commercials aggressively blaring from TVs. However, the agency is seeing an uptick in grievances. The FCC said it received \"approximately\" 750 complaints in 2022, 825 in 2023, and \"at least\" 1,700 in 2024 [<a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/FCC.pdf\">PDF</a>].</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/commercials-are-still-too-loud-say-thousands-of-recent-fcc-complaints/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/commercials-are-still-too-loud-say-thousands-of-recent-fcc-complaints/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6fa8e917f07fe6341fbee0a4611f9e75f821b94bc620fd56151d5c8c1db460a1","category":"Tech"}
