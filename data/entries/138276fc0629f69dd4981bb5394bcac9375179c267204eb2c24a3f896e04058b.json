Both are removable and can be replaced.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple plans to offer the Light Seal in a wide range of size and shape options. The magnets in the Light Seal adhere to the curved display, and it's important to have the right size. The Light Seal needs to fit firmly against the face to keep light out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe headband snaps on to the Audio Straps that include speakers that provide spatial audio. Apple designed the headband from a flexible, 3D knitted material with a ribbed structure that is designed to be comfortable to wear. It is breathable while offering stretch, and a fit dial customizes the size to each individual's head.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple when introducing the Vision Pro said that the headband can be removed and exchanged for a different size, indicating headbands will also come with size options. Apple also said a \"different kind of band\" could be used, so there is an open possibility for Apple to make other Apple Vision bands in the future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are also opportunities for third-party manufacturers to create seal and band accessories for Apple Vision, and we've already seen some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/first-third-party-headbands-for-apple-vision-pro/\">third-party band options</a>. In the future, Apple Vision may work a lot like the Apple Watch, with a multitude of bands to choose from.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/apple-vision-pro-headbands-light-seal/\">Apple's Vision Pro Headset Features Swappable Headbands and Light Seal</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-vision-pro-headset-features-swappable-headbands-and-light-seal.2391939/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"138276fc0629f69dd4981bb5394bcac9375179c267204eb2c24a3f896e04058b","category":"Apple"}
