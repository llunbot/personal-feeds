{"title":"Digital Wallets and Per-Merchant Card Numbers","link":"https://birchtree.me/blog/digital-wallets-and-the-only-apple-pay-does-this-mythology/","date":1711237184000,"content":"\n<p>Matt Birchler, writing at Birchtree:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It’s notable that it’s called a DPAN and not “the Apple Pay \nnumber” — it’s a generic term, and that’s because this is a \nstandard feature of digital wallets everywhere, not just Apple \nPay. Google Pay and Samsung Pay are the biggest other digital \nwallets in the U.S. and they both do exactly the same thing. While \nit’s not technically using a DPAN since the payment runs through \ndifferent companies, Amazon Pay and Shop Pay buttons also obscure \nthe actual FPAN (full card number) from merchants. </p>\n\n<p><em>I feel like this comes up a lot, but I can not stress enough to \nyou how little merchants want to ever ever ever handle your actual \ncredit card number. It adds so much risk on their end and modern \npayment acceptance tools make it easy to collect payment details \nin a way that makes sure as few people as possible have access to \nthe real card info.</em> </p>\n\n<p>Gruber mentions banks absolutely not wanting to use DPANs \nthemselves, but we actually don’t need to speculate about this, we \nhave this info already. Numerous banks from Walls Fargo to Chase \nto Bank of America have (or had) digital wallets, all of which \nused DPANs to protect your plain text account number. <a href=\"https://www.paze.com/\">Paze</a> \nis what a few big U.S. banks use today and it of course uses DPANs \nas well. In fact the top reason they give for why you should use \nPaze is, “Paze does not share your actual card number with the \nmerchant.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/23/birchler-digital-wallets\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"acffd799d0b8cd03bc322c99d71a07a9baeaf4ce614f926813ce4bf860125313","category":"Tech"}
