{"title":"Claim Chowder: October 2022 Rumors Regarding the iPhone 16e (a.k.a. ‘SE 4’)","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/09/iphone-se-4-to-feature-6-1-inch-display-with-notch/","date":1741100359000,"content":"\n<p>Hartley Charlton, writing for MacRumors in October 2022:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The fourth-generation iPhone SE will feature a 6.1-inch LCD\ndisplay and a “notch” cutout at the top of the display, according\nto Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) analyst Ross Young.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Good call on the size and notch, but the 16e display is OLED, not LCD. Overall, though, I’ll award Young a Being Right Point for this call from 2022.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Moving to an all-screen design, there will no longer be space for\na capacitive Touch ID Home button in the device’s bottom bezel.\nMultiple reports, including information from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/22/iphone-se-3-feature-xr-design-touch-id-last-lcd/\">MyDrivers</a> and\nApple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/05/kuo-iphone-without-lightning-connector-2021/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> suggest that Apple is planning\nto add a Touch ID Side button to the iPhone SE, much like the iPad\nAir and iPad mini.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Real shocker there that Kuo and the fabulists at “MyDrivers” were wrong on that. If you follow Charlton’s link on Kuo’s name above, it points to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/05/kuo-iphone-without-lightning-connector-2021/\">this 2019 report</a> wherein Kuo reported that Apple was planning a 2021 iPhone that would have neither a Lightning nor USB-C port “and provide the completely wireless experience”.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/iphone-16e-claim-chowder-young\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1a3679e7dcac61803e27f2b4a045357f25e685824981d8da42524903424e06be","category":"Tech"}
