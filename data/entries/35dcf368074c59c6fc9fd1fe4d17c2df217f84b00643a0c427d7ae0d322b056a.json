However, this change is only visible in vehicles with a larger center display. For example, a MacRumors Forums member <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-4-beta-1-bug-fixes-changes-and-improvements.2449908/post-33753569\">noticed the change</a> in a Toyota Tundra with a 14-inch screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn our testing, CarPlay still showed two rows of four icons in a Honda Civic with a 9-inch screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile this is only a minor change, CarPlay showing more icons when possible is a nice quality-of-life improvement, allowing drivers to quickly access more apps with less swiping between pages and keep their eyes on the road.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 18.4 is currently in beta testing. The software update will be released to the general public in early April, according to Apple's website.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, the Apple Maps electric vehicle routing feature on CarPlay <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ford-apple-maps-ev-routing-nacs/\">gained support for the North American Charging System (NACS)</a> charging connector standard this week. Ford recently began selling an adapter that allows its Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning vehicles to be charged by a Tesla Supercharger, and now the Apple Maps electric vehicle routing feature can plan routes that include stops at Tesla Superchargers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ford-nacs-ev-routing.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nFord says this capability is available now on CarPlay with an iPhone running iOS 17 or later, so no new software update is required.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere are Ford's instructions on how to use the feature:<blockquote>- Connect your Apple iPhone to CarPlay.\r<br />\n- Open Apple Maps, go to Settings and confirm your preferred charging network(s) – make sure you select a NACS fast charging station, such as Tesla Supercharger. You only have to do this once.\r<br />\n- Enter a destination.\r<br />\n- Apple Maps will then calculate the estimated state of charge you will have when you get to a destination.\r<br />\n- If a charge is required, depending on the fastest route, it will automatically route you to a NACS fast charging station.*\r<br />\n\r<br />\n* When a route is started that includes Tesla Superchargers, drivers may see a warning that the route requires a Fast Charging Adapter (NACS) – drivers should make sure to have it with them to use. Battery preconditioning when enroute to a charger is not available for Apple Maps EV Routing.</blockquote>Looking further ahead into the future, Apple confirmed that it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/23/apple-statement-on-next-generation-carplay/\">continues to work with several auto makers on next-generation CarPlay</a>.
