The 2024 Summer Olympic Games mark Liggett’s <em>17th</em> games having covered both Summer and Winter editions. Recently, while on a broadcast for <a href=\"https://www.nineforbrands.com.au/media-release/legendary-cycling-commentator-phil-liggett-announces-he-has-commentated-his-final-olympics/\" target=\"_blank\">Channel Nine’s Wide World of Sports from Australia</a>, Liggett announced that this would be his last coverage of the Olympic games. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liggett will turn 81 years old the day of the closing ceremony, and he states that by the time the next Summer games roll around, he’ll be 85 which he feels is just “too old.” </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div><blockquote><p>Gosh, I I haven't left my desk for two days. All I did was tell C9 Australia that I wouldn't be doing the Olympics in 2028! Thank you so much for your amazing words and stories. However, as Sam Clemens once said: \"Reports of my death are greatly exaggerated!\"Love you all.</p>— Phil Liggett (@PhilLiggett) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PhilLiggett/status/1820832866772697314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 6, 2024</a></blockquote></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While Phil Liggett has announced that he is retiring from Olympic commentary, it does not seem like this is a goodbye to all cycling commentary just yet. Many outlets’ coverage seems to imply that he is retiring for good, but Liggett posted to Twitter today that the “Reports of my death are greatly exaggerated!” We’ve reached out for comment and will report back if we get an official word from Phil. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, chapeau Phil, and thanks for the memories!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cycling-commentating-legend-phil-liggett-announces-this-is-his-last-olympic-games/\">Cycling Commentating Legend Phil Liggett Announces This is His Last Olympic Games</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ef12d112438dd2468305c282357939db9187a14dbcaa51df717f7742c37cc82e","category":"Cycling"}
