{"title":"Apple Subreddit Goes Dark in Protest of Reddit's API Pricing Changes","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/11/apple-subreddit-goes-dark/","date":1686520464000,"content":"Apple-related subreddit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/\">/r/apple</a> has gone dark in protest of Reddit's upcoming <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/\">API pricing changes</a> affecting third-party Reddit apps. The subreddit is now private, meaning that users can no longer view or submit posts, and the moderators behind the community said it will remain that way for the next 48 hours, or potentially longer if necessary.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/General-Apps-Reddit-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\n/r/apple is <a href=\"https://reddark.untone.uk/\">one of many subreddits</a> that will be going dark over the next few days, alongside /r/videos, /r/mildlyinteresting, /r/DIY, and others. The organized blackout comes after Reddit announced expensive API pricing changes that threaten to put some third-party Reddit apps out of business. Christian Selig, developer of popular Reddit app Apollo, said he would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/31/reddit-api-changes-pricing-apollo/\">owe Reddit around $20 million per year</a> under the new policy. As a result, Selig announced that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/08/apollo-shutting-down-june-30/\">Apollo will be shutting down</a> at the end of the month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nReddit's API provides apps like Apollo with Reddit data like posts and comments, and it has been free to use until now. Selig said it is understandable for Reddit to begin charging for access to the API, but the pricing is prohibitively expensive. Selig also said Reddit provided him with minimal time to prepare for the changes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nReddit CEO Steve Huffman <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/\">addressed the topic</a> in a Reddit post last week, but his comments were heavily criticized and received thousands of downvotes from Reddit users. Despite backlash from the community, Reddit has yet to reverse course on its plans so far, and the API changes are set to go into effect on July 1 if upheld.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apollo/\">Apollo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/reddit/\">Reddit</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/11/apple-subreddit-goes-dark/\">Apple Subreddit Goes Dark in Protest of Reddit's API Pricing Changes</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-subreddit-goes-dark-in-protest-of-reddits-api-pricing-changes.2392572/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"03b18ad5e34b56e6f106ecd5652b5822f058e5b72a15c9d1132573b399abab1d","category":"Apple"}
