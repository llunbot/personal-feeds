The launch of the HomePod mini in Denmark today likely rules out a second-generation model of the speaker launching in the near future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple had discontinued the full-size HomePod in 2021, but the company <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-announces-new-homepod/\">introduced a second-generation model</a> in January. The new HomePod features a similar design as the original smart speaker, with a larger backlit touch surface and a few other improvements. Despite having two fewer tweeters, reviews found the new HomePod <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/review/homepod/\">sounds virtually the same as the original</a>, but Siri still has shortcomings compared to other virtual assistants.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks, Kasper!)</em><div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini\">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/04/homepod-launches-in-denmark/\">HomePod Mini Launches in Denmark, Likely Ruling Out New Model in Near Future</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/homepod-mini-launches-in-denmark-likely-ruling-out-new-model-in-near-future.2388690/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"992e287f6f8270d9e881bd502dca01c470774cd3f9617c8e1727786e8299018c","category":"Apple"}
