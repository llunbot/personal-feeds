The discussions are in their early stages, and it is unclear what shape a bundle could take, they said.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe report notes that the discussions between Apple and Paramount come at a time when competitive pressures have seen services increase their prices to bring them to profitability, while also having to deal with customers increasingly canceling subscriptions or switching services.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple in October <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/\">announced</a> that it was increasing the prices of some of its subscription-based services, including ‌Apple TV+‌, which went from $6.99 per month to $9.99 per month, a $3 rise. For those who subscribe to ‌Apple TV+‌ on an annual basis, the price has increased from $69 per year to $99 per year accordingly.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe rationale behind offering multiple services as part of one package is that it is thought to reduce the likelihood that subscribers will cancel on any given month. The strategy has already been put in place by Netflix and Max, which are being bundled together as part of a deal with Verizon.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/01/apple-paramount-bundled-tv-services/\">Apple and Paramount Considering Discounted TV+ Streaming Bundle</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-and-paramount-considering-discounted-tv-streaming-bundle.2412552/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"95e598d1b61720ddda8fc010e486ee036c698f2449a7dddbe35eb79ba81aa013","category":"Apple"}
