Of course, the company also makes speed sensors, heart rate straps, cadence sensors, power meter pedals/sensors, and plenty more.</p>\n<p>But when US customers went to purchase the Wahoo TRACKR Radar today, they found a bit of a surprise: Shipping was $50.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the cheapest shipping option was $50USD, a far cry from the cheapest shipping option on the Wahoo BOLT 3, which was $15. Here’s what the page shows, when a US customer attempts to order the TRACKR Radar:</p>\n<p><img title=\"WahooUS.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/WahooUS.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"718\" height=\"296\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/WahooUS.png 1436w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/WahooUS-200x82.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/WahooUS-720x297.png 720w\" /></p>\n<p>Now, what’s notable here is the same isn’t true for EU customers. In fact, there’s not any shipping charge at all. Simply free shipping:</p>\n<p><img title=\"WahooEURPrices.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/WahooEURPrices.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"298\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/WahooEURPrices.png 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/WahooEURPrices-200x83.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/WahooEURPrices-720x298.png 720w\" /></p>\n<p>So, what’s the difference? Well, given you read the title – it’s the manufacturing location: China.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_4848.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_4848.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_4848.jpeg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_4848-200x150.jpeg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_4848-720x540.jpeg 720w\" /></p>\n<p>The BOLT 3 &amp; ROAM 3, like many of Wahoo’s products, are made in Taiwan. However, the TRACKR Radar is made in China, and thus subject to new US tariffs starting at 145%. While there are creative carveouts limiting tariffs for certain tech products coming from China, notably for phones and smartwatches, such exemptions don’t cover cycling radars.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_4850.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_4850.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_4850.jpeg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_4850-200x150.jpeg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/IMG_4850-720x540.jpeg 720w\" /></p>\n<p>Now, I don’t have a problem per se with Wahoo passing on the cost. After all, like it or not, that’s the reality of the US political landscape right now (because, let’s be clear, this is a political choice). However, what I do have a problem with, is not owning up to it. Instead, Wahoo lists this as a ‘service charge’ within the shipping line item, as you saw above.</p>\n<p>If you click on the details about service charges, it brings <a href=\"https://www.wahoofitness.com/shipping-and-delivery\">you to another page</a> with a heavily wishy-washy statement about global supply chains:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"ServiceCharge.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/ServiceCharge.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"719\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/ServiceCharge.png 1438w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/ServiceCharge-200x74.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/ServiceCharge-720x266.png 720w\" /></p>\n<p>Pretending things are shipping charges isn’t consumer friendly (or honest), and frankly, more importantly – doesn’t actually apply any meaningful pressure to enact change. Further, when Wahoo communicates the price of the Wahoo TRACKR Radar to media outlets (or their own site), it’s listed at $199, when in reality, it’s actually $249. Thus, it’s factually dishonest.</p>\n<p>And look, I get it, Wahoo is in a bind here. They got sideswiped by changing government policy (like thousands of other companies), and need to pass on the stupid-high fees to someone, as they should. I just want them to be honest about it. Other companies have simply increased the base price of the unit (temporarily or otherwise), or, they added a specific tariff line-item. But calling it a shipping charge just isn’t the way to do it.</p>\n<p>In fact, if we look <a href=\"https://rei.pxf.io/raR7VD\">at REI’s listing of the TRACKR RADAR</a>, they simply increased the cost accordingly to show the real price: $250</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rei.pxf.io/raR7VD\"><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"REIPrice.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/REIPrice.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/REIPrice.png 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/REIPrice-200x117.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/05/REIPrice-720x420.png 720w\" /></a></p>\n<p>In any event, don’t worry, soon I’ll release my full in-depth reviews of all these units. The thing is, the TRACKR is a good product thus far in my testing, but, at $249, it’s not very competitive with the options in the market (based on either specs, or actual real-world testing scenarios).</p>\n<p>With that, thanks for reading!</p>","author":"Ray Maker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"9add50c4111489555a58cb5038205354c9b44cbf88223b54d9bb92fcd49db490","category":"Cycling"}
