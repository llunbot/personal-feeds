At the rate it's going, that might happen a little sooner. On Thursday, it announced that it now has 10,000 Rivian electric delivery vans in serviceâ€”<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/07/amazon-has-5000-rivian-ev-delivery-vans-on-the-road/\">up from 5,000 earlier this July</a>.</p>\n<p>Rivian's big order from Amazon <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/amazon-orders-100000-electric-trucks-to-fight-climate-change/\">was placed in 2019</a> as part of the online retailer and web service provider's plan to become carbon-neutral by 2040. Earlier that year, Amazon <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/02/electric-truck-startup-announces-700-million-funding-round-led-by-amazon/\">was an investor</a> in a $700 million financing round for the EV startup, which makes <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/rivians-r1s-is-an-electric-suv-for-those-with-an-adventurous-lifestyle/\">electric SUVs</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/09/rivians-67-500-314-mile-electric-adventure-truck-put-to-the-test/\">pickup trucks</a> in addition to the Amazon electric delivery vans.</p>\n<p>At the time, Jeff Bezos wanted all 100,000 Rivian vans on the road by 2024, but even before the coronavirus pandemic landed in March 2020, that had been revised to 2030. The first Rivian EDVs went into service in 2021.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976843#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976843&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
