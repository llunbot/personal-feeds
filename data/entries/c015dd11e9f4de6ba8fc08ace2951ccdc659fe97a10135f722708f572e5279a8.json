That extra cache isn't always useful, but it <em>does</em> tend to boost game performance, and AMD has marketed the X3D series mostly to PC gamers looking for a processor to pair with high-end GPUs like the GeForce RTX 4090 and Radeon RX 7900 XTX.</p>\n\n<p>The X3D chips all come with compromises, mainly in the form of lower clock speeds and less-flexible overclocking support. But if you mainly care about games, the good news is that the 7800X3D runs them just as well as the more-expensive 7950X3D for less money, and it does so without generating too much heat or using too much power.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928696#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928696&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c015dd11e9f4de6ba8fc08ace2951ccdc659fe97a10135f722708f572e5279a8","category":"Tech"}
