Since its launch, Amazon Q Business has been helping customers tackle the challenges of improving workforce productivity.</p> \n<p>In this post, we have two announcements for Amazon Q Business:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><a href=\"#feat-1\">AI-powered workflow automation in Amazon Q Business (coming soon)</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"#feat-2\">Supports for more than 50 action integrations (generally available)</a></li> \n</ol> \n<p>Let’s get started with these new announcements from Amazon Q Business:</p> \n<p><strong><span>AI-powered workflow automation in Amazon Q Business (coming soon)</span><br /></strong>Organizations handle hundreds, if not thousands, of complex workflows that demand precise, repeatable execution. Automating these workflows has been a time-consuming process, often taking months and requiring specialized expertise. As a result, many potentially valuable business processes remain manual, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities.</p> \n<p>Available soon, Amazon Q Business will have a new capability to simplify the creation and maintenance of complex business workflows.</p> \n<p>With this capability, you only need to describe your desired workﬂow using natural language, upload a standard operating procedure (SOP), or record a video of the process being performed. Amazon Q Business uses generative AI to automatically author a detailed workﬂow plan from your inputs in minutes. Then, with the recommended workﬂow, you can review, test, modify, or approve.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/25/news-2024-qbusiness-announcements-r0.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1418\" height=\"820\" /></p> \n<p>Let’s consider an example of automotive claim processing. This process typically involves manually reading claim emails, reviewing attachments, and creating claims in the system. With the new capability in Amazon Q Business, I can create this workflow more efficiently, reducing the time and complexity typically associated with workflow creation.</p> \n<p>First, I upload the relevant SOP.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/25/news-2024-qbusiness-announcements-r1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2127\" height=\"1230\" /></p> \n<p>During the workflow creation process, Amazon Q Business may ask questions to clarify and gather any additional information needed to complete the workflow design.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/25/news-2024-qbusiness-announcements-r2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2097\" height=\"1200\" /></p> \n<p>Based on the provided inputs, Amazon Q Business generates an initial workﬂow template. As an automation author, I can then customize this workﬂow using a visual drag-and-drop interface and integrate it with supported third-party applications for testing. The workﬂow can include API calls, automatic UI actions, execution logic, AI agents, and human-in-the-loop steps to cater to the unique needs of every business process across a wide range of industries and business functions.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/25/news-2024-qbusiness-announcements-r3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2127\" height=\"1230\" /></p> \n<p>When it’s ﬁnalized, I can publish the workﬂow and conﬁgure it to run either on a schedule or in response to speciﬁc triggers. Once published, I can actively track its performance using a feature-rich monitoring dashboard. This dashboard offers built-in analytics, providing detailed insights into the execution and efficiency of all published workflows.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/29/news-2024-qbusiness-announcements-r5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1224\" height=\"708\" /></p> \n<p>When executing the workflow, Amazon Q Business uses a UI agent trained on thousands of websites and desktop applications to seamlessly navigate changes to page layouts and unexpected pop-up windows in real time. Amazon Q Business includes UI automation, API integrations, and workflow orchestration in a single system, eliminating the need to integrate multiple products and services to create a complete enterprise workflow automation system.</p> \n<p><strong><span>Supports for more than 50 action integrations</span><br /></strong>With Amazon Q Business plugins, you have the flexibility to connect to third-party apps and perform specific tasks related to supported third-party services directly within your web experience chat. These plugins are accessible through Amazon Q Apps, a feature within Amazon Q Business that helps you create AI-powered apps that streamline tasks and boost productivity. Additionally, when workflow automation capabilities launch, you will be able to integrate these plugins directly into your workflows.</p> \n<p>In this announcement, we’re introducing a ready-to-use library of platforms with over 50 action integrations and 11 popular business applications. These business applications include Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty Advance, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and more. </p> \n<p>To get started with the new integrations, access Amazon Q Business through your existing account and explore the new plugins and action integrations.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/14/news-2024-qbusiness-announcements-a0.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3474\" height=\"3892\" /></p> \n<p>With these integrations, you can perform various tasks across multiple applications within the Amazon Q Business web application.</p> \n<p>Let’s say I need to create a new opportunity with Salesforce.
