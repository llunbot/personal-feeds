Similar to Nova Lite and Pro, Premier can process input text, images, and videos (excluding audio). With its advanced capabilities, Nova Premier excels at complex tasks that require deep understanding of context, multistep planning, and precise execution across multiple tools and data sources. With a context length of one million tokens, Nova Premier can process extremely long documents or large code bases.</p> \n<p>With Nova Premier and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/model-distillation/?trk=e61dee65-4ce8-4738-84db-75305c9cd4fe&amp;sc_channel=el\">Amazon Bedrock Model Distillation</a>, you can create highly capable, cost-effective, and low-latency versions of Nova Pro, Lite, and Micro, for your specific needs. For example, we used Nova Premier to distill Nova Pro for complex tool selection and API calling. The distilled Nova Pro had a 20% higher accuracy for API invocations compared to the base model and consistently matched the performance of the teacher, with the speed and cost benefits of Nova Pro.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Amazon Nova Premier benchmark evaluation<br /> </strong></span>We evaluated Nova Premier on a broad range of benchmarks across text intelligence, visual intelligence, and agentic workflows. Nova Premier is the most capable model in the Nova family as measured across 17 benchmarks as shown in the table below.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/04/30/nova-premier-pro-benchmark-evaluations2.png\"><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/04/30/nova-premier-pro-benchmark-evaluations2-538x1024.png\" alt=\"Amazon Nova Premier Benchmark Evaluations\" width=\"538\" height=\"1024\" /></a></p> \n<p>Nova Premier is also comparable to the best non-reasoning models in the industry and is equal or better on approximately half of these benchmarks when compared to other models in the same intelligence tier. Details of these evaluations are in the <a href=\"http://amazon.science/publications/amazon-nova-premier-technical-report-and-model-card\">technical report</a>.</p> \n<p>Nova Premier is also the fastest and the most cost-effective model in Amazon Bedrock for its intelligence tier. For further details and comparison on pricing, please refer to the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/\">Bedrock pricing page</a>.</p> \n<p>Nova Premier can also be used as a teacher model for distillation, which means you can transfer its advanced capabilities for a specific use case into smaller, faster, and more efficient models like Nova Pro, Micro, and Lite for production deployments.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Using Amazon Nova Premier</strong></span><br /> To get started with Nova Premier, you first need to request access to the model in the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock?trk=e61dee65-4ce8-4738-84db-75305c9cd4fe&amp;sc_channel=el\">Amazon Bedrock console</a>. Navigate to <strong>Model access</strong> in the navigation pane, find<strong> Nova Premier</strong>, and toggle access.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/04/28/nova-premier-model-access-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/04/28/nova-premier-model-access-2.png\" alt=\"Console screenshot.\" width=\"1060\" height=\"564\" /></a></p> \n<p>Once you have access, you can use Nova Premier through the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/conversation-inference.html?trk=e61dee65-4ce8-4738-84db-75305c9cd4fe&amp;sc_channel=el\">Amazon Bedrock Converse API</a> providing in input a list of messages from the <code>user</code> and the <code>assistant</code>. Messages can include text, images, and videos. Here’s an example of a straightforward invocation using the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/?trk=e61dee65-4ce8-4738-84db-75305c9cd4fe&amp;sc_channel=el\">AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)</a>:</p> \n<pre><code>import boto3\nimport json\n\nAWS_REGION = \"us-east-1\"\nMODEL_ID = \"us.amazon.nova-premier-v1:0\"\n\nbedrock_runtime = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime', region_name=AWS_REGION)\nmessages = [\n    {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": [\n            {\n                \"text\": \"Explain the differences between vector databases and traditional relational databases for AI applications.\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n\nresponse = bedrock_runtime.converse(\n    modelId=MODEL_ID,\n    messages=messages\n)\n\nresponse_text = response[\"output\"][\"message\"][\"content\"][-1][\"text\"]\n\nprint(response_text)\n</code></pre> \n<p>This example shows how Nova Premier can provide detailed explanations for complex technical questions. But the real power of Premier comes with its ability to handle sophisticated workflows.</p> \n<p><b><u>Multi-agent collaboration use case<br /> </u></b>Let’s explore a more complex scenario that showcases how Nova Premier works a multi-agent collaboration architecture for investment research.</p> \n<p>The equity research process typically involves multiple stages: identifying relevant data sources for specific investments, retrieving required information from those sources, and synthesizing the data into actionable insights. This process becomes increasingly complex when dealing with different types of financial instruments like stock indices, individual equities, and currencies.</p> \n<p>We can build this type of application using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-bedrock-announces-general-availability-of-multi-agent-collaboration/?trk=e61dee65-4ce8-4738-84db-75305c9cd4fe&amp;sc_channel=el\">multi-agent collaboration in Amazon Bedrock</a>, with Nova Premier powering the supervisor agent that orchestrates the entire workflow. The supervisor agent analyzes the initial query (for example, “What are the emerging trends in renewable energy investments?”), breaks it down into logical steps, determines which specialized subagents to engage, and synthesizes the final response.</p> \n<p>For this scenario, I’ve created a system with the following components:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>A supervisor agent powered by Nova Premier</li> \n <li>Multiple specialized subagents powered by Nova Pro, each focusing on different financial data sources</li> \n <li>Tools that connect to financial databases, market analysis tools, and other relevant information sources</li> \n</ol> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/04/16/nova-premier-lauch-post.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/04/16/nova-premier-lauch-post.png\" alt=\"Multi-agent architectural diagram\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\" /></a></p> \n<p>When I submit a query about emerging trends in renewable energy investments, the supervisor agent powered by Nova Premier does the following:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Analyzes the query to determine the underlying topics and sources to cover</li> \n <li>Selects the appropriate subagents specific to those topics and sources</li> \n <li>Each subagent retrieves their relevant economic indicators, technical analysis, and market sentiment data</li> \n <li>The supervisor agent synthesizes this information into a comprehensive report for review by a financial professional</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Utilizing Nova Premier in a multi-agent collaboration architecture such as this streamlines the financial professional’s work and helps them formulate their investment analysis faster. The following video provides a visual description of this scenario.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>The key advantage of using Nova Premier for the supervisor role is its accuracy in coordinating complex workflows, so that the right data sources are consulted in the optimal sequence and each subagent receives in input the correct information for their work, resulting in higher quality insights.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Multi-agent collaboration with model distillation</strong></span><br /> Although Nova Premier provides the highest level of accuracy of its family of models, you might want to optimize latency and cost in production environments. This is where the strength of Nova Premier as a teacher model for distillation becomes interesting.
