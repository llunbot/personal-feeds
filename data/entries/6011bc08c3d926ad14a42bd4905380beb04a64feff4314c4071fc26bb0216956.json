The site claims that Apple has four separate models in the works (two each in cellular and Wi-Fi), though it is not clear what the differentiating factor would be if there are indeed two separate ‌iPad Air‌ models coming.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/ipad-air-cyber.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple makes two versions of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> because it comes in two sizes, and <em>9to5Mac</em> speculates that Apple could release a larger version of the ‌iPad Air‌ to go along with the current 10.9-inch version, or debut \"a more expensive model with better specs.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> lineup already features two sizes of the ‌iPad Pro‌, a low-cost ‌iPad‌, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, a larger or higher-end ‌iPad Air‌ may not make a lot of sense. <em>9to5Mac</em> warns that Apple's plans could change and that a second ‌iPad Air‌ model might not appear.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPrior rumors have suggested that Apple is working on a seventh-generation ‌iPad mini‌ and an 11th-generation low-cost ‌iPad‌, with neither tablet expected to feature major changes. <em>9to5Mac</em> says that its sources believe the ‌iPad mini‌ 7 is coming \"soon,\" but the report also says that all of the new iPads are on track to be announced \"between now and WWDC 2024 in June,\" which is a wide window.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said in September that Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/\">not likely to introduce</a> new iPads in 2023, and that ‌iPad mini‌ and ‌iPad Air‌ models will instead come in 2024. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/09/gurman-october-apple-event-unlikely/\">also said in September</a> that Apple is working on a new ‌iPad Air‌ and that it could be \"coming soonish,\" so it continues to be unclear if we'll see an ‌iPad‌ of some kind before the end of the year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has not refreshed the ‌iPad Air‌ since March of 2022, so it has been over a year since the last update. The current model includes the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip, and Apple could wait for the debut of the M3 chip for an update, so ‌iPad Air‌ launch timing could be tied to M3 launch timing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for the ‌iPad mini‌, it has not been refreshed since September 2021, though it is not a tablet that Apple updates regularly.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/apple-two-ipad-air-models/\">Apple Allegedly Working on Two New iPad Air Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-allegedly-working-on-two-new-ipad-air-models.2406493/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6011bc08c3d926ad14a42bd4905380beb04a64feff4314c4071fc26bb0216956","category":"Apple"}
