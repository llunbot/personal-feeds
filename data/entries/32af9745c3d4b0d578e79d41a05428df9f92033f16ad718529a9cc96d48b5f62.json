The series eschews the usual Star Wars space-battle fare for a quieter, space Western detective story—who is killing the great Jedi masters of the galaxy?—with highly choreographed fight scenes that draw heavily from the martial arts. And like its predecessors, <em>The Acolyte</em> is recognizably Star Wars<em>.</em> Yet it also boasts a unique aesthetic style that is very much its own.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers below for episodes 1 through 5 of <em>The Acolyte</em>.)</strong></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031434#p3\">Read 36 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031434&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"32af9745c3d4b0d578e79d41a05428df9f92033f16ad718529a9cc96d48b5f62","category":"Tech"}
