However, the protective aspect is superficial at best and prevents your MacBook from being scratched by other objects in your bag. The sleeve is more suitable as a very fashionable accessory in nicely-furnished offices.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Price When Reviewed</p>\n<p>This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Best Pricing Today</p>\n\n\n\n</div></div>\n</div><h3>Price When Reviewed</h3><p>$98</p>\n\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\tBest Prices Today: Harber London Classic Leather MacBook Sleeve\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Retailer</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/themes/idg-base-theme/dist/static/img/amazon-logo.svg\" alt=\"Amazon\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$84.13\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGXDL6RR?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Harber London</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$98\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.harberlondon.com/products/classic-leather-macbook-cover-sleeve\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Product</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from Backmarket\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>Harber London is a relatively young family business from London (as the name implies) and specializes in high-quality accessories made from equally high-quality materials: full-grain leather, wool felt, and, more recently, a plastic textile made from recycled plastic bottles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the laptop sleeves, such as the Leather MacBook Sleeve are completely plastic-free.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/harber_london_macbook_sleeve_5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"harber london macbook sleeve 5\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/harber_london_macbook_sleeve_5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/harber_london_macbook_sleeve_5.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/harber_london_macbook_sleeve_5.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/harber_london_macbook_sleeve_5.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/harber_london_macbook_sleeve_5.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/harber_london_macbook_sleeve_5.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/harber_london_macbook_sleeve_5.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Eugen Wegmann</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though it is made of high-quality leather and wool felt, the Leather MacBook Sleeve is quite simple overall. The back half consists of a thin piece of leather, the front of a thicker piece of felt, onto which another piece of thin leather is sewn, which acts as two small pockets. And that’s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sleeve comes in four color options: light grey (Classic) or dark grey felt (Black Edition) combined with black or brown leather. It is also available in different sizes for all possible MacBooks since the MacBook Air from 2010.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/harber_london_macbook_sleeve_4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"harber london macbook sleeve 4\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/harber_london_macbook_sleeve_4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/harber_london_macbook_sleeve_4.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/harber_london_macbook_sleeve_4.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/harber_london_macbook_sleeve_4.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/harber_london_macbook_sleeve_4.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/harber_london_macbook_sleeve_4.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/harber_london_macbook_sleeve_4.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Stability: zero.

Conversely, you should of course not choose the MacBook Air version for your 16-inch MacBook Pro. It simply won’t fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Leather MacBook Sleeve does not have a fastener either. As one long side is permanently open, there is of course practically no (splash) water protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><ul><li><figure><img alt=\"harber london macbook sleeve 2\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/harber_london_macbook_sleeve_2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"harber london macbook sleeve 1\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/harber_london_macbook_sleeve_1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li></ul><a></a><a></a><a></a><div></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The two small pockets on the front are practical for storing cables, notes, and other small items, and even one of the smaller MacBook power adapters fits in quite well. Then it gets pretty cramped. The large 96-watt power supply unit from Apple, which is included with the more powerful MacBook Pro, just about fits, but the plug either hangs out of the bag or presses against the inside of the leather –not ideal in either case. Smaller, but thicker power supply units stretch the pocket quite a bit and wear out the leather in the long run. The two pockets cannot be closed either.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy the Harber London Leather MacBook Sleeve?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Harber London Leather MacBook Sleeve is a high-quality, beautifully finished accessory that offers some protection for your MacBook from scratches and dents. You can carry your MacBook in style from meeting room to meeting room. But if you’re traveling you need something more robust and you’re probably better off with a different sleeve or bag.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4e88a031db5e37d039d39ecd8706f088a3903b65a1ee1aab3bb296332120f3dc","category":"Apple"}
