{"title":"VisionOS 2.4, Now in Beta, Will Add New ‘Spatial Gallery’ App and Support for Apple Intelligence, Along With a ‘Vision Pro’ App for iPhones","link":"https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/02/new-visionos-beta-adds-apple-intelligence-spatial-gallery-ios-apps/","date":1741023182000,"content":"\n<p>Jason Snell, writing last week at Six Colors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While a lot of us have gotten excited about the potential of\nApple’s immersive video format, the truth is that the Vision Pro\nis also a great viewer of more traditional 3-D video content. And\nApple has built a new visionOS app to highlight great spatial\ncontent: Spatial Gallery.</p>\n\n<p>Think of Spatial Gallery as something sort of like the TV app, but\nfor spatial videos, photos, and panoramas. The content comes from\nApple as well as third-party content sources, and Apple is\ncurating it all itself. The company says the content will be\nupdated on a regular basis, and among the demo content I saw\nfeatured was some of 3-D (not immersive) behind-the-scenes content\nfrom various Apple TV+ productions such as “Severance” and\n“Shrinking.”</p>\n\n<p>Just as the Apple Watch has its own app on iOS, so too will the\nVision Pro. The new Vision Pro iOS app will be available with iOS\n18.4, and will automatically appear on the iPhones of people who\nhave Vision Pros. Of course the app will show off new content and\noffer tips, but it’s also functional: If you add highlighted media\ncontent via the app, it’ll be set to download on the Vision Pro.\nSimilarly, you can use the Vision Pro app to remotely download\napps to your Vision Pro, so they’re ready for you when you put the\nheadset on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>VisionOS 2.4 is also making some big improvements to guest mode, making it much easier to let someone else use your Vision Pro. It remains to be seen if Vision is ever going to be a successful platform, but the potential is clearly there, and Apple is definitely <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/this_is_how_apple_rolls\">rolling</a> on it.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/03/visionos-2-4-spatial-gallery-app\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1d9a23b26cdcd568286a6f09d3a183fb93211876b0bd909461a4552ec641480c","category":"Tech"}
