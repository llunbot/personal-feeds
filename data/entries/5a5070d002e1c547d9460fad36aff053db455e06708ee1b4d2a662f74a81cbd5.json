And, you know, a complete frame redesign. The SB115 <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/yeti-sb120-switches-up-xc-with-more-trail-ready-travel-enduro-inspiration/\" target=\"_blank\">became the SB120</a>, with 120mm travel rear and and 130mm fork.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is fine, but Yeti’s backyard trails begged for more. The climbs demanded the shorter travel, more efficient 120mm bike. But the descents required something more aggressive, so they made a few tweaks to create the ultimate lunch ride bike – the SB120LR.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2200\" height=\"1467\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-4.jpg\" alt=\"yeti sb120lr mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-4.jpg 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-4-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-4-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-4-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-4-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-4-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rear shock is replaced with a Rockshox Super Deluxe Ultimate with piggy-back reservoir. The fork is a Rockshox Pike Ultimate with an extra 10mm travel, pushing it to 140mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the recent Yeti mountain bikes have been shipping with Fox suspension, so the switch to Rockshox for this special edition could be a hint of things to come. Brakes upgrade to SRAM Code RSC brakes, with larger 200mm front and 180mm rear rotors.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2200\" height=\"1467\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-3.jpg\" alt=\"yeti sb120lr mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-3.jpg 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-3-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-3-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Yeti SB120 Lunch Ride edition gets a SRAM X0 AXS Transmission drivetrain, Race Face ARC30 wheels, and Maxxis Minion DHF 2.5″ &amp; Aggressor 2.3″ tires, 29er on both ends.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2200\" height=\"1467\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-2.jpg\" alt=\"yeti sb120lr mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-2.jpg 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-2-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-yeti-sb120LR-lunch-ride-edition-trail-mountain-bike-2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Choose from three colors plus raw carbon and the bike is yours for $8,600.
