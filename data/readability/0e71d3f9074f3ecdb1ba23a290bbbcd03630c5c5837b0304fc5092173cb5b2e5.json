This is actually the second iteration of the rather niche yet race-winning rig, hand built in Bristol with the input of suspension experts at TF Tuned.</p><p>The idea behind the original Sturn was to create a high-pivot downhill bike that suffers zero chain growth as it is pushed through its travel; a chain idler is the most commonly seen answer to that problem, but Starling are of the opinion that a Jack Shaft is the lower friction solution to reducing chain forces. After selling just a handful, founder Joe McEwan decided he wasn’t quite satisfied that the bike was everything it could be, so set to work updating almost everything, from the pivot location, to the Jack Shaft solution, making geometry compatible with a mixed-wheel setup along the way Here’s more.&nbsp;</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0BTlv0VE7Lc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><h2>Starling Sturn V2</h2><div id=\"attachment_280395\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101212/starling-sturn-downhill-single-speed-bike-jack-shaft-v1-versus-v2.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-280395\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101212/starling-sturn-downhill-single-speed-bike-jack-shaft-v1-versus-v2.jpg\" alt=\"starling sturn v1 versus v2\" width=\"1600\" height=\"551\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101212/starling-sturn-downhill-single-speed-bike-jack-shaft-v1-versus-v2.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101212/starling-sturn-downhill-single-speed-bike-jack-shaft-v1-versus-v2-297x102.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101212/starling-sturn-downhill-single-speed-bike-jack-shaft-v1-versus-v2-800x276.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101212/starling-sturn-downhill-single-speed-bike-jack-shaft-v1-versus-v2-120x41.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101212/starling-sturn-downhill-single-speed-bike-jack-shaft-v1-versus-v2-768x264.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101212/starling-sturn-downhill-single-speed-bike-jack-shaft-v1-versus-v2-1536x529.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-280395\">Left; Starling Sturn V2 Jack Shaft, Right; Starling Sturn V1 – Note significant revisions to the swingarm, particularly at the yoke region</p></div><p>Joe McEwan, founder of Starling Cycles, maintains the Sturn V1 always worked very well, but that the Jackshaft and chain tensioning solutions weren’t quite as refined as he would’ve like.

That results in a majority rearward axle path, resulting in an effective rear centre length that grows, rather than shortens, as the bike is pushed through its rear wheel travel. To be more specific, on a 27.5″ swingarm, the rear wheel goes through 123mm of its 200mm travel before the rear axle starts tracking a forward path.</p><div id=\"attachment_280386\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101153/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-V2-Downhill-Bike-005.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-280386\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101153/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-V2-Downhill-Bike-005.jpg\" alt=\"starling sturn single pivot single speed jackshaft dh mtb\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1070\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101153/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-V2-Downhill-Bike-005.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101153/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-V2-Downhill-Bike-005-297x199.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101153/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-V2-Downhill-Bike-005-800x535.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101153/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-V2-Downhill-Bike-005-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101153/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-V2-Downhill-Bike-005-768x514.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101153/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-V2-Downhill-Bike-005-1536x1027.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-280386\">Joe says a second benefit of the Jack Shaft design is that the main pivot bearings are constantly moving, so don’t become “notchy”</p></div><p>Key to the design is that the Jack Shaft naturally places the chains concentric to the main pivot location, meaning the chain length remains the same, no matter where the rear wheel is at any point throughout its travel. So, chain growth is eliminated, but it does leave a slight issue in that the chain line is now offset from the main pivot. Joe says pedaling forces do therefore affect suspension a little, but running a small Jack Drive sprocket reduces this.</p><p>Joe says the Sturn has <em>“suspension that feels absolutely sublime. It tracks super rough terrain, it absorbs impacts beautifully and it carries speed like nothing you’ve ever ridden”.</em></p><div id=\"attachment_280393\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101208/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-V2-Downhill-Bike-039.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-280393\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101208/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-V2-Downhill-Bike-039.jpg\" alt=\"starling sturn v2 varius upper shock mount locations\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101208/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-V2-Downhill-Bike-039.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101208/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-V2-Downhill-Bike-039-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101208/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-V2-Downhill-Bike-039-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101208/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-V2-Downhill-Bike-039-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101208/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-V2-Downhill-Bike-039-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08101208/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-V2-Downhill-Bike-039-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-280393\">The Starling Sturn V2 maintains the shock mount position adjustability, allowing the rider to play around with different stroke lengths and bottom brackets heights.</p></div><p>What about geometry?</p><p>Well, there are no standard frame sizes for the Sturn, nor is there a standard wheel size configuration.
