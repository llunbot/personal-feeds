{"title":"From Competitive Sailing to eBikes: Stromer ST7 Alinghi Red Bull Racing Limited Edition","link":"https://bikerumor.com/competitive-sailing-ebikes-stromer-st7-alinghi-red-bull-racing-limited-edition/","date":1686580414000,"content":"<p>Red Bull Racing may immediately bring F1 racing to mind, but Red Bull sponsors a number of different power sports – or in this case, wind sports. As the official ebike partner of the competitive sailing Alinghi Red Bull Racing Team, Stromer has released this limited edition ST7 ebike in the team’s colors. With only 350 of these bikes to be made, this is a pricey limited edition toy for those who can afford it; but for your money, you do get some of Stromer’s best technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ST7 ARBR edition boasts Stromer’s most powerful motor and battery (offering a 110-mile maximum range), an electronically shifted Pinion 12-speed gearbox, a Gates carbon drive belt, and Blubrake’s ABS system on the front brake.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stromer ST7 Alinghi Red Bull Racing:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stromer-ST7-ARBR-front-angle.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stromer-ST7-ARBR-front-angle-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stromer-ST7-ARBR-front-angle-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stromer-ST7-ARBR-front-angle-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stromer-ST7-ARBR-front-angle-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stromer-ST7-ARBR-front-angle-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stromer-ST7-ARBR-front-angle-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stromer-ST7-ARBR-front-angle.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The ST7 ARBR edition is built on Stromer’s aluminum Sports frame, which will be available in three sizes (M/L/XL) and is covered by a ten year warranty.
