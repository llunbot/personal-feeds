He stopped short of mentioning Xiaomi's aim to become the world's biggest smartphone vendor, a goal he first mentioned in August 2021. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nLei often attempts to characterize Xiaomi as a major rival to Apple, but the company's $300 billion market capitalization pales in comparison to Apple's almost $3 trillion valuation. Nevertheless, in the second quarter of 2021, Apple's ‌iPhone‌ sales were briefly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/15/xiaomi-apple-smartphone-shipments-q2-2021/\">surpassed by Xiaomi for the first time</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nXiaomi is actively aiming to capture the global high-end smartphone segment. Last year, Lei described competition with Apple as \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/11/xiaomi-pledges-war-of-life-and-death-against-apple/\">a war of life and death</a>.\" Xiaomi reportedly intends to attract more customers by distinguishing itself from other major Chinese Android smartphone brands that are also targeting Apple's lucrative high-end segment by focusing on user experience, as well as filling the void left by the likes of Huawei.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 features an 8-inch AMOLED display, a 5x periscopic zoom camera, Leica optics, Qualcomm's second-generation Snapdragon processor, and 50W wireless charging. It starts at $1,240 and is currently available in China only.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/xiaomi/\">Xiaomi</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/xiaomi-plans-to-catch-up-and-beat-the-iphone/\">Xiaomi Plans to 'Catch Up and Beat' the iPhone Following Mix Fold 3 Announcement</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/xiaomi-plans-to-catch-up-and-beat-the-iphone-following-mix-fold-3-announcement.2398695/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b732d6c84255f6a24a6f8ddeb717865c1165473495b0f4277125ae7f9b2d6e76","category":"Apple"}
