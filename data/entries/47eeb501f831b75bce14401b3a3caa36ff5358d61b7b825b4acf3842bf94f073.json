Users simply need to hold their ‌iPhone‌ or Apple Watch near the contactless payment reader until a checkmark appears on the display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTransport for NSW undertook a staggered rollout of Express Mode across the 25,000 card readers on the Opal network, starting with ferries and light rail, then train stations, and then the thousands of Opal readers on buses, which finished this week.\r<br />\n<blockquote>\"Commuters in the Hunter, Illawarra, Blue Mountains and everywhere in between will benefit from being the first public transport users in Australia to benefit from the mass roll out of this initiative,\" said NSW transport minister Jo Haylen. \"It will make life so much easier for the almost two million transport passengers who use contactless payments with a digital wallet in NSW.\"</blockquote><h2>How to Set Up Express Transit on iPhone</h2>\r<br />\n<ol><li>Launch the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your ‌iPhone‌.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap <strong>Wallet &amp; Apple Pay</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap <strong>Express Transit Card</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap one of your cards in the list to use it with Express Transit.
