But I’d sure like to see what exactly that letter says. The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521\">PAFACA Act</a> — the law that bans TikTok in the US now that the deadline has passed for ByteDance to sell it to a US company — hasn’t changed or been rescinded, and the current delay in enforcement <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/npr_trump_tiktok\">has no basis in law</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Also, still no idea how this is going to end, because I really don’t think the CCP is going to allow ByteDance to sell TikTok.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/13/apple-google-tiktok-app-stores\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4e0ff6d69458649536a5aea091acaaec7fb4e31e858e51f3b989b4b6cb0b6a60","category":"Tech"}
