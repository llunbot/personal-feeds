The update furthers Microsoft's crusade to tuck generative AI into all of its products, though, as usual, it makes a ton of smaller iterative changes to the OS and its apps.</p>\n<p>Microsoft says these new features \"start becoming available September 26,\" which could mean that some are available on that day and others are available later. It could also be a reference to Microsoft's standard practice of rolling major Windows updates out to smaller groups of users first, checking for problems, and expanding the rollout to larger groups afterward.</p>\n<p>Curiously, Microsoft says this version of Windows will still be called \"22H2,\" where we'd normally expect it to be released as the 23H2 update. Microsoft hasn't formally announced any changes to its \"<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows11-release-information\">annual feature update cadence</a>,\" though these days, it seems to run counter to the company's \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/microsoft-commits-to-updating-windows-11-once-per-year-and-also-all-the-time/#:~:text=Microsoft%20commits%20to%20updating%20Windows,all%20the%20time%20%7C%20Ars%20Technica\">release new features whenever they're ready and we feel like doing it</a>\" policy.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970005#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970005&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b11b9ed86272f67c60deb0af91dce9f542ed49d31a03de575da361bd91883dc1","category":"Tech"}
