The update will include three core features: hearing protection, hearing testing, and hearing aid functionality. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/12/airpods-pro-2-hearing-aid-fda-authorization/\">obtained FDA authorization</a> for the new features last month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOne of the key components of the update is the ability to conduct a hearing test directly from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>. The test works by playing a series of tones across different frequencies and prompting users to respond, much like a clinical hearing test performed by audiologists. The results are stored in the Health app, and users can adjust their AirPods' audio settings accordingly. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf the test indicates hearing loss, the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 can automatically configure themselves to act as hearing aids, boosting specific sounds in real time. As Apple's Vice President of Health, Dr. Sumbul Desai, explained during Apple's event announcing the feature: \"After you take a hearing test, your ‌AirPods Pro‌ are transformed into a personalized hearing aid, boosting the specific sounds you need in real time, like parts of speech, or elements within your environment.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe update also introduces enhanced hearing protection. The feature will continuously monitor the user's environment and reduce the impact of loud sounds, such as traffic or concerts, in real time. This function will be integrated across various listening modes, including noise cancellation and transparency mode.
