This connection increases comfort and efficiency by keeping the seat pad, or chamois, stable and aligned beneath you, helping to prevent it from bunching up by migrating sideways or forward. They also provide more support, as the straps leverage your upper body’s forward posture to keep your shorts snug and better contoured to your body. The lack of a defined waistband also helps keep unwanted pressure off your abdomen, which can cause discomfort over time. As odd as they may look before being covered by your jersey, bib shorts are ubiquitous in racing for the benefits mentioned above, and once you try them, you’re unlikely to return to regular padded shorts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all cycling bib shorts are created equal, however, with different materials, designs, straps, pads, and a wide range of price points to choose from. With so many brands and models on the market, finding the right pair for your needs and budget can be a daunting task.

The fabric used by Velocio – a blend of 63% Polyamide and 37% Elastane – dubbed “LUXE”, perfectly balances supple stretch with support and compression. The straps are seamless and utilize a crossing arrangement, forming an “X” across your back, keeping the shorts perfectly positioned over your longest rides. The leg openings are raw cut to prevent chafing and allow freedom of movement in the quads and hamstring muscles. The proprietary “Signature” chamois, developed with Cytech, is dense and supple, providing excellent breathability without a hint of friction anywhere. The LUXE is without fault and is a stellar choice for any challenging ride or tour. </p><p></p><p>The fit of the LUXE is, well, ridiculously luxurious. With minimal seams, there are no puckering, bunching or irritating sections of material at all. The length of both the straps and legs is perfect, giving just enough stretch to stand comfortably, and covering just the right amount of the quadriceps muscles with an exceptional and supportive fit around the glutes. Unlike many premium bib shorts, the LUXE is not highly articulated to the riding position. So, they are perfectly comfortable when standing up, either out of the saddle or off the bike. </p><p></p><p>Velocio’s aesthetic is minimal and stylish. Two tiny logos are the only branding on these bib shorts, and the LUXE will pair well with jerseys from any brand. The LUXE is offered in seven subtle colors which is great since you might end up wanting multiple pairs of these. They’re so good, in fact, that you may end up retiring a few pairs of your old shorts once you try them. </p><p></p><p>The LUXE fabric is special. It instantly feels like a second skin from the moment you put them on, with just the right balance of compression and stretch. The fabric also manages moisture and temperature incredibly well. On a memorable test ride along the Blue Ridge Parkway (BRP) in North Carolina, temperatures were all over the place. This ride entailed climbing up steep slopes out of Asheville in balmy conditions at the start, into a wintry mix of fog and wind along the upper sections of the BRP, near Mount Mitchell, with a long descent back down. Despite varying temperatures and conditions, the LUXE fabric helped maintain a perfect temperature and effectively controlled moisture throughout the entire ride. </p><p></p><p>At $279, the <a href=\"https://velocio.cc/collections/mens-bibs-shorts-tights/products/mens-luxe-bib-short?variant=40521369452617\">Velocio LUXE</a> are certainly expensive bib shorts, but they are more reasonable than some high-end offerings from other brands. After testing them rigorously and having a great experience with them, we feel they are a good value, even at a high price point. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://velocio.cc/collections/mens-bibs-shorts-tights/products/mens-luxe-bib-short?variant=40521369452617\">Check Price at Velocio</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Velocio-Luxe-Cycling-bib-shorts-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Velocio-Luxe-Cycling-bib-shorts-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Velocio Luxe cycling bib shorts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Velocio-Luxe-Cycling-bib-shorts-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Velocio-Luxe-Cycling-bib-shorts-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Velocio-Luxe-Cycling-bib-shorts-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Velocio-Luxe-Cycling-bib-shorts-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Velocio-Luxe-Cycling-bib-shorts-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Velocio-Luxe-Cycling-bib-shorts-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Velocio-Luxe-Cycling-bib-shorts-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Velocio-Luxe-Cycling-bib-shorts-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption> The Velocio LUXE bibs rose to the top of a competitive selection of the best models on the market.

At $100, they are a value-packed option from a company that’s been producing quality cycling apparel and bib shorts for decades. </p><p></p><p>Leveraging its track record of producing great bib shorts, Pearl Izumi was able to transfer many features and design elements of their most expensive bib shorts into the entry-level Attack. Reduced paneling and seams and using raw-edge bib straps promises enhanced comfort along the legs and torso. Pearl Izumi’s excellent <em>Escape 1:1 Chamois</em> pad provides optimal moisture transfer and breathability.</p><p></p><p>Given the lower price point, we found the fit of the Attack to be impressive, especially when compared to bib shorts that cost almost triple the price. The leg length of 10.5” is perfect, and the compression of the <em>Select Transfer</em> fabric is up there with the best bibs tested. The straps are also well-designed, staying flat against the shoulders and never bunching or irritating the skin.

The seamless fit, combined with a custom Elastic Interface® Space chamois ensures total comfort in any riding position, over any distance. </p><p></p><p>The Elastic Interface® Space chamois is brilliant, delivering a dense and supple perch on the saddle. A wide central channel helps maintain good blood flow throughout the longest rides. Equally impressive is the positioning of the chamois, inside a floating pocket of material that runs from front to back, cradling the chamois and isolating it from the rest of the bib shorts. The benefit is that the chamois can move subtly with the rider’s body, without causing the shorts to drift across the saddle. The design works as intended, allowing for confident, stable moves from the tops to the drops and back again. </p><p></p><p>The legs are raw cut and finished with printed silicone grippers, giving the MK3 a perfect fit around the quadriceps and hamstrings. The MK3’s Oeko-Tex® Standard 100 certified fabric has a subtle texture that provides a perfect dose of friction to keep the chamois perfectly in place on the saddle during even the most intense seated efforts.</p><p></p><p>The overall fit provides great compression and support, without feeling overly tight or stretchy. You won’t struggle to get the MK3 on, but once they are on, they feel snug and secure everywhere. Leg length is longer than average, but not so long that gaps form around the leg openings. The straps are seamless and 45mm wide, with an intersection at the mid-back at a softly brushed junction panel before transitioning to a single strap. The straps are delightfully comfortable in any riding position and keep the shorts and chamois situated perfectly. </p><p></p><p>Aesthetically, the MK3 is clean and minimal, in keeping with the understated vibe of the brand’s product offerings. Very little stitching is visible, and just one small logo adorns the right leg. The MK3 is available in three colors, including black, navy, and peat. </p><p></p><p>7Mesh uses only certified sustainable fabrics which meet Bluesign® standards for worker safety and environmental responsibility. It’s great to see that a product that performs this well can be produced ethically. 7Mesh also offers a generous crash replacement and repair policy, so you can ride the MK3 as hard as you want, knowing that they will take care of your bibs if something unforeseen should happen.</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingcyclingbibshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2F7mesh-industries-mk3-bib-short-mens\">7Mesh MK3</a> sells for $200 US.

Having plenty of experience with its predecessors, the first impression of the latest <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingcyclingbibshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fcastelli-free-aero-rc-bib-short-mens\">Castelli Free Aero Race RC</a> was excellent and only improved over the course of many test rides.</p><p></p><p>The pad, which Castelli calls Progetto X2 Air, feels dense but airy, and has the perfect amount of loft to it, like a firm and supportive mattress. There is a subtle structure to the Progetto X2 Air, which allows it to mute unwanted feedback from road bumps transmitted through the saddle, while never feeling bulky or restrictive of the pedal stroke. The pad’s structure also helps it remain flush against the body, never separating during out-of-saddle efforts, or shifting laterally while seated, helping you stay squared up and perfectly level on the saddle. Further enhancing rider stability is the ribbed texture of the fabric on the underside of the pad area. The ribs run perpendicular to the bike’s top tube, which will help limit some riders’ tendency to slide forward during intense seated efforts or when accessing the drops. </p><p></p><p>The legs terminate at raw-cut edges with no stitching or silicone grippers like those you’ll find on most bib shorts. The leg opening is noticeably smaller than average, and the material in this bottom portion of the leg is super flexible yet substantial enough to firmly grab onto the quadriceps muscles. Introduce a little perspiration and the legs stay perfectly glued in place, with a light, comfortable, seamless feeling. </p><p></p><p>Castelli has switched from heat-transfer logos to a handsome rubber medallion that is stitched into the shorts. Not only will the stitched medallion not peel, but it adds to the perceived quality of the bib shorts, signaling that the Free Aero RC is not meant to be pitched out at the end of the race calendar, and instead will stand up to years of heavy use.</p><p></p><p>The back and top sections of the straps, which sit on the rider’s scapular region, are bonded and reinforced, giving a feel that is pleasingly stable and flat. The reinforcement also ensures that the back of the bibs and the Progetto pad does not slide down and forward while riding. Meanwhile, at the front of the straps, the reinforcement is removed and the straps are semi-transparent. This yields a super-flexible zone to help the straps expand freely while putting the bibs on and also makes the front of the straps more comfortable in the hottest conditions when no base layer is being used. </p><p></p><p>The fit of the Free Aero RC is race-oriented. The legs are cut slightly longer than average to cover and smooth airflow across the quadriceps and also offer greater support to these muscles. The Free Aero RC is significantly articulated for an aggressive riding position. Some will not find these to be the most comfortable bibs when standing upright. When seated on the bike, however, the cycling posture transforms the fit into a second skin. </p><p></p><p>If going fast in comfort and style is your priority, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingcyclingbibshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fcastelli-free-aero-rc-bib-short-mens\">Castelli Free Aero RC</a> is worth a serious look. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingcyclingbibshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fcastelli-free-aero-rc-bib-short-mens\">Check Price at Backcountry</a><a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbgapparelcyclingcyclingbibshorts&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FCastelli-Free-Aero-RC-Bibshort\">Check Price at Jenson USA</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Castelli-Free-Aero-RC-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1708\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Castelli-Free-Aero-RC-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Castelli Free Aero RC cycling bib shorts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Castelli-Free-Aero-RC-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Castelli-Free-Aero-RC-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Castelli-Free-Aero-RC-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Castelli-Free-Aero-RC-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Castelli-Free-Aero-RC-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Castelli-Free-Aero-RC-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Castelli-Free-Aero-RC-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Castelli-Free-Aero-RC-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Castelli’s Free Aero RC bibs have a race-oriented fit and performance.

The objectives Castelli set for the Endurance 3 were exceptional seated comfort and moisture control, along with a great fit. </p><p></p><p>While the Endurance 3 achieved the first two objectives, its fit wasn’t especially impressive relative to the best bib shorts out there. This is simply due to the relatively high prevalence of seams in a traditionally constructed bib short like the Endurance 3. More seams give rise to more puckering and bunching of the fabric, especially around the medial glute area. This is something that Castelli understands, and it’s on display in the Free Aero Race RC, which costs a bit more but uses a more advanced fabric that requires much less stitching and fits much better in the legs and glute area than the Endurance 3. </p><p></p><p>All that said, the Endurance is a great choice for long rides, especially in warm conditions. Castelli’s Endurance Evolution fabric stays dry and cool, and there is no better pad than the Progetto X2 Air Seamless. The traditional mesh straps articulate well around the torso without pinching or grabbing. While straps have evolved beyond traditional mesh in higher-end bibs, these mesh straps are without any fuss or issues. </p><p></p><p>Castelli did not use traditional silicone grippers on the leg openings of the Endurance 3, opting instead for its Giro3 gripper, which is very comfortable because it relies on compression, not surface friction, to hold the legs of the Endurance 3 perfectly in place. It’s worth noting that this is a somewhat delicate design, and may lose effectiveness if the Endurance 3 are machine dried repeatedly. </p><p></p><p>Another small niggle with the Endurance 3, and most Castelli cycling shorts, for that matter, is the heat-transferred logos, which can peel and look a bit sad after about one season. Thankfully, Castelli has moved to a stitched rubber medallion logo on some of their more expensive models which helps enhance perceived quality and longevity. </p><p></p><p>At $160, the performance of the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingcyclingbibshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fcastelli-endurance-2-bib-short-mens\">Castelli Endurance 3</a> makes them a great value.

The goal of The Black Bibs is to compete with more expensive bib shorts but at a much lower price point. The <a href=\"https://theblackbibs.com/collections/mens-bibs/products/the-black-bibs-ultimate\">Black Bibs Ultimate</a> is their top-tier option coming in at $80 US, which is double the cost of The Black Bibs Original offering. </p><p></p><p>The brand’s mission statement holds that quality cycling kit has become prohibitively expensive and that by doing away with labels and other “B.S”, The Black Bibs will allow more riders to enjoy cycling, regardless of their budget. This approach is certainly commendable, but we don’t necessarily see these shorts as only for people who can’t afford something better. But it’s worth considering that $80 actually sounds about right for a foam pad sewn into a pair of lycra shorts, whether you’re a college freshman who just discovered road riding or a retired physician who rides 15 hours a week.</p><p></p><p>Still, it’s fair to ask what is missing from these $80 bib shorts, compared with options for a pair costing 3x as much. To understand the difference, you’d need to test ride or at least hold both types of bibs side-by-side. The Velocio Luxe, for instance, uses more refined materials which in turn facilitate more advanced design, and feature a more luxurious and expensive pad. The Black Bibs Ultimate, on the other hand, uses proven, albeit less exotic fabric, which requires a more traditional design that incorporates significantly more stitching. Essentially, these bibs are as good as anything was 20 years ago, but not as good as the best bibs being developed nowadays. </p><p></p><p>Getting into the specifics, The Black Bibs Ultimate is made using 80% polyester and 20% spandex. The pad is sourced from DR Pad, based in Italy, and is triple density 80-95-120 kg/m3. Thickness is from 2-15mm, and a carbon antistatic layer is applied for increased comfort. The straps are a simple mesh, and the bands at the leg openings are silicone-infused to provide a gentle grip. The fit is good, considering that the fabric is not heavily articulated or especially supple, therefore requiring more stitching, which results in some slight puckering and bunching along the seams. </p><p></p><p>The somewhat slippery fabric and positioning of the pad create a tendency to slip forward on the saddle, requiring occasional shifting of the body for maximum comfort. For this reason, these wouldn’t be our first pick for racing, as this would be at best a distraction, and at worst could compromise your ability to ride powerfully in a super-aggressive position for sustained periods. </p><p></p><p>Cycling has enough status symbols and bib shorts don’t need to be another one. The Black Bibs deserve credit for offering a product with zero branding. It seems weird to pay for something, and then be a rolling billboard for that product every time you leave the house. Instead of logos, The Black Bibs offer a nice palette of colors, as well as tall and short inseam lengths, long strap options, and two less expensive models with the original bibs ($40) and Plus bibs ($65), as well as the Adventure bibs ($85) with back and thigh pockets.</p><p></p><p>If you are looking to ride more and spend less, and aren’t concerned with brand names, The <a href=\"https://theblackbibs.com/collections/mens-bibs/products/the-black-bibs-ultimate\">Black Bibs Ultimate</a> are a great pick.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://theblackbibs.com/collections/mens-bibs/products/the-black-bibs-ultimate\">Check Price at the Black Bibs</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Black-Bibs-Ultimate-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1708\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Black-Bibs-Ultimate-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"The Black Bibs Ultimate cycling bib shorts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Black-Bibs-Ultimate-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Black-Bibs-Ultimate-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Black-Bibs-Ultimate-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Black-Bibs-Ultimate-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Black-Bibs-Ultimate-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Black-Bibs-Ultimate-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Black-Bibs-Ultimate-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Black-Bibs-Ultimate-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The affordable Black Bibs Ultimate bib shorts perform very well for the price.

The CONCEPT is Velocio’s race-focused offering, promising improved pedaling motion, a highly compressive fit, and aerodynamically-optimized performance. </p><p></p><p>The race-oriented fit of these bibs is clear from the moment they’re put on. The fabric is highly compressive, and the straps feel short when standing upright. Once you’re on the bike, the CONCEPT feels more natural and comfortable, but if you’re on the cusp of sizes, we’d recommend going up, not down. One small critique of the fit is the leg length. For a bib short aimed at aero gains, the legs are fairly short. Covering more of the quadriceps muscles likely would have made the CONCEPT more aerodynamic than the ribbed material on the outer legs, chosen for its aero performance. </p><p></p><p>Improved pedaling motion comes by way of a custom-designed fully integrated chamois pad that floats inside a fabric pocket, with only a small amount of stitching at the front and rear to anchor the pad in place. The pad is also rather small, providing excellent support and cushioning and support where it is needed, without any bulk due to excess material. While it is hard to say if pedaling in the CONCEPT bibs felt noticeably different or better compared to other high-end bibs, it certainly felt stable and fluid. </p><p></p><p>Overall, the CONCEPT is a great pair of cycling bib shorts, but they were bested in the comfort department by Velocio’s own LUXE model. That said, if aero gains and supreme muscle compression are your priorities, the <a href=\"https://velocio.cc/collections/mens-bibs-shorts-tights/products/mens-concept-bib-short?variant=40321439662153\">Velocio CONCEPT</a> is certainly worth a look. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://velocio.cc/collections/mens-bibs-shorts-tights/products/mens-concept-bib-short?variant=40321439662153\">Check Price at Velocio</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://us.endurasport.com/pro-sl-egm-bibshort-green/14267906.html\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEndura Pro SL EGM Bib Short\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$230</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Fabric</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>78% nylon, 22% elastane</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Pad</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>800 Series Conform EGM Pad</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available colors</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black, Deep Teal, Ink Blue</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://us.endurasport.com/pro-sl-egm-bibshort-green/14267906.html\">\n\n<img width=\"2199\" height=\"1466\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Endura-Pro-SL-EGM-Bib-Short.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Cycling Bib Shorts of 2023\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Endura-Pro-SL-EGM-Bib-Short.jpeg 2199w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Endura-Pro-SL-EGM-Bib-Short-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Endura-Pro-SL-EGM-Bib-Short-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Endura-Pro-SL-EGM-Bib-Short-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Endura-Pro-SL-EGM-Bib-Short-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Endura-Pro-SL-EGM-Bib-Short-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Endura-Pro-SL-EGM-Bib-Short-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Endura-Pro-SL-EGM-Bib-Short-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Exceptional seated comfort</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Wonderful fit and support</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>2 leg length options</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>90 day satisfaction guarantee</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Branding unattractive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p><a href=\"https://us.endurasport.com/pro-sl-egm-bibshort-green/14267906.html\">Endura’s Pro SL EGM</a> Bib Short is designed to bring blissful comfort to your longest rides.

The partnership is working, and these bibs are solid proof. The PRO SL EGM, gave zero pressure points or irritation, and the seated comfort only got better the longer the test rides went. The lumbar support panel also works to give the pad a wonderfully stable feel. </p><p></p><p>At $230 US, the Endura Pro SL EGM presents a more affordable option than many similar bibs costing $50+ more. The <a href=\"https://us.endurasport.com/pro-sl-egm-bibshort-green/14267906.html\">Endura PRO SL EGM</a> is also available in regular and long lengths to dial in the fit to your needs, along with three color options to suit your preference. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://us.endurasport.com/pro-sl-egm-bibshort-green/14267906.html\">Check Price at Endura</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingcyclingbibshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F188144%2Frapha-pro-team-training-cycling-bib-shorts-mens\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRapha Pro Team Training Bib Short\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$210</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Fabric</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Fabric:  74% Recycled Elastane, 26% Nylon</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Pad</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Pro Team Training chamois</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available colors</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black, Dark Navy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL, XXL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingcyclingbibshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F188144%2Frapha-pro-team-training-cycling-bib-shorts-mens\">\n\n<img width=\"2288\" height=\"1525\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rapha-Pro-Team-Training-Bib-Short.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Cycling Bib Shorts of 2023\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rapha-Pro-Team-Training-Bib-Short.jpeg 2288w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rapha-Pro-Team-Training-Bib-Short-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rapha-Pro-Team-Training-Bib-Short-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rapha-Pro-Team-Training-Bib-Short-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rapha-Pro-Team-Training-Bib-Short-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rapha-Pro-Team-Training-Bib-Short-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rapha-Pro-Team-Training-Bib-Short-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rapha-Pro-Team-Training-Bib-Short-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Excellent pad comfort</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Great fit</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Adaptable to a wide range of temperatures</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Moderately expensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>While Rapha’s best-known bib short is the Classic II, the Pro Team line is arguably its more advanced offering. Adopting a more race-inspired fit and design, while retaining the comfort and coming in $50 US less than the Classic II, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingcyclingbibshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F188144%2Frapha-pro-team-training-cycling-bib-shorts-mens\">Rapha Pro Team Training</a> is a compelling option for both racers and avid recreational cyclists.</p><p></p><p>Rapha’s Pro Team line is bifurcated into racing kit that is focused on aerodynamic gains, and training kit that’s designed for pouring on big miles day after day. So, it’s not surprising that the Pro Team Training bib shorts are supportive and luxurious. The fabric is lightweight but fairly dense, and adapts to a wide range of temperatures, so you can head out early in the morning and ride comfortably into the heat of midday. </p><p></p><p>The chamois pad is size-specific and has a very structured, dense, supportive feel. As the miles pass, the pad becomes more comfortable and compliant. While it doesn’t match the seamless feel of the Velocio Luxe or the stability of the 7Mesh MK3, the comfort is excellent considering the fabric and construction of the Pro Team are more traditional. On that note, the Pro Team Training bib shorts use plenty of stitching and paneling. Happily, this does not result in any bunching, pinching, or loose-fitting sections. </p><p></p><p>The fit is compressive but not overly tight, which makes sense for bib shorts that are going to be used for very long rides on successive days. The white straps are a nice touch since they stay invisible beneath lighter-colored jerseys. Most importantly, they are comfortably stretchy and soft, whether paired with a base layer or worn directly against the skin. Leg length is traditional, a bit shorter than many contemporary bib shorts. Thankfully, the Pro Team Traning is available in a long length for taller riders. </p><p></p><p>For knocking out big training rides in style and comfort, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingcyclingbibshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F188144%2Frapha-pro-team-training-cycling-bib-shorts-mens\">Rapha Pro Team Training Bib Shorts</a> are a solid choice. At $210, these are expensive, but still considerably less than many other high-end options. If you’ve always been curious about Rapha bib shorts, these would be an excellent introduction, as they balance all the best aspects of Rapha fit, comfort, and style. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingcyclingbibshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F188144%2Frapha-pro-team-training-cycling-bib-shorts-mens\">Check Price at REI</a><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18518&amp;awinaffid=723761&amp;campaign=&amp;clickref=brbgapparelcyclingcyclingbibshorts&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fshop%2Fmens-pro-team-training-bib-shorts%2Fproduct%2FJIB05RG&amp;platform=pl\">Check Price at Rapha</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingcyclingbibshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fcastelli-competizione-bib-short-mens\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCastelli Competizione Bib Short\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$140</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Fabric</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Affinity Pro Lycra, Vortex BLC textured</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Pad</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>KISS Air2 seat pad</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available colors</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black, Dark Gray, Forest Gray, Deep Green, Saville Blue, Belgian Blue</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL, XXXL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingcyclingbibshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fcastelli-competizione-bib-short-mens\">\n\n<img width=\"1406\" height=\"937\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Castelli-Competizione-Bib-Short.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Cycling Bib Shorts of 2023\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Castelli-Competizione-Bib-Short.jpeg 1406w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Castelli-Competizione-Bib-Short-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Castelli-Competizione-Bib-Short-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Castelli-Competizione-Bib-Short-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Castelli-Competizione-Bib-Short-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Castelli-Competizione-Bib-Short-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Great Fit</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Excellent pad comfort</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Durable construction</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Heat transfer logos</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Castelli’s value-oriented <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingcyclingbibshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fcastelli-competizione-bib-short-mens\">Competizione Bib Short</a> incorporates many features of its more expensive offerings, at a much more accessible price. The fit is still excellent – a hallmark of all Castelli bib shorts – and the construction quality is top-notch as well, meaning you’ll get a lot of great rides out of these bib shorts.</p><p></p><p>The Competizione features the Kiss Air2 pad, which is amazingly comfortable, thanks to its stretchy, soft skin-care layer that provides total freedom of movement with minimum bulk, according to Castelli. After testing, we can confirm it’s soft against the skin whilst on the saddle and agree that the Kiss Air2 pad is less bulky than the higher-end Progetto pad, and feels better able to contour to the body. The stability and moisture control of the Kiss Air2 isn’t quite up to the Progetto’s level but are still excellent.  </p><p></p><p>The fit is race-oriented with longer-than-average leg length and nicely articulated panels that create a smooth, aerodynamic fit in the riding position. Aerodynamic fabric, dubbed “Vortex” by Castelli flanks the outer legs. While it is hard to quantify its aerodynamic properties, it is definitely comfortable and breathes very well. </p><p></p><p>The straps are a traditional mesh design with excellent stretch and a fabric soft enough to forego a base layer and wear directly against the skin.

They aren’t perfect, but overall they are a treat to ride in and represent a solid value. </p><p></p><p>The pad is the core of any pair of bib shorts, and the material, design, and positioning are all critical to how any pair performs. Here is where the Sportful hits the mark, with their TC (Total Comfort) Pro pad, featuring a triple-density design, with 5mm perforations that Sportful claims enhance airflow. While airflow doesn’t necessarily seem enhanced by the TC Pro pad, the perforated surface seems to lend a bit more flex to the pad, allowing it to conform perfectly to the body.</p><p></p><p>The fit is compressive and the sizing runs on the small side. The other models tested were all size medium but Sportful’s large proved to be a snug but comfortable fit. The Body Fit PRO LTD is much more comfortable on the bike than while standing up, which brings us to the one disappointment of the Body Fit Pro LTD, which is the straps. The material and design mean that the straps invariably twist and bunch up whenever they are pulled over the shoulders. Also, it takes more work to pull them on, because they are designed for an unwavering hold on the shoulders. Once the straps are flattened and positioned, they fit comfortably, although the strap material is rather rough to the touch, meaning we would recommend using these with a base layer to prevent irritation. </p><p></p><p>Out on the road, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingcyclingbibshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fsportful-bodyfit-pro-ltd-bib-short-mens\">Sportful Body Fit Pro LTD</a> are a joy to ride in, providing a unique feeling of a firm main body with a supple and plush pad. This encourages a more aggressive posture, without feeling any excessive pressure from the saddle.

Having so much variety is fantastic, but it can make it difficult to understand exactly what you need. In this section, we’ll cover some of the important things to consider when searching for your next pair of cycling bib shorts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bib Shorts vs Non-Bib Shorts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The term “bib shorts” is a bit confusing, since we don’t usually think of shorts as including shoulder straps. So, what’s the deal with these straps? To understand their purpose and benefit, it’s helpful to visualize how you’ll be positioned during your ride. On a road bike, your hips are hinged forward, and your spine is extended, positioning your shoulders well forward of your hips. With this position in mind, you’ll see that because bib short straps wrap around your shoulders, the forward flexion of your body helps the straps keep the bib shorts under a bit of tension. This tension in the straps keeps the shorts – most critically, the pad – securely positioned for better support and comfort than a pair of padded shorts without straps can provide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, since the straps are holding the shorts in position, there is no need for a tight waistband to perform that task. This reduces pressure on the abdomen, and it means that your shorts won’t slip down or sag over the course of a ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Pad</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The pad, or “chamois”, is the most critical element of any bib short, as it creates a functional interface between your ischium – often called sitz bones – and the saddle of your bicycle. This pad is attached, typically stitched, to the inside of the shorts and is a cushioned layer between your body and saddle. When combined with snug-fitting shorts, the pad should be tight against your skin. In addition to providing some cushion, these pads are also intended to absorb and wick away moisture. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pad shape, thickness, and foam density all vary between bib short models, depending on the duration and intensity of the riding for which they were designed. Endurance rides over three hours will be more pleasant when using a thicker and denser pad. More substantial padding will not only better protect your backside from road buzz and harsh bumps, but the extra material will retain the shape to resist creasing or bunching. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, racers may prefer a thinner, lower-density pad which offers a more direct connection to the saddle with less interference and friction during high-cadence pedaling. Low-density pads are supple and accommodating, meaning the pelvis can rotate forward freely to achieve an aggressive riding position. Low-density padding can easily articulate to your anatomy, which may offer a more secure and naturally comfortable fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond thickness, pads also vary in length and width, and this will factor into whether your bibs fit properly. Thankfully, many companies have incorporated size-specific pads that are designed to match the size of the legs and waist. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chamois-pad-detail.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2272\" height=\"1515\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chamois-pad-detail.jpeg\" alt=\"Cycling bib shorts chamois pad detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chamois-pad-detail.jpeg 2272w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chamois-pad-detail-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chamois-pad-detail-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chamois-pad-detail-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chamois-pad-detail-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chamois-pad-detail-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chamois-pad-detail-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chamois-pad-detail-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The pad, or chamois, is a critical component of cycling bib shorts intended to enhance seated comfort. They vary between brands and intended uses with a range of thicknesses, densities, and materials used in their construction. (photo: Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Materials and Stitching</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most cycling shorts are made from similar materials that consist of a blend of nylon/polyester/polyamide and lycra/spandex/elastane. These fabrics are designed to be thin, lightweight, and quick drying while also providing a good amount of stretch and/or compression. The main body of the shorts is typically divided up into panels with the goal of contouring the shorts to the shape of the body. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These panels then need to be stitched together and the stitching can markedly affect the fit and comfort of bib shorts. More advanced bib shorts will be constructed with less stitching, thanks to articulated and flexible fabrics, and more intelligent arrangement of the fabric panels that surround your body. Poorly placed stitching can result in puckered material or compromised fit and support, while less or better-oriented stitching will often provide a feeling of a second skin. Stitched seams are also one of the most common points of failure on bib shorts, because of the high degree of pulling and friction to which seams are subjected along with the significant stretch built into the fabrics used in their construction. Therefore, minimal and intelligently placed stitching is key for both comfort and the longevity of bib shorts. While significant stretchiness is required for bib shorts, this stretch must be balanced with durability and support. More advanced fabrics balance all three of these demands and also evacuate moisture rapidly during intense efforts in warm conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-stitching.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2117\" height=\"1411\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-stitching.jpeg\" alt=\"Cycling bib shorts stitching detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-stitching.jpeg 2117w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-stitching-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-stitching-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-stitching-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-stitching-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-stitching-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-stitching-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-stitching-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>All bib shorts are made from stretchy fabrics with panels that are stitched together. Well-executed stitching is key to long-term comfort. (photo: Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Straps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bib short straps must stretch to fit a wide range of torso and shoulder shapes, but should also remain flat against the body and avoid chafing your chest and shoulders. Generating sufficient hold to provide a solid connection between the upper and lower body requires strap material to have an evenly-balanced elasticity. Ideally, you won’t feel the straps on your upper body after a few minutes on the bike, but rather just a very light tension over the shoulders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, straps were constructed of simple polyester mesh with thicker stitched trim at the edges. This style of strap worked well for the simple task of holding the shorts up and back but tended to twist and bunch up, creating pressure points and chafing. These days most bib shorts feature broad, flat straps that are perforated or made of semi-transparent material, often with edges that are raw-cut, rather than stitched. This type of strap stays flat against the skin to prevent chafing and remains cool enough to keep you dry and comfortable. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-straps-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-straps-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Cycling bib shorts straps\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-straps-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-straps-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-straps-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-straps-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-straps-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-straps-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-straps-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-straps-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Shoulder straps are a key design element of all cycling bib shorts that keeps your shorts (and the pad) in place while riding, but they vary in design, materials, and construction.

Well-executed grippers achieve this without generating excessive friction on the skin or impeding the stretch of the short’s material in accommodating the motion of pedaling. Many bib shorts, like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingcyclingbibshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fcastelli-free-aero-rc-bib-short-mens\">Castelli Free Aero RC</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingcyclingbibshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fcastelli-endurance-2-bib-short-mens\">Castelli Endurance 3</a>, forego grippers altogether, by using lycra panels in the lower leg that generate grip by way of compression alone. Since the quadriceps expand and contract dramatically during each pedal stroke, grippers do affect fit at the opening of the leg. In a perfectly fitting bib short with the best gripper style for you, there should be no visible gaps between the bib short opening and your leg throughout your pedaling motion.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Leg-gripper-detail.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2272\" height=\"1515\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Leg-gripper-detail.jpeg\" alt=\"Leg gripper detail on cycling bib shorts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Leg-gripper-detail.jpeg 2272w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Leg-gripper-detail-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Leg-gripper-detail-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Leg-gripper-detail-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Leg-gripper-detail-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Leg-gripper-detail-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Leg-gripper-detail-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Leg-gripper-detail-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Different brands approach leg grippers in different ways.

Cycling style is constantly changing, and although tight lycra kits are still the preferred apparel for the job, bright, busy, and logo-heavy designs have given way to more subdued looks. Most cycling tops and bottoms are now available in solid color options that have a more understated and timeless style. Colors and tones are generally somewhat muted and earthy, although some brighter options are offered by certain brands. Patterns haven’t gone away, and many brands have both shorts and jerseys with pattern designs, stripes, or team/brand logos. The great thing is there are lots of options, so you can choose the gear that suits your personal aesthetic so you can look how you want to.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-style-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-style-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Cycling bib shorts style\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-style-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-style-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-style-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-style-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-style-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-style-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-style-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-style-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Style is both personal and ever-changing, and these days, cycling style can be whatever you like.

The next best option is to assume your cycling posture when trying any bib shorts you are considering. In this position, assess the overall fit and feel, checking closely for any discomfort or ill-fitting areas. It’s fair to also judge bib shorts based on how easy (or difficult) it is to pull the straps up and over your shoulders. That said, remember that bib shorts are <em>not</em> designed to be perfectly comfortable when standing upright, and that’s precisely why it’s important to use the cycling position to assess their fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If possible, we recommend trying bib shorts on to ensure they are a correct fit. Like any other clothing, they come in a range of sizes to fit various body shapes and sizes. Bib shorts are designed to be form-fitting and have stretch engineered into the fabrics. All provide at least a little compression, although some are specifically designed to be highly compressive. They should be supportive, comfortable, and free of excessively loose or tight spots or pressure points that could cause discomfort over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, most brands have detailed sizing charts and/or fit guides to help you narrow in on your size.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-fit-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-fit-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Cycling bib shorts fit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-fit-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-fit-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-fit-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-fit-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-fit-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-fit-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-fit-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-fit-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Cycling bib shorts are designed to be form-fitting and when sized correctly, they should be like a second skin that goes virtually unnoticed while riding.

Getting a saddle that fits your anatomy and intended use is an absolute must for any serious cyclist. Saddles come in varying widths, profiles, and designs to suit different sit-bone widths, body shapes, and riding styles, and finding the right one can make a huge difference in your comfort, enjoyment, and performance on the bike. There are loads of saddle options on the market, so if you’re experiencing seated discomfort on the bike, we’d recommend experimenting with different models to find something that fits your body and the type of riding you do.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-saddle-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-saddle-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Cycling bib shorts on the saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-saddle-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-saddle-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-saddle-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-saddle-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-saddle-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-saddle-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-saddle-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-saddle-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Choosing the right saddle is an important factor when it comes to comfort while cycling.

While some of the most expensive options, like the <a href=\"https://velocio.cc/collections/mens-bibs-shorts-tights/products/mens-luxe-bib-short?variant=40521369452617\">Velocio LUXE</a>, proved to be our favorite, mid-priced models like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingcyclingbibshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2F7mesh-industries-mk3-bib-short-mens\">7Mesh MK3</a> and Castelli Free Aero RC perform pretty much just as well and will save you a few bucks. Even the least expensive models we tested, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingcyclingbibshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F168784%2Fpearl-izumi-attack-bib-bike-shorts-mens\">Pearl Izumi Attack</a> and The <a href=\"https://theblackbibs.com/collections/mens-bibs/products/the-black-bibs-ultimate\">Black Bibs Ultimate</a> are really solid options that cost roughly a third of the price of the high-end models. So, while you can spend a bit more for fancier materials, pads, and more refined designs and construction, the wallet-friendly options are certainly worthy of consideration if you’re operating on a tighter budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-riding-shot-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-riding-shot-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding in the Rapha Pro Team Training Cycling bib shorts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-riding-shot-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-riding-shot-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-riding-shot-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-riding-shot-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-riding-shot-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-riding-shot-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-riding-shot-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cycling-bib-shorts-riding-shot-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>There are loads of stellar bib shorts on the market at a range of price points.

Sure, you can ride without padded shorts, but… Padded shorts exist for a reason, and that is to enhance your seated comfort, and ultimately your enjoyment on the bike. While thin, seat pads, or chamois, provide a layer of cushioning between your sit bones and perineum and your bike’s saddle. These pads are roughly the shape of a bike saddle with padding strategically placed to provide cushioning and support. These pads also serve to absorb and wick away sweat and moisture which helps improve comfort and potentially reduces the likelihood of sores, irritation, and infection. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Why should I choose bibs over regular (non-bib) shorts?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>While padded shorts without shoulder straps do work okay for cycling, we always prefer to ride in bib shorts for several reasons. Traditional shorts without straps typically have an elastic waistband to keep them snug around the waist and prevent them from slipping down. While somewhat effective, the tension on the waist can press on the abdomen, especially when in the forward riding position, which can be quite uncomfortable. Additionally, regular shorts usually start to slip down or sag after a while which can reveal some of the lower back and/or allow the pad to move out of its optimal position. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, we feel that bib shorts are far more comfortable. The straps that hold the shorts up negate the need for a tight waistband and help to keep the shorts in the right position without any unwanted pressure on the lower abdomen. When articulated forward in the riding position, the straps keep the shorts from sagging while holding the seat pad in the correct position regardless of how you move around on the bike. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Do you wear underwear under cycling shorts?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Padded cycling shorts are intended to be worn without underwear. There are several reasons, but the first is that the pad itself is designed to be worn directly next to the skin. When fit properly, padded shorts are snug against the body and hold the pad in the correct position. Putting a layer of underwear in between can compromise the pad’s positioning, and the extra material will likely bunch up and cause discomfort, chafing, or irritation over time. The pads are also intended to absorb and wick sweat, and your underwear will likely disrupt this process and hold moisture which can cause additional problems. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Why are cycling bib shorts so expensive?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Like anything in cycling, bib shorts can be very expensive. While you certainly can spend upwards of $300 on a high-end model, there are plenty of options at lower price points that get the job done. The primary differences are in the materials used in the body of the shorts, straps, and seat pad, as well as the design and construction. Most of the time, the high-end models use higher-quality fabrics, fancier pads, and construction methods that result in greater comfort or some marginal performance gains. Racers or those who spend long hours in the saddle multiple days a week will likely notice and benefit from more expensive bib shorts, while those who ride more casually, less frequently, or for shorter periods of time may be just as happy with less expensive options. Fortunately, even the least expensive models we tested are as good as the best shorts on the market from a decade or two ago, so it’s a good time to be a cyclist.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>How much should I spend?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Spend what your budget allows. Plenty of people have lots of disposable income and won’t flinch at paying $300-$400 for the best bib shorts on the market. If you’re on a tighter budget, you don’t have to shell out the big bucks for shorts that will get the job done. One of our top-rated models, the 7Mesh MK3, retails for $200, which is $100 less than the most expensive model we tried. Less expensive options like the Pearl Izumi Attack and The Black Bibs Ultimate cost even less and work very well, especially considering the price. That said, if you’re riding a ton, it may be worth spending more on a high-end model.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Should I Use Chamois Cream?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>This is generally a personal choice as it seems that some riders don’t need it, while others won’t go on a ride without it. If you experience chafing or saddle sores, it may be worth experimenting with certain creams that may help lubricate your seat pad and skin interface to help prevent it. If you do not have any issues with chafing or soreness, you can probably not worry about it. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-helmets/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"1874\" height=\"1249\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1.jpeg\" alt=\"POC Omne Air MIPS road bike helmet\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1.jpeg 1874w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Road Bike Helmets of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-shoes/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Shimano S-Phyre RC9 road bike shoe\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Road Bike Shoes of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-bib-shorts/\">The Best Cycling Bib Shorts of 2023</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Bennett Shane","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"c835ea3793c196453d829e760e490f58e7d25c8c732934dae3ddaef5c817ce2c","category":"Cycling"}
