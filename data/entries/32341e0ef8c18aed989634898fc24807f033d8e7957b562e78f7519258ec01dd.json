The diversion of resources includes hiring AI employees away from Tesla, diverting microchips from Tesla to X (formerly Twitter) and xAI, and \"xAI's use of Tesla's data to develop xAI's own software/hardware, all without compensation to Tesla,\" the lawsuit said.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24747977/2024-06-13-e-filed-verified-stockholder-derivative-complaint-tesla-xai.pdf\">lawsuit</a> in Delaware Court of Chancery was filed by three Tesla shareholders: the Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund, Daniel Hazen, and Michael Giampietro. It seeks financial damages for Tesla and the disgorging of Musk's equity stake in xAI to Tesla.</p>\n<p>\"Could the CEO of Coca-Cola loyally start a competing soft-drink company on the side, then divert scarce ingredients from Coca-Cola to the startup? Could the CEO of Goldman Sachs loyally start a competing financial advisory company on the side, then hire away key bankers from Goldman Sachs to the startup? Could the board of either company loyally permit such conduct without doing <em>anything</em> about it? Of course not,\" the lawsuit says.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031780#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031780&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"32341e0ef8c18aed989634898fc24807f033d8e7957b562e78f7519258ec01dd","category":"Tech"}
