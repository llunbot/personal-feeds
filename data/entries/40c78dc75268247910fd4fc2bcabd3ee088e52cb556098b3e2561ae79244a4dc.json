That goodwill has now been largely thrown out the window due to <a href=\"https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates\">Unity's Tuesday announcement of a new fee structure</a> that will start charging developers on a \"per-install\" basis after certain minimum thresholds are met.</p>\n<p>The newly introduced Unity Runtime Fee—which will go into effect on January 1, 2024—will impose different per-install costs based on the company's different subscription tiers. Those on the Unity Personal tier (which includes free basic Editor access) will be charged $0.20 per install after an individual game reaches $200,000 in annual revenue and 200,000 lifetime installs.</p>\n<p>Users of Unity's Pro and Enterprise tiers (which charge a separate annual subscription for access to a more full-featured Unity Editor) will pay slightly smaller per-install fees starting at $0.125 to $0.15 after a game reaches $1 million in annual revenue and 1 million total installs. The per-install fees for the paid subscription tiers are also subject to \"volume discounts\" for heavily installed games, going down as low as $0.01 per install for games that are installed 1 million times per month.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968082#p3\">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968082&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"40c78dc75268247910fd4fc2bcabd3ee088e52cb556098b3e2561ae79244a4dc","category":"Tech"}
