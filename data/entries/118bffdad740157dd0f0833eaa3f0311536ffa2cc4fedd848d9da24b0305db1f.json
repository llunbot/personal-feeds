Now, with Tap to Pay on iPhone it's easier than ever for businesses of any size to seamlessly accept contactless payments using only their iPhone, wherever they do business,\" said Jennifer Bailey, Apple's vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. \"The convenience of Tap to Pay on iPhone empowers Australian businesses to offer easy, secure, and private contactless payment experiences to their customers, and help them run and grow their business.\"</blockquote>Westpac and Tyro Payments are the initial payment platforms in Australia supporting Tap to Pay for their business customers. Apple says that additional payment platforms and apps, including ANZ Worldline Payment Solutions, Stripe, Till Payments, and Zeller, will make this secure and convenient capability available in the coming months. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nTap to Pay on ‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌ requires ‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌ XS or newer models, and works for customers as any normal ‌‌‌Apple Pay‌‌‌ transaction would. Sellers just need to open up the app, register the sale, and present their ‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌ to the buyer, who can then use an appropriate contactless payment method.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTap to Pay on ‌‌iPhone‌‌ is available to over <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/wix-now-offers-tap-to-pay-on-iphone/\">700,000 additional businesses</a> across the United States, and Apple Stores in the U.S. have also rolled out the feature.
