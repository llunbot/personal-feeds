Instead of “Let’s talk” — Twitter’s original\ntagline — “Blaze your glory!” is the curious subtitle on X’s iOS\nApp Store listing, which describes the app as “the trusted digital\ntown square for everyone.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You know how people in the South use “<a href=\"https://www.atlantamagazine.com/southern/southern-decoder/\">Bless your heart</a>” derisively? Well, now we have such a phrase for Musk’s shenanigans.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, it would appear that getting this single-character name in their App Store listing <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/28/x-app-android-ios\">required an exemption</a> from Apple. Blaze their glory, I say.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/31/twitter-x-app-store-finally\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"faaf9d6336becf2f25bb39a2438a43d27dc484d7a4c23fc58b012b9e797fa27b","category":"Tech"}
