At just 28 years old, Chris is the youngest <em>directeur sportif </em>in pro-cycling, but he’s got a whole lot of experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cutting his teeth at Team Wiggins and JLT Condor, Chris went on to ride for Team Sky/Ineos, during which time he won the Tour de Yorkshire. As a no-nonsense rider with a stoic mentality, a move into team management naturally followed post-retirement, with Chris taking up a DS position at British Pro-Conti team, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/saint-piran\" target=\"_blank\">Saint Piran</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Chris tells us about the highs and lows of his career on the road, the role of mental toughness and race craft, the problems in the British racing scene and how to nurture Saint Piran young talent to prepare it for the big time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interview begins at 12:50.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow Saint Piran on Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/saintpiran/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@saintpiran</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/cyclist-magazine-podcast/episodes/112-chris-lawless-team-sky-pro-turned-saint-piran-ds\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 112 now on Acast</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\">all episodes</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know <em>Cyclist</em> is also stunning monthly magazine?
