In another case, document management systems used in local courthouses across the country <a href=\"https://github.com/qwell/disclosures/blob/main/README-2023-11-30-disorder-in-the-court.md\">contained</a> multiple <a href=\"https://github.com/qwell/disclosures/blob/main/README-2024-05-17-maricopa.md\">flaws</a> that allowed unauthorized people to access sensitive filings such as psychiatric evaluations that were under seal. And in one case, unauthorized people could assign themselves privileges that are supposed to be available only to clerks of the court and, from there, create, delete, or modify filings.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053460#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053460&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"841fdcfb5d8a17b58177c5d84a430308b54cc86d3cc77055b4a5190ec0e1ce04","category":"Tech"}
