Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>STUTTGART, Germany—Porsche made its reputation with its rear-engined sports cars, but today it's the SUVs that even make that possible. But it makes those SUVs in order to appeal to Porsche drivers, offering five-door practicality but with driver-engaging handling, and a certain level of fit and finish. I've always thought of the Macan as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/03/review-the-porsche-macan-gts-might-be-an-suv-but-its-all-porsche/\">Porsche's answer to the hot hatch</a>, and now it's gone electric. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/the-2024-porsche-macan-ev-has-character-pace-and-the-right-badge/\">We tested two variants</a> of the new Macan EV earlier this year, and came away impressed. Now we've had seat time in another pair: the $75,300 rear-wheel drive Macan, and the $84,900 Macan 4S.</p>\n<p>Ars has written <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/porsches-macan-ev-comes-out-in-2024-we-drive-the-prototype/\">quite a lot</a> about the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/porsche-gives-ars-a-look-inside-its-next-ev-the-all-electric-macan/\">development</a> of the Macan's Premium Platform Electric, which it helped develop with VW sibling Audi. Porsche has a lot of history adapting VW group platforms, from the previous generations of Cayenne and Macan all the way back to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/driving-a-priceless-historic-porsche-meet-the-very-first-356-from-1948/\">the very first car to wear the family name</a>, 356/1, which spiced up some Beetle bits in a handsome roadster body.</p>\n<h2>Macan</h2>\n<p>The entry level Macan is unique among the range for having just a single electric motor, which drives the rear wheels. With a nominal 335 hp (250 kW)—boosted to 355 hp (265 kW) with launch control—and 415 lb-ft (562 Nm), it's the least-powerful Macan but also the lightest (by 242 lbs/110 kg) and the most efficient, with an EPA range estimate of 315 miles (506 km) from the 100 kWh (95 kWh useable) battery pack.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/we-drive-the-two-sweet-spots-in-porsches-2025-macan-ev-lineup/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/we-drive-the-two-sweet-spots-in-porsches-2025-macan-ev-lineup/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
