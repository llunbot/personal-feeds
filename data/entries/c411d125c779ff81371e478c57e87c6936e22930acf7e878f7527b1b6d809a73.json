The device was met with mixed reviews; critics praised its outstanding sound quality but pointed out its high price, missing features, and limited functionality compared to rivals.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/04/apple-cuts-homepod-price-worldwide/\">dropped its price</a> from $349 to $299 in April 2019 and, in March 2021, the company announced that it was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinuing-homepod/\">discontinuing</a> the first-generation ‌HomePod‌, instead shifting its focus to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>, which launched the previous year. The decision left a gap in Apple's product lineup for a full-sized smart speaker until the company introduced the second-generation model via a press release on January 18, 2023.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe second-generation ‌HomePod‌ looks virtually identical to the original, although it is 0.2 inches shorter and has a larger edge-to-edge LED touchscreen on top. It also boasts a range of upgrades and changes compared to its 2018 predecessor, including the S7 chip, a U1 ultra wideband chip, a removable power cable, a temperature and humidity sensor, and sound recognition. However, it features two fewer microphones and horn-loaded tweeters.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile Apple's potential plans for a third-generation ‌HomePod‌ are unclear two years after the current model was introduced, there are a multitude of rumors surrounding a smart home \"command center\" product <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/future-homepod-to-add-curved-lcd-display/\">with an LCD touchscreen display</a> arriving this year as Apple looks to rethink its smart home lineup.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/03/apple-homepod-relaunch-two-years-ago/\">Apple Relaunched the HomePod Two Years Ago Today</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-relaunched-the-homepod-two-years-ago-today.2448665/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c411d125c779ff81371e478c57e87c6936e22930acf7e878f7527b1b6d809a73","category":"Apple"}
