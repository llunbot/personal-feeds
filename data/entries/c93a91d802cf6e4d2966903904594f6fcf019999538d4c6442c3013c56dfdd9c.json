A source at Blue Origin said this tank could start to undergo a series of tests to determine its strength and ability to hold pressurized propellants as soon as next month.</p>\n<p>Although Blue Origin has not publicly discussed this effort to build a reusable upper stage for the New Glenn rocket, sources said the company's primary goal is to bring down the overall launch cost of the New Glenn rocket. The vehicle's large upper stage, which has a 7-meter diameter and two BE-3U engines, is costly. Making New Glenn fully reusable is necessary for Blue Origin to compete with SpaceX's Starship launch system.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789414#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789414&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c93a91d802cf6e4d2966903904594f6fcf019999538d4c6442c3013c56dfdd9c","category":"Tech"}
