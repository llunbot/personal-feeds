[...] </p>\n\n<p>“I don’t think that the Apple thing is going to have any \ndifference for us because I think that the way that they’ve \nimplemented it, I would be very surprised if any developer chose \nto go into the alternative app stores that they have,” \nZuckerberg told investors. “They’ve made it so onerous, and I \nthink, so at odds with the intent of what the EU regulation was \nthat I think it’s just going to be very difficult for anyone — including ourselves — to really seriously entertain what \nthey’re doing there.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Left unsaid is what Zuckerberg thinks the intent of the DMA is. I, for one, do not think is was “Make Meta very happy.” Keep in mind that Apple has broken no laws, and the DMA is, ostensibly, not a penalty targeting Apple specifically.</p>\n\n<p>Also keep in mind that <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/13/meta-plans-to-take-a-nearly-50percent-cut-on-nft-sales-in-its-metaverse.html\">Meta charges a 47.5 percent commission</a> for digital content sales in Horizon Worlds, its “metaverse” platform for its VR headsets.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/03/tiny-violins-for-zuck\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e929b677f76f2974b3c10403fe5ea57c7c94f8bf19d05820099ffe539fb1b0af","category":"Tech"}
