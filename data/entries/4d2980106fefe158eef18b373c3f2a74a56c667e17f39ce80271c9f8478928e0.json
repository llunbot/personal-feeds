Apple said committed automakers included Acura, Audi, Ford, Honda, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Porsche, Volvo, and a few others.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Next-Generation CarPlay Features</h2>\r<br />\n<h3>Instrument Cluster Integration</h3>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Multi-Display-CarPlay-2.jpeg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"896\" />\r<br />\nThe new CarPlay experience will provide integration with a vehicle's instrument cluster, including the speedometer, tachometer, odometer, fuel gauge, engine temperature gauge, oil pressure gauge, and more.
