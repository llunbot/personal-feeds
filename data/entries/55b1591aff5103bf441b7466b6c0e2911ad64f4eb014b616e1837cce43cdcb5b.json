This means the new Mac Pro is over twice as fast as the fastest Intel-based model, and given that all configurations include the M2 Ultra chip, this performance can be had for a much lower $6,999.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Mac-Pro-2023-Geekbench.jpg\" alt width=\"1298\" height=\"828\" /><div><em>Mac14,8 = 2023 Mac Pro</em></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnsurprisingly, these scores are virtually identical to those that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/10/m2-ultra-chip-benchmarks/\">surfaced for the Mac Studio</a> with the M2 Ultra chip a few days ago. The new Mac Pro is aimed at customers who need PCI Express expansion, but anyone else should <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-studio-vs-mac-pro/\">consider the Mac Studio</a> for their desktop computer needs, as it can be configured with the M2 Ultra chip for $3,999.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new Mac Pro has the same overall design as the 2019 model, but it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/11/apple-exec-discusses-mac-pro-lack-of-egpu-support/\">no longer supports graphics cards</a> and does not have user-upgradeable RAM due to Apple silicon's unified memory.
