And we got an exclusive first look riding it on Spanish gravel a few weeks back. Now fast forward back to today, and this new Rose Backroad FF carbon gravel bike hits a killer sweetspot balancing race-ready performance and all-day comfort. Plus, it does that while remaining just as affordable as ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2024 Rose Backroad FF carbon gravel race bike </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_seaside.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_seaside.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rose Backroad FF light fast comfortable aero carbon gravel race bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_seaside.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_seaside-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_seaside-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_seaside-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_seaside-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_seaside-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_seaside-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rose developed the new Backroad FF to have a UCI-approved carbon gravel bike for racing.

Adding relative affordability into the mix feels almost unheard of. But this new carbon Rose Backroad FF gravel race bike seems to tick almost all of the boxes…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_pretty-in-pink.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_pretty-in-pink.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rose Backroad FF light fast comfortable aero carbon gravel race bike, pretty in pink\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_pretty-in-pink.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_pretty-in-pink-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_pretty-in-pink-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_pretty-in-pink-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_pretty-in-pink-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_pretty-in-pink-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Rose)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the third generation of Rose’s Backroad gravel bike that I’ve ridden. And it truly seems to get better each time. The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/exclusive-all-new-rose-backroad-teases-update-to-affordable-carbon-gravel-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">last Backroad</a> was already a great fully integrated do-it-all gravel bike, but this FF Fast Forward evolution takes it to the next level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new frame and fork feature a profile that really doesn’t stand out all that much from the current crop of modern aero gravel race bikes and looks just like their aero road bike. But Rose seems to have nailed the details – from refined geometry to carbon materials to a set of aero finishing kit components that retain rider comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_frameset-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_frameset-detail.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rose Backroad FF light fast comfortable aero carbon gravel race bike, framseset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_frameset-detail.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_frameset-detail-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_frameset-detail-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_frameset-detail-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_frameset-detail-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_frameset-detail-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Rose)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The hi-mod carbon frame and fork feature more race-oriented geometry with a slightly steeper headtube angle vs. the previous generation. But a more forward weight balance with a steeper seat angle, slightly longer frame reach, and much lower frame Stack heights. It’s a more aggressive fit on the bike, but the slight riser cockpit balances things out a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_drivetrain-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_drivetrain-detail.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rose Backroad FF lightweight affordable comfortable aero carbon gravel race bike, drivetrain\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_drivetrain-detail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_drivetrain-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_drivetrain-detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_drivetrain-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_drivetrain-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_drivetrain-detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_drivetrain-detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Rose)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The FF frame utilizes the UDH standard so you can still with the conventional hanger for existing gravel derailleurs, or even go direct-mount for a new AXS T-Type mullet Eagle setup down the (gravel) road. Built with 1x drivetrains and a bolt-on Wolftooth chainguide, but you could also run a wireless 2x if you are still into that kind of thing. There are two sets of bottle cages inside the frame (3-bolt on the downtube). Plus, direct mount studs for the frame bag and a toptube bag mount. No fork or under downtube mounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new race bike is optimized for 40mm tires when you are looking for the best aerodynamic gains, but they actually measure up a bit wider on these 27mm internal rims. Plus, there’s officially clearance for a max 45mm tire if you want to go wider, with room for muddy gravel buildup.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Riding Impressions</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/First-Rides-Review-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_non-driveside-riding.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/First-Rides-Review-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_non-driveside-riding.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rose Backroad FF light fast comfortable aero carbon gravel race bike, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/First-Rides-Review-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_non-driveside-riding.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/First-Rides-Review-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_non-driveside-riding-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/First-Rides-Review-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_non-driveside-riding-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/First-Rides-Review-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_non-driveside-riding-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/First-Rides-Review-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_non-driveside-riding-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/First-Rides-Review-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_non-driveside-riding-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This new bike simply makes you feel fast when you ride it. And never beaten up, no matter how long or rough the gravel ride is. Sure, this is a bike intended for racing, and it doesn’t have a ton of extra adventure mounts. But it’s really a great all-rounder that will make every gravel ride feel faster and easier. I just spent a week testing a dozen bikes with a handful of bike industry insider friends, and occasionally racing each other. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rose-Backroad-FF-gravel-Review_light-fast-comfy-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_high-intensity-racing-on-Instax-film.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rose-Backroad-FF-gravel-Review_light-fast-comfy-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_high-intensity-racing-on-Instax-film.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rose Backroad FF light fast comfortable aero carbon gravel race bike, racing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rose-Backroad-FF-gravel-Review_light-fast-comfy-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_high-intensity-racing-on-Instax-film.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rose-Backroad-FF-gravel-Review_light-fast-comfy-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_high-intensity-racing-on-Instax-film-297x190.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rose-Backroad-FF-gravel-Review_light-fast-comfy-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_high-intensity-racing-on-Instax-film-800x512.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rose-Backroad-FF-gravel-Review_light-fast-comfy-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_high-intensity-racing-on-Instax-film-120x77.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rose-Backroad-FF-gravel-Review_light-fast-comfy-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_high-intensity-racing-on-Instax-film-768x492.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rose-Backroad-FF-gravel-Review_light-fast-comfy-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_high-intensity-racing-on-Instax-film-1536x983.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Jon Woodruff)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And we literally fought over this bike before every ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Review-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_riding-in-Murcia-Spain.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1012\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Review-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_riding-in-Murcia-Spain.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rose Backroad FF light fast comfortable aero carbon gravel race bike, riding in Spain\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Review-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_riding-in-Murcia-Spain.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Review-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_riding-in-Murcia-Spain-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Review-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_riding-in-Murcia-Spain-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Review-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_riding-in-Murcia-Spain-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Review-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_riding-in-Murcia-Spain-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Review-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_riding-in-Murcia-Spain-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Review-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_riding-in-Murcia-Spain-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A big pet peeve of mine with current gravel race bikes is an overly stiff carbon layup. That surely can feel snappy and responsive when you sprint for a town line, but rattles you to finish a long off-road ride worn out. But Rose’s Backroad FF mixes a sense of ease &amp; speed pedaling down fast gravel roads, with real-world comfort that keeps you feeling fresh at the end of a big day out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big part of the seems to come from the shapely narrow carbon cockpit and its riser bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>All-new Rose One-Piece Gravel Cockpit</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_integrated-cockpit-front-view.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1013\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_integrated-cockpit-front-view.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rose Backroad FF light fast comfortable aero carbon gravel race bike, cockpit front view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_integrated-cockpit-front-view.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_integrated-cockpit-front-view-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_integrated-cockpit-front-view-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_integrated-cockpit-front-view-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_integrated-cockpit-front-view-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_integrated-cockpit-front-view-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_integrated-cockpit-front-view-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Rose)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The upward bend of the handlebar seems to isolate annoying gravel road buzz without deadening the feel of the road. It also is quite narrow at the top for an aero position on the turned-in hoods, supported by the flat tops under your forearms. But with a generous flare from the hoods to the long drops, it still feels plenty wide for stability when descending through rough sections. My only nit to pick on this integrated cockpit is that I would like a little more drop in the bar, but I think I could partly solve that simply with a cleaner, thinner bartape wrap.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_One-Piece-Gravel-Cockpit-angled.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_One-Piece-Gravel-Cockpit-angled.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rose Backroad FF light fast comfortable aero carbon gravel race bike, cockpit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_One-Piece-Gravel-Cockpit-angled.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_One-Piece-Gravel-Cockpit-angled-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_One-Piece-Gravel-Cockpit-angled-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_One-Piece-Gravel-Cockpit-angled-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_One-Piece-Gravel-Cockpit-angled-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_One-Piece-Gravel-Cockpit-angled-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_One-Piece-Gravel-Cockpit-angled-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 40cm x 100mm bar I rode sells <a href=\"https://www.rosebikes.com/rose-one-piece-gravel-cockpit-2724845?article_size=100mm%2F40cm\" target=\"_blank\">separately for 350€</a>, available in April. It measures 400mm wide at the hoods, then 495mm at the drops, at a claimed weight of 398g. The bar gets 15° flare, a -10° stem but 20mm of rise back up, then 73mm of reach &amp; 98mm of drop. It also comes in a narrower 38cm width and 3 stem lengths. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to be discounted is the aero section carbon seatpost. I often think an aero bike would be more comfortable with a classic round post, but Rose hit the comfort sweet spot on this D-shaped post, too.

With a magnetic flip toptube bag like one of my favorites Apidura Racing bag and a simple waterproof zip partial frame bag that still lets you use 2 water bottles. I haven’t tried either – opting for a bolt-on Tailfin toptube bag. But they look clean and well executed for riders looking for dedicated on-bike storage (without the complication &amp; added weight of in-frame gloveboxes).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2024 Rose Backroad FF – Pricing, spec &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_8390g-actual-weight.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_8390g-actual-weight.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rose Backroad FF light fast comfortable aero carbon gravel race bike, 8.39kg actual weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_8390g-actual-weight.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_8390g-actual-weight-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_8390g-actual-weight-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_8390g-actual-weight-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_8390g-actual-weight-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_8390g-actual-weight-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Rose-Backroad-FF-lightweight-affordable-comfortable-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_8390g-actual-weight-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>2024 Rose Backroad FF Force AXS XPLR (Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new carbon Rose <a href=\"http://www.rosebikes.com/bikes/gravel/race/backroad-ff\" target=\"_blank\">Backroad FF</a> comes in just two SRAM AXS wireless complete builds, both with integrated power meters.
