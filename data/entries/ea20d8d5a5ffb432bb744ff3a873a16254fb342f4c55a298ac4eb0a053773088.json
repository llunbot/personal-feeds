Rather, it’s an all-new take on gravel bikes that lets you get out there and adventure, with a fit and ride that’ll make mountain bikers feel right at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-riding.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1700\" height=\"1961\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-riding.webp\" alt=\"rider in a field on the new niner ORE gravel bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-riding.webp 1700w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-riding-260x300.webp 260w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-riding-1536x1772.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-riding-104x120.webp 104w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-riding-768x886.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-riding-1332x1536.webp 1332w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>ORE (Off Road Explorer) is a slacker, rowdier option than the racier RLT (Road Less Traveled). It still has a ton of mounts for bottles, bags, and other accessories, just with geometry that’s more fit for getting deeper into the woods and more at home on singletrack.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-front-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1707\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-front-scaled.webp\" alt=\"niner ORE gravel bike shown from the front.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-front-scaled.webp 1707w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-front-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-front-1536x2303.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-front-80x120.webp 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-front-768x1152.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-front-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-front-1366x2048.webp 1366w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Front center is longer thanks to a 1.5º slacker head angle.

The frame is 5.5% lighter than the RLT, and it looks it (very lithe!), yet it’s 28% stiffer both at the BB and rear axle.

Stick with the stock carbon fork and you’ll get improved compliance than the RLT’s fork, and this one is 7% lighter, too. You’ll also get thru-bolt brake mounts, which are a little easier to install and adjust.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-angle.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2200\" height=\"1467\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-angle.webp\" alt=\"niner ORE gravel bike shown from an front angle.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-angle.webp 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-angle-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-angle-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-angle-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-angle-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-angle-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-angle-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-niner-ore-gravel-bike-angle-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of easy adjustments, it sticks with fully-guided internal routing, using standard ports rather than integrated stealth anything through the headset.
