The news caused a drop in Apple's stock, leading some analysts to be concerned about the performance of the ‌iPhone 13‌ and Apple's ability to keep up with demand. Now, however, the company's suppliers are pushing back. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA preview of a paywalled <em>DigiTimes</em> report set to be published tomorrow states, \"component suppliers for Apple's new iPhones have claimed no cutback in orders thus far this year.\" While the news about a cutback in orders may be incorrect, according to suppliers, there is little doubt regarding production challenges for Apple's products. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a> and ‌‌iPhone 13 Pro‌‌ Max, for example, continue to list weeks or even as long as a month for delivery dates. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a>, going on sale this Friday, is also experiencing delays in shipments, with some high-end models leading into early December. A report last week said that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/08/power-outages-china-apple-suppliers-scrambling/\">Apple's suppliers are \"scrambling\"</a> to keep up with production due to new energy regulations in China impacting efficiency. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">digitimes.com</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13\">iPhone 13 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13-Pro\">iPhone 13 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/13/apple-suppliers-iphone-13-production-report/\">Apple Suppliers Refute Report Claiming iPhone 13 Production Being Lowered Due to Chip Shortages</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-suppliers-refute-report-claiming-iphone-13-production-being-lowered-due-to-chip-shortages.2316743/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0G_LByplIrM:Szo4vCpFeRA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0G_LByplIrM:Szo4vCpFeRA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/0G_LByplIrM\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d8beb5805acd425ba28ebaa16805550d9d262f6e42924e270457639e87cba18d","category":"Apple"}
