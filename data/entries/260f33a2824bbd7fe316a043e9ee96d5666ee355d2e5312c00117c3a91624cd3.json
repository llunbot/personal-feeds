With the new software, you can initiate a Mac-to-Mac restoration process right from the Finder app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/mac-studio-green.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIn <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-13/\">macOS Ventura</a> and earlier, reviving or restoring a Mac requires a second Mac that has the Apple Configurator app installed, but in ‌macOS Sonoma‌, Apple Configurator is no longer required.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>New in macOS Sonoma: You can now use one Mac to revive or restore another Mac that's in DFU mode right from Finder. <br /><br />Previously you needed to install Apple Configurator to do this but now it's built in!<br /><br />Accidentally stumbled upon this while playing around with some stuff. <a href=\"https://t.co/NaUdGuTFZl\">pic.twitter.com/NaUdGuTFZl</a></p>— Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1691241183463317504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 15, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nRestoring or reviving using Finder is basically the same process as <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-configurator-mac/revive-or-restore-a-mac-with-apple-silicon-apdd5f3c75ad/\">restoring with Configurator</a>, just without the need for additional software. The two Macs will still need to be connected to one another through a USB-C cable, and the same steps will likely apply. Both machines will need to have ‌macOS Sonoma‌ installed to use Finder for a restore.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDFU mode can occur when there is a power failure during a macOS update or upgrade, leading to a Mac that is unresponsive. In this situation, a second Mac is required to get the affected Mac back to a functional state.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌macOS Sonoma‌ is in beta testing at the current time, and is expected to see a launch in a month or two.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/\">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243\">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/macos-sonoma-dfu-mode/\">macOS Sonoma Simplifies Restoring a Mac in DFU Mode</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-sonoma-simplifies-restoring-a-mac-in-dfu-mode.2398727/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"260f33a2824bbd7fe316a043e9ee96d5666ee355d2e5312c00117c3a91624cd3","category":"Apple"}
