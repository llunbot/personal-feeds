Today we're tracking sales on Apple Pencil 2, Apple TV 4K, and the MacBook Air.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/ipad-mini-apple-pencil-green.jpg\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

This sale is a match of one of the lowest prices that we've ever tracked for the Apple Pencil 2, and as of writing it's only available on Amazon. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07K1WWBJK\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$29 OFF</div>Apple Pencil 2 for $99.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe very rarely see the Apple Pencil 2 dip below this sale price, so if you've been on the hunt for one at a discount, now's a great time to buy. The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the following iPads: iPad mini (6th generation), iPad Air (4th generation), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (3rd, 4th, and 5th generations), and 11-inch iPad Pro (1st, 2nd, and 3rd generations).\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Apple TV 4K</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nNext, Amazon has the 32GB Apple TV 4K (2021) for <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0933D3SN6\"><strong>$169.00</strong></a>, down from $179.00. This is the second-best price that we've ever tracked on this model of the Apple TV 4K, and it's been the most consistent discount on the accessory.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-design-green.jpg\" /><div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0933D3SN6\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$10 OFF</div>32GB Apple TV 4K for $169.00</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nYou can also get the 64GB Apple TV 4K for <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0933D8TNB%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue\"><strong>$189.98</strong></a>, down from $199.00. We've seen this Apple TV 4K discounted by an additional $10, so this sale is another second-best price. Both of these Apple TVs are sold by Amazon, and they're in stock and ready to ship today.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>MacBook Air</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nLastly, you can get the 256GB M1 MacBook Air for <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08N5M7S6K%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1\"><strong>$899.00</strong></a>, down from $999.00 in all three colors of Gold, Silver, and Space Gray. This is currently the best price available online among the major Apple resellers, and overall it's the second-best price we've tracked.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/macbook-air-deals.jpg\" /><div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08N5M7S6K%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$100 OFF</div>256GB M1 MacBook Air for $899.00</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe 512GB M1 MacBook Air is also on sale, available for <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08N5LFLC3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1\"><strong>$1,149.99</strong></a>, down from $1,249.00. Similar to the 256GB model, this is a second-best price on this 2020 MacBook Air. Both notebooks are shipped and sold directly from Amazon.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHead to our full <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Deals Roundup</a> to get caught up with all of the latest deals and discounts that we've been tracking over the past week.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/02/deals-amazon-pre-black-friday/\">Deals: Amazon's Pre-Black Friday Sales Continue With $29 Off Apple Pencil 2, $10 Off Apple TV 4K, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/deals-amazons-pre-black-friday-sales-continue-with-29-off-apple-pencil-2-10-off-apple-tv-4k-and-more.2321376/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Huu9SoqqHRU:aLi3f-v8vgs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Huu9SoqqHRU:aLi3f-v8vgs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Huu9SoqqHRU\" />","author":"Mitchel Broussard","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"93e45d71b29aaac3bb9f26cfc8acf6fc9a1376c413294894aa9e7e63bb5f4355","category":"Apple"}
