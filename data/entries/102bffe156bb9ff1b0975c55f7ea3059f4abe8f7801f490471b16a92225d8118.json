However, there is a way to make it show more, which can be useful if your workflow involves using a lot of undocked apps consecutively.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you're comfortable pasting commands into Terminal, it's perfectly possible to increase or decrease the number of recently opened apps that show in your Dock. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/10-recently-opened-apps.jpg\" alt=\"recently opened\" width=\"1190\" height=\"284\" />\r<br />\nOpen a Terminal window (the app can be found in /Applications/Utilities/) and paste the following at the command prompt, then press <strong>Enter</strong>:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>defaults write com.apple.dock show-recents -bool true;\r<br />\ndefaults write com.apple.dock show-recent-count -int 10;\r<br />\nkillall Dock</strong>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNote that the <strong>-int</strong> argument defines the number of recently opened apps that you want to display in the Dock after the divider (10 in this example). You can change the number to suit, and you can revert back to showing three apps anytime by using <strong>-int 3</strong> in the second command.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/show-more-recent-apps-macos-dock/\">Show More (or Fewer) Recent Apps in Your Mac's Dock</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/show-more-or-fewer-recent-apps-in-your-macs-dock.2457930/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"102bffe156bb9ff1b0975c55f7ea3059f4abe8f7801f490471b16a92225d8118","category":"Apple"}
