Pressing it pauses the video, and pressing the button again unpauses. You can still stop a video at any time using the middle stop button.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple added the new video pausing feature in the ‌iOS 18‌ release candidate that was provided to developers and public beta testers today.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's likely that pausing and recording video will be a feature of the Camera Control button that's included on all of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌iOS 18‌ is set to be released on Monday, September 16, while the ‌iPhone 16‌ models will launch on Friday, September 20.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2024-apple-event/\">September 2024 Apple Event</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/ios-18-pause-video-recording/\">iOS 18 Has New Option to Pause Video Recording</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-has-new-option-to-pause-video-recording.2435606/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"233c13d120e359a70defd2fef27b39fc9ea64076a5c95c9c33339b07eb0ae15f","category":"Apple"}
