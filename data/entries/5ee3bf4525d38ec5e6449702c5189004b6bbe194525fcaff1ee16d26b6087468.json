Fort William Scotland . downhill mountain bike world championships . August 2023\" title=\"Matt Walker 's Saracen Myst DH bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> To celebrate the host nation, Walker has his Saracen painted in British Racing Green.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>Matt Walker’s Saracen has an eye-catching British Racing Green paintjob with marbled finish and Shropshire flag (his Scottish teammate Greg Williamson’s is blue with a tartan motif), but the bike underneath is pretty special, too. It’s a new Myst, designed to remain more active under braking.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Matt Walker 's Saracen Myst DH bike . Fort William Scotland . downhill mountain bike world championships . August 2023\" title=\"Matt Walker 's Saracen Myst DH\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Saracen has followed other manufacturers and given the Myst a concentric rear-axle pivot.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>On the team’s previous race bikes, this was achieved by attaching a floating brake arm. Here, Saracen has added a concentric rear-axle pivot – a design also used by Trek and Pivot. This effectively turns the Myst from a single-pivot design with linkage-actuated <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-rear-shocks/\">shock</a> into a four-bar linkage bike. The shock is now driven by a system of three links.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Matt Walker 's Saracen Myst DH bike . Fort William Scotland . downhill mountain bike world championships . August 2023\" title=\"Matt Walker 's Saracen Myst DH bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The British Racing Green of the frame was complemented by a CNC-machined linkage.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>The first prototype of the bike was tested at European races early in the year. This is the second iteration, which, according to Matt’s mechanic Ewan Collier, should be in production soon.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to improve the ride balance and separate the suspension from braking to suit modern shorter but increasingly fast tracks, without completely redesigning the frame,” he explains. Apparently, brake jack is much reduced compared to the old Myst, which was built with more of a focus on pedalling.</p>\n<h2>Neko Mulally’s Frameworks Racing/Cotic colab prototype</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Neko Mulally Frameworks Racing Cotic 853 Steel DH bike collaboration prototype Fort William Scotland . downhill mountain bike world championships .

Apparently, he was looking to improve durability, but was also interested to see if there was any performance advantage in terms of grip.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Neko Mulally Frameworks Racing Cotic 853 Steel DH bike collaboration prototype Fort William Scotland . downhill mountain bike world championships .

Turner admits erring on the side of the caution with this, having never designed a downhill bike before, but points out: “They [Frameworks] had to add one to the V1 alloy frames to get them to last.”</p>\n<h2>Brook Macdonald’s Mondraker Summum prototype</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Brook MacDonald 's Mondraker Summum DH bike .

August 2023\" title=\"Brook MacDonald 's Mondraker Summum DH bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The rear shock now appears to attach directly to the rear triangle.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>There’s a new suspension setup, designed to get the best from modern coil-sprung dampers, with the shock now attaching to the rear triangle, not the lower link.</p>\n<p>Plenty of adjustability is built in, too – you can change the reach of both sizes by 21mm and the chainstay length by 10mm, bolt on different bottom bracket shells to change BB height and location, and flip a chip in the shock mount to tweak the initial leverage ratio.</p>\n<p>Bolt-in weights can also be added, to fine-tune the balance of the bike. These slide into the base of the down tube.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Brook MacDonald 's Mondraker Summum DH bike . Fort William Scotland . downhill mountain bike world championships . August 2023\" title=\"Brook MacDonald 's Mondraker Summum DH bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike features Mondraker’s iconic Forward geometry.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>“The last bike was built with more of a focus on pedalling,” says Ireland. “We need to make sure it pedals well, but it’s more important that it’s balanced.” Geometry is similar to the previous Summum, although the team are taking advantage of the extra adjustability to run the BB higher, at 350mm, compared to 340mm.</p>\n<h2>Bernard Kerr’s Pivot Phoenix prototype</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bernard Kerr's PIvot Phoenix prototype DH bike .

Links can be swapped to make the suspension more progressive or more linear.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bernard Kerr's PIvot Phoenix prototype DH bike .

He’s running some special kit, too, including custom pedal pins, a new fork damper (which can’t be bought yet) and a WTB Gravelier saddle, which is aimed at gravel riders, but he likes because of its short back.</p>\n<h2>Aimi Kenyon’s Santa Cruz V10</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Aimi Kenyon 's Santa Cruz V10 DH bike with a Iron Bru colour scheme / paint job .

This enables the chain to move a small amount independently of the chainring, to help combat pedal kickback and keep the suspension super-smooth.</p>\n<p>Atherton used this for the first time in Lenzerheide and is enthusiastic about its benefits, even if her brother Dan isn’t sold on the idea.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rachel Atherton 's Atherton Downhill .200 DH bike .

This was on the basis that it isn’t well-suited to the Fort William track, once renowned as one of the roughest on the circuit.</p>\n<p>The teams have access to a version that can be attached or removed, but performance manager Fabien Barel says on production bikes it’ll be built-in, albeit adjustable.</p>\n<p>The tartan design on Tahnee’s frame is carried over onto her Fizik saddle – a nice touch.</p>\n<h2>Jordan Williams’ Specialized Demo</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jordan Williams ' Specialized Demo DH bike Fort William Scotland . downhill mountain bike world championships .
