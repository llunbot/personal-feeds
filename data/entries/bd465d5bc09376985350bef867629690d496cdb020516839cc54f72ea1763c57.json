And it might be working. The plaintiffs in the case have reached a settlement with Google parent company Alphabet, which will spend a boatload of cash on \"comprehensive\" reforms. The goal is to steer Google away from the kind of anticompetitive practices that got it in hot water.</p>\n<p>Under the terms of the settlement, obtained by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/InreAlphabetIncShareholderDerivativeLitigationDocketNo321cv09388N/1?doc_id=X6L5I3F7H479DQB4STTU3JAG8JV\">Bloomberg Law</a>, Alphabet will spend $500 million over the next 10 years on systematic reforms. The company will have to form a board-level committee devoted to overseeing the company's regulatory compliance and antitrust risk, a rarity for US firms. This group will report directly to CEO Sundar Pichai. There will also be reforms at other levels of the company that allow employees to identify potential legal pitfalls before they affect the company. Google has also agreed to preserve communications. Google's propensity to use auto-deleting chats drew condemnation from several judges overseeing its antitrust cases.</p>\n<p>The agreement still needs approval from US District Judge Rita Lin in San Francisco, but that's mainly a formality at this point. Naturally, Alphabet does not admit to any wrongdoing under the terms of the settlement, but it may have to pay tens of millions in legal fees on top of the promised $500 million investment.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/google-settles-shareholder-lawsuit-will-spend-500m-on-being-less-evil/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/google-settles-shareholder-lawsuit-will-spend-500m-on-being-less-evil/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bd465d5bc09376985350bef867629690d496cdb020516839cc54f72ea1763c57","category":"Tech"}
