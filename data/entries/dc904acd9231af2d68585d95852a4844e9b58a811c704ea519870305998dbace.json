He said there is increasing discussion within the supply chain about a foldable iPhone launching in late 2026 to early 2027, but he believes that the device's higher starting price would unsurprisingly limit sales volume.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this month, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that the first foldable iPhone would be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/\">priced between $2,000 and $2,500</a>, so multiple analysts agree that the device will cost at least a few thousand dollars. Kuo believes there could still be strong demand for the foldable iPhone despite its higher price, however, provided that the device's quality meets expectations. For example, Apple releasing a foldable smartphone without a visible crease in the screen would be a major breakthrough.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo said the first foldable iPhone would feature a 7.8-inch inner display, a 5.5-inch outer display, two rear cameras, one front camera,   a Touch ID power button instead of Face ID, and a high-density battery. He expects the device to be as thin as 4.5mm when unfolded, and between 9mm and 9.5mm when folded. He expects the device to have a titanium exterior, but the hinge would use a mix of titanium and stainless steel.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo said the foldable iPhone would enter mass production in the fourth quarter of 2026.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the foldable iPhone at least a year and a half away, keep in mind that this pricing estimate is surely just an educated guess.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/barclays/\">Barclays</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/foldable-iphone-price-estimate/\">Apple's First Foldable iPhone Estimated to Cost Nearly Twice as Much as iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-first-foldable-iphone-estimated-to-cost-nearly-twice-as-much-as-iphone-16-pro-max.2453312/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dc904acd9231af2d68585d95852a4844e9b58a811c704ea519870305998dbace","category":"Apple"}
