It's \"a massive change for the video game industry,\" Schreier writes, which seems almost restrained, given Kotick's longevity and recent history. Several employees <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1712788620220784649\">Schreier spoke to</a> are \"very excited for this deal to go through,\" specifically to see <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1712790666453885373\">leadership change</a>.</p>\n<p>Kotick, who has led Activision for more than 30 years and orchestrated its merger with Blizzard, had considered stepping down in late 2021. Following <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/ca-state-agency-sues-activision-blizzard-alleges-discrimination-against-women/\">a lawsuit from the state of California</a> alleging a \"frat boy culture\" rife with pay disparity and sexual harassment, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680\">a Wall Street Journal report</a> alleged that Kotick failed to act on hundreds of abuse allegations within the company and also kept the company's board of directors in the dark. Activision was also <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/shareholders-sue-activision-blizzard-for-withholding-harassment-info/\">sued by its shareholders</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/state-treasurers-join-chorus-looking-for-change-at-activision-blizzard/\">pressured by state treasurers</a> over its secrecy and responses regarding the California lawsuit. All of this led to an <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/11/after-bombshell-report-activision-employees-walk-out-demand-ceo-resign/\">employee walkout and calls for Kotick's resignation</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976154#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976154&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fc89399954c9025f5ddac43fb33d8c05c3b31e3abd86032e77e075394ef5325b","category":"Tech"}
