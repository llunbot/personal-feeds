It also provides new insights about what to expect from 2022's iPhone lineup.</p>\n<p>Drawing from supply line sources, the note says the materials change is coming in 2022 and that Foxconn will be Apple's exclusive supplier for the titanium components. The Pro model phones from that year are likely to use a titanium alloy, which is stronger and more resistant to scratches than the stainless steel used in current iPhone models.</p>\n<p>While the analyst report does not specify, it's very likely that we're talking about the metallic band around the edge of the iPhone, not the front and the back. The front is expected to still be glass, and given that Apple continues to introduce new MagSafe and wireless charging products and features, we expect the back to remain glass as well.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1783057#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1783057&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e0ee45c32d8885b88f560b3ba41cb31494f255999e810f6e71f5b181850845f0","category":"Tech"}
