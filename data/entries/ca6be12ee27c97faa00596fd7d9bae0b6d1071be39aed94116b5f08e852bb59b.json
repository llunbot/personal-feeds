On Monday, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2412089/ios-18-1-beta-release-date-apple-intelligence.html\">first beta of iOS 18.1 </a>featuring <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a> was released along with updates to all of the current operating systems that patched <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2412437/macos-sonoma-14-6-ventura-13-6-8-monterey-12-7-6-security-updates.html\">scores of security flaws</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But hidden among the things we also have some clues as to what’s coming next. As <a href=\"https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1818107277846700490\">spotted by @aaronp613 on X</a> (formerly Twitter), the macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta includes numerous references to unreleased devices that will arrive later this year and early next. Among them are iPhones, iPads, and Macs that will arrive soon. Here are the model identifier codes contained in the code:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPhone</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 17, 1</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 17, 2</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 17, 3</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 17, 4</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 18, 1</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 18, 2</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 18, 3</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 18, 4 </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPad</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad 17, 1</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad 17, 2</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad 17, 3</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad 17, 4</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mac</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mac16, 3</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac16, 5</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac16, 6</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac16, 7</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac16, 8</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac16, 9</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac17, 1</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac17, 2</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The device code types don’t tell us a ton about what’s coming, but we can glean a few things. The iPhones almost certainly refer to the iPhone 16 and iPhone 17, since the iPhone SE will likely have the same identifier as the iPhone 16 (iPhone 17, 5). The iPad likely refers to variations of the iPad mini 7 and perhaps 11th gen iPad (Wi-Fi and cellular).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Macs are a little less clear, though we can narrow it down. The Macs released so far in 2024 all have identifiers that begin with “15,” so it’s possible these models won’t arrive until 2025 and 2026. Otherwise, they will likely all be running M4 chips despite several Macs still running M2 chips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to launch its next round of products in the fall, beginning with the iPhone 16 in September. Mac events are often held in October, though it’s possible Apple doesn’t hold an event until the spring.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ca6be12ee27c97faa00596fd7d9bae0b6d1071be39aed94116b5f08e852bb59b","category":"Apple"}
