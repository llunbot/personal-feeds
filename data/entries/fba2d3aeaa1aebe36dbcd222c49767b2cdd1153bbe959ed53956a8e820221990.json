The move comes as some companies like Meta <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/the-first-gpt-4-class-ai-model-anyone-can-download-has-arrived-llama-405b/\">release</a> trained AI language model weights and code with usage restrictions while <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/the-first-gpt-4-class-ai-model-anyone-can-download-has-arrived-llama-405b/\">using</a> the \"open source\" label. This has sparked intense <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/meta-launches-llama-2-an-open-source-ai-model-that-allows-commercial-applications/\">debates</a> among free-software advocates about what truly constitutes \"open source\" in the context of AI.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, Meta's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/meta-releases-chatgpt-like-ai-site-and-open-weights-llama-3-model/\">Llama 3</a> model, while freely available, doesn't meet the traditional open source criteria as <a href=\"https://opensource.org/osd\">defined</a> by the OSI for software because it <a href=\"https://llama.meta.com/llama3/license/\">imposes license restrictions</a> on usage due to company size or what type of content is produced with the model. The AI image generator <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/flux-this-new-ai-image-generator-is-eerily-good-at-creating-human-hands/\">Flux</a> is another \"open\" model that is not truly open source. Because of this type of ambiguity, we've typically described AI models that include code or weights with restrictions or lack accompanying training data with alternative terms like \"open-weights\" or \"source-available.\"</p>\n<p>To address the issue formally, the OSI—which is well-known for its advocacy for open software standards—has assembled a group of about 70 participants, including researchers, lawyers, policymakers, and activists. Representatives from major tech companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon also joined the effort. The group's <a href=\"https://opensource.org/deepdive/drafts/open-source-ai-definition-draft-v-0-0-9\">current draft</a> (version 0.0.9) definition of open source AI emphasizes \"four fundamental freedoms\" reminiscent of those <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Free_Software_Definition\">defining free software</a>: giving users of the AI system permission to use it for any purpose without permission, study how it works, modify it for any purpose, and share with or without modifications.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045225#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045225&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fba2d3aeaa1aebe36dbcd222c49767b2cdd1153bbe959ed53956a8e820221990","category":"Tech"}
