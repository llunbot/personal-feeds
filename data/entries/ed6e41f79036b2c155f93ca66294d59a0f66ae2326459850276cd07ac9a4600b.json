Hundreds of thousands of Pi boards were still being manufactured every month, but many <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/still-cant-buy-a-raspberry-pi-board-things-arent-getting-better-anytime-soon/\">were going to commercial buyers</a> rather than retailers and end users.</p>\n\n<p>More recently, those manufacturing numbers have climbed from 400,000 monthly units to 600,000 to 800,000 to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/ceo-raspberry-pi-inventory-to-hit-1m-units-monthly-starting-in-july/\">1 million</a>, a level that Upton says can be sustained \"for as long as is necessary to clear our remaining customer backlogs and return to free availability.\"</p>\n<p>We're now seeing very early signs that supply is returning to normal, at least for some Pi models. UK-based Pi reseller Pimoroni <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pimoroni/status/1686730707643588608\">announced today</a> that it was lifting some purchase limitations on 2GB and 4GB Raspberry Pi 4 boards and Pi Zero W boards (not, apparently, the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-crams-pi-3-parts-into-the-same-tiny-board/\">more recent Pi Zero 2 W</a>). The rpilocator stock tracker account has also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rpilocator/status/1686046927568203776\">noted</a> that its number of automated stock alerts has decreased recently \"because Pis are staying in stock longer,\" noting that Pimoroni and <a href=\"https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b?variant=20064052674622\">The Pi Hut</a> had (and still have) multiple Pi 4 variants in stock.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958301#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958301&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ed6e41f79036b2c155f93ca66294d59a0f66ae2326459850276cd07ac9a4600b","category":"Tech"}
