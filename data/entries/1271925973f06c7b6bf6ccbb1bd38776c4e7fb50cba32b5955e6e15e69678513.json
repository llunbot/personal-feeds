Everybody with plans to build one hasn't had a reactor design approved, while nobody is planning to use any of the approved designs. This follows a period in which only three new reactors have entered service since 1990. Despite its extremely low carbon footprint, nuclear power appears to be dead in the water.</p>\n<p>On Friday, the Trump administration issued a series of executive orders intended to revive the US nuclear industry. These include plans to streamline the reactor approval process and boost the construction of experimental reactors by the Department of Energy. But they also contain language that's inconsistent with other administration priorities and fundamentally misunderstands the use of nuclear power. Plus, some timelines might be, shall we say, unrealistic: three new experimental reactors reaching criticality in just over a year.</p>\n<h2>Slow nukes</h2>\n<p>The heyday of nuclear plant construction in the US was in the 1970s and '80s. But the 1979 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident\">partial meltdown</a> at the Three Mile Island plant soured public sentiment toward nuclear power. This also came at a time when nuclear plants typically generated <a href=\"https://nuclear.duke-energy.com/2021/05/18/capacity-factor-it-s-a-measure-of-reliability\">only half of their rated capacity</a>, making them an expensive long-term bet. As a result, plans for many plants, including some that were partially constructed, were canceled.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/trump-signs-executive-orders-meant-to-resurrect-us-nuclear-power/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/trump-signs-executive-orders-meant-to-resurrect-us-nuclear-power/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1271925973f06c7b6bf6ccbb1bd38776c4e7fb50cba32b5955e6e15e69678513","category":"Tech"}
