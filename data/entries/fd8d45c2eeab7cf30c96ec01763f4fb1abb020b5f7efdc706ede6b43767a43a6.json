In the latest hit against physical media fans, LG has discontinued its remaining Blu-ray players. However, this doesn't spell the end for Blu-rays, which, in at least some categories, are seeing growing interest.</p>\n<p>LG has no plans to make more Blu-ray players, <a href=\"https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1733902062\">FlatpanelsHD</a> reported on Wednesday. Its most recent players, the <a href=\"http://www.lg.com/us/blu-ray-dvd-players/lg-ubk90-blu-ray-player\">UBK90</a> and <a href=\"http://www.lg.com/us/blu-ray-dvd-players/lg-ubk80-blu-ray-player\">UBK80</a>, came out in 2018 and are no longer available for purchase on LG’s website. You can still find them at third-party retailers, but when stock runs out, LG won’t be replenishing. Trying to access LG's \"Blu-ray &amp; DVD Players\" webpage now results in a redirect to LG's 4K TVs. We can take a hint, LG.</p>\n<p>FlatpanelsHD spoke with LG Korea, which reportedly didn’t commit to a permanent exit from Blu-ray players. But for the foreseeable future, the company won’t be selling a type of device that it hasn’t updated in almost seven years.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/the-optical-disc-onslaught-continues-with-lg-quitting-blu-ray-players/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/the-optical-disc-onslaught-continues-with-lg-quitting-blu-ray-players/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fd8d45c2eeab7cf30c96ec01763f4fb1abb020b5f7efdc706ede6b43767a43a6","category":"Tech"}
