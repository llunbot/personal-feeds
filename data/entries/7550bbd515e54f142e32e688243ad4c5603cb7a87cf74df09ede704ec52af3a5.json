Apple offers MLS and MLB games through the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>+ subscription service because it has partnerships with those leagues. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe update adds SharePlay integration so that Vision Pro wearers can view live sporting events together, including multiple games at the same time. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlong with the new Multiview and SharePlay features, visionOS 2.2 introduces two new Mac Virtual Display aspect ratios, including 21:9 (wide) and 32:9 (ultrawide), which Apple says is equivalent to two 5K monitors side by side.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther new features include the option to route audio from the Mac to the Vision Pro and support for viewing spatial photos and videos that are embedded on web pages. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nvisionOS 2.2 is expected to launch on Monday, December 9. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/\">visionOS 2</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/05/visionos-2-2-multiview-support/\">visionOS 2.2 Adds Support for Watching Five Sports Games at Once With Multiview</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/visionos-2-2-adds-support-for-watching-five-sports-games-at-once-with-multiview.2444703/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7550bbd515e54f142e32e688243ad4c5603cb7a87cf74df09ede704ec52af3a5","category":"Apple"}
