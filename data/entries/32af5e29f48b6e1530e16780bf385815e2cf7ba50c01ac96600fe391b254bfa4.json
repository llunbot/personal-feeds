The strain of mice, nicknamed “tail short,” has been faithfully bred ever since, in the hope that one day, research might reveal what was the matter with them.</p>\n<p>After more than 60 years, researchers finally got their answer, when Maria Barna, a developmental biologist then at the University of California San Francisco, found that the mice had a genetic mutation that caused a protein to disappear from their ribosomes—the places in cells where proteins are made.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/when-ribosomes-go-rogue/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/when-ribosomes-go-rogue/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim Vernimmen, Knowable Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"32af5e29f48b6e1530e16780bf385815e2cf7ba50c01ac96600fe391b254bfa4","category":"Tech"}
