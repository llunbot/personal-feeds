This was the fourth time a Rocket Lab mission has failed in 41 flights.</p>\n<p>In a statement, Rocket Lab said it is \"working closely\" with the Federal Aviation Administration and supporting agencies as the company begins an investigation into the cause of the failure. While Rocket Lab launches most of its missions from New Zealand, the company is headquartered in the United States, giving the FAA regulatory oversight authority over failure investigations.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969213#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969213&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6aebf61efa1417e863be7704b0cc73664d967c5b846bb3032c9e5f04c048bdae","category":"Tech"}
