Over the course of a few months, I rode the shit out of it in Los Angeles, where I was living at the time, and couldn’t get enough of it. As someone who lives metal bikes and loves riding trails, I hadn’t fully migrated to a full suspension chassis because I didn’t like the way the widely-available carbon models rode. The Murmur changed that for me. I <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/starling-murmur-review/\" target=\"_blank\">reviewed the Murmur in April 2019</a> and immediately bought a V2 Murmur. </em></p>\n<p><em>Now living in Santa Fe, with arguably more technical terrain, I haven’t been able to put down the <a href=\"https://www.starlingcycles.com/bikes/murmur/\" target=\"_blank\">Starling Cycles Murmur</a>; taking it high into the Sangre Mountains and beyond, this steel full-suspension bike really changed my perspective on the potential ride quality of full-suspension mountain bikes.

This is evidence of Joe and the Starling Cycles team’s relentless pursuit of producing the best bike frames–check out his interview at <a href=\"https://www.pinkbike.com/news/podcast-steel-bikes-29ers-and-prototypes-with-joe-mcewan-of-starling-cycles.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pinkbike</a> for an in-depth read. Here’s a rough breakdown:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>V1 frames were built by Joe in the UK with UK swingarms and used a 12mm stainless main pivot axle.</li>\n<li>V2 used a UK-made front triangle with Taiwanese swingarms with bearings in cups fitted into the main frame.</li>\n<li><span>V3</span> is a new version. The front triangle is UK-made with Reynolds 853 tubing and the rear swingarm is made in Taiwan, with the cast main pivot bearing in the rear swingarm.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The V3 also features a revised gusset shape at the head tube and the all-new stainless shock mount is soldered directly to the downtube. An aluminum insert in the seat tube stops seatpost binding due to galvanic corrosion. This is also typical for custom and production-built frames to standardize seat post diameters. Think of it as a permanent shim to bring the Murmur to a 31.6⌀ seatpost that also keeps the post from getting corroded in the steel seat tube.</p>\n<p>I was content with my V2 Murmur and <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/starling-murmur-29er-review/\" target=\"_blank\">repeatedly said</a> it was “all the bike I need,” but Joe laid out some changes that made the V3 sound even better…</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-51.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-51.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-51.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-51.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-51.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-51.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-51.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-51.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2204\" height=\"1240\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-12-at-2.06.15-PM.png?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-12-at-2.06.15-PM.png?w=2204&amp;quality=75 2204w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-12-at-2.06.15-PM.png?resize=1024,576&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-12-at-2.06.15-PM.png?resize=2000,1125&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-12-at-2.06.15-PM.png?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-12-at-2.06.15-PM.png?resize=1800,1013&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-12-at-2.06.15-PM.png?resize=1335,751&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-12-at-2.06.15-PM.png?resize=700,394&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-12-at-2.06.15-PM.png?resize=1536,864&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-12-at-2.06.15-PM.png?resize=2048,1152&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<h3>Geometrically Speaking</h3>\n<p>The V3 Murmur underwent a few geometry tweaks, including steepening the seat angle by a full degree steeper (78°) and a raising the bottom bracket to come in at a -34mm drop (both metrics are unsagged). This solved one slight nitpick from the V2, as I’d found it prone to striking on pedaly-flat-ish rocky terrain. And, these adjustments made climbing steep singletrack all the easier.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-5.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-5.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-5.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-5.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-5.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-5.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>What’s interesting about the V3 is how you can now run two different shocks on it thanks to the new downtube shock mount:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>135mm shock for short travel</li>\n<li>150mm shock for long travel</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I liked how the 140mm felt on my V2 Murmur, so I opted for the short travel version. This also helps with how pedalable the bike is across town riding to the trails and how well it climbs. More on that later.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-7.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-7.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-7.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-7.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-7.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-7.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-7.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Build Kit</h3>\n<p>While Starling offers complete build kits, I built my V3 from the ground up, swapping over some parts from my V2 (that is now owned by Andy Karr!) while also incorporating some flashy new bits.

These just came out last April, and I’ve put them through the rock wringer here in Santa Fe since receiving them to review. Now hear me out. Wheel reviews are tough and usually contingent upon three main qualities: maintenance, tubeless setup, and ride quality.

This proved to be especially true on the rear, which I usually run at 15psi with a tire insert. The E300 wheels utilize a hollow bead wall, which helps with pinch flats and overall wheel strength. When the wheels came in, I was juggling a lot with work, so I didn’t pay much attention to the material of the rims.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-31.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-31.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-31.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-31.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-31.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-31.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-31.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-31.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>The V3 Murmur, like the V2 Murmur clears an aggressive 29×2.6″ tire, as all trail bikes should!</em></p>\n<p>After a few rides, I kept saying to myself how good they felt and how Industry Nine finally nailed the carbon layup on its wheels. Well… these are <em>aluminum</em> rims, and to be honest, they ride much smoother than any carbon wheel I’ve tried out over the past several months, even when comparing them to the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/forge_and_bond_us_made_carbon_rims/\" target=\"_blank\">CSS Composites rims</a> that Chris King and Revel use.

Ergonomics, power, and relatively low maintenance have put these high on my list of all-time favorites.</p>\n<p><em>My only note is that when the rear pads begin to wear too much, the pistons are hard to align, so you must stay on top of replacing your pads when needed or else your rotors will kiss the calipers.</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/JoshAtalaya-8.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/JoshAtalaya-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/JoshAtalaya-8.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/JoshAtalaya-8.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/JoshAtalaya-8.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/JoshAtalaya-8.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/JoshAtalaya-8.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/JoshAtalaya-8.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Cockpit, Etc.</strong></p>\n<p>Going from the V2 to the V3, I made a pretty significant change to the cockpit by going shorter and wider: I swapped out a 35mm stem to a 50mm and replaced the 800mm bar with an 840mm, vis-a-vis the Mountain Goat titanium bullmoose I bought from <a href=\"https://firstflightbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">First Flight Bikes</a>. I wanted to be stretched out a little more since I’m between an XL and XXL in terms of reach numbers, and I opted for more bar width to make descending feel more in-control. I have a 46″ chest and wide shoulders with long arms, so I’m constantly fiddling with bar width and sweep profile with my trail bikes. Right now, these bars really hit the nail on the head in terms of all-day comfort and control.

It doesn’t matter if you have a steel road, gravel, hardtail, or rigid MTB, a properly engineered steel frame is going to <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/black-cat-bicycles-swami-rigid-29er-mtb-review/\" target=\"_blank\">“dance” with you</a> when you apply force to it. Unlike carbon models, which are marketed as being stiff for power transfer, a steel bike is all about smoothing out the ride quality.</p>\n<p>This applies to full suspension bikes even moreso, I’d argue, as there are more moving parts to tune, and with the simple linkage design found in single-pivot bikes, these moments of tunability are much easier to discern in ride quality and characteristics. I can wax poetic all day about the ride characteristics of steel over carbon, but I’ve found steel excels in two moments specifically: rock gardens and cornering; two of my joys while descending.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-9.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-9.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-9.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-9.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-9.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-9.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-9.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-9.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Descending</strong></p>\n<p>With a big, stiff carbon bike, when you hit a rock garden, the bike wants to get all chattery as it reverberates across the terrain in an attempt to hold its line, relying on tire pressure and suspension settings to “soften” the ride. On a steel bike,  the frame itself smooths out rocky trails and flexes as you adjust your weight to this uneven terrain. Tire pressure and suspension settings just add to this experience. It’s a big reason why I feel like steel full suspensions ride so uniquely.</p>\n<p>People often grab the bike and step on one pedal, pushing into the bottom bracket, before commenting on how much the frame flexes. My question to them is “why is that a bad thing?” When you’re out of the saddle, charging, your force is being applied vertically on the pedals more than on the side, so you’re not losing power or momentum from some light swaying of the bottom bracket shell.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/JoshJohnWinsor-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/JoshJohnWinsor-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/JoshJohnWinsor-1.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/JoshJohnWinsor-1.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/JoshJohnWinsor-1.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/JoshJohnWinsor-1.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/JoshJohnWinsor-1.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/JoshJohnWinsor-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>However, when you side-load the bike into and out of turns, this flexibility allows you to snap the bike around with predictable results. My favorite thing to do on the Murmur is a left-hand jump on a local trail that lands you into a sharp, left-hook turn. Hitting the jump just right snaps you into a spring-loading position just before you fire out of the landing in the corner like a catapult. Part of this is the tubing spec; <a href=\"https://www.reynoldstechnology.biz/materials/steel/steel-853/\" target=\"_blank\">Reynolds 853</a> is a great, well-rounded tubeset. And the other part is the tubing diameters, particularly the downtube, which Starling specs as a 38.1mm diameter. Even just a gentle turn with a delayed “snap” of the rear end is a truly unique ride quality. This allows for the frame to move under my weight in a way that I’ve never felt on a carbon bike.</p>\n<p><em>The only other steel full suspension bike I’ve ridden that rides similarly to the Murmur is the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/chromag-darco-29er-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Chromag Darco</a>, which also specs a 38.1mm diameter downtube from seamless CroMo tubing. The <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/reeb-cycles-sst-full-suspension-review/\" target=\"_blank\">REEB SST</a> specs a 44.5mm downtube, resulting in a much stiffer bike. So if you’re not into flex, the SST might be your best choice for a steel bike. Both the Darco and SST also weigh 35 lbs as I reviewed them in a size XL.</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-8.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-8.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-8.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-8.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-8.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-8.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-8.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>If I rode a lot of bike parks, I’d probably want a bigger downtube for stability at high speeds, and any potential trail impacts at those high speeds, but on our primitive trails, the smaller diameter tube lend a light, lively and responsive ride quality. It’s one of those sensations you must try for yourself. What I will say is if you’re into a stiff bike that rides on rails, you’re probably going to prefer a carbon bike over a more flexy ride that dances with you on descents.</p>\n<p>Yet, as well as the Murmur descends, it climbs even better…</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-6.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-6.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-6.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-6.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-6.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-6.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-6.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Ascending</strong></p>\n<p>The number one reason I’ll often take my hardtail out in lieu of my full suspension is climbing. If I’m doing a big, long ride in our mountains, having a rear shock and five extra pounds on the build can quickly tire me out. Plus, only having one water bottle on the Murmur is kind of a bummer if I don’t want to ride with a pack. However, with the V3’s geometry tweaks–mainly the 1º steeper seat tube and slightly higher BB–climbing got a bit easier. Now, when I hit a steep section of trail, I’ll scooch forward even more on the saddle, and dig in deeper. The bike practically walks itself up steep switchbacks and tight turns.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-43.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-43.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-43.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-43.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-43.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-43.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-43.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Starling-Murmur-V3-43.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/JoshJohnWinsor-8.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/JoshJohnWinsor-8.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/JoshJohnWinsor-8.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/JoshJohnWinsor-8.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/JoshJohnWinsor-8.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /></p>\n<p>This is another reason I wanted a longer stem on this build: so I had more room to move forward. The closer you are to being over the bottom bracket shell, the more efficient each pedal stroke is, and the closer you are to the front of the bike, resulting in better rear traction as well. If you get too far forward–like you do when you’re out of the saddle–you can lose weight on the rear wheel and spin out.</p>\n<p>A nice, steep seat angle keeps you planted in the saddle, brings you closer to the front wheel/bottom bracket, and allows for more comfortable climbing. The V3 tweaks have resulted in me taking the “big bike” out on longer rides moreso than any other springtime here in the Southern Rockies.</p>\n<p><em>Some people say a steep seat angle is an ass-hatchet on traversing terrain, but remember, you’ve got a rear shock to smooth that out too. I will agree that steeper seat angles on hardtails can be kind of brutal though…</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-10.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-10.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-10.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-10.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-10.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-10.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-10.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/John-10.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Murmur Out</h3>\n<p>K.I.S.S. = Keep it simple, stupid. Single pivot suspension design, when engineered correctly, is not only easier to maintain (it takes 10 minutes to swap bearings on the Murmur) but, when paired with modern suspension, can be just as tunable as more complex suspension setups found on more popular carbon models. One of the main benefits of a steel frame is the frame itself absorbs much of the trail chatter, so the suspension just acts as a smoothing agent to an already buttery ride.</p>\n<p>This new Murmur just proves that with the right kinetic engineering, proper geometry, and tube selection, a steel full suspension bike can offer the same, if not better, performance and ride quality as a carbon bike. The way Joe and his team have set up this simple single-pivot design, there is little to no effect on the suspension from hard braking (anti-rise), yet with the new geometry tweaks, the Mumur climbs even better than before and still holds its own on descents.</p>\n<p>If you want a big, 160/135mm bike that pedals like an XC counterpart and aren’t concerned with weight (my XL built as shown comes in at 35 lbs on the nose), then the Murmur might be up your alley for all-mountain exploits.</p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Engineering to flex while maintaining strength for rough riding.</li>\n<li>Beautiful lines and details.</li>\n<li>Multiple rear shock travel and fork travel options.</li>\n<li>29×2.6″ clearance.</li>\n<li>US distribution makes ordering a Starling more affordable (details below).</li>\n<li>Beautiful colors.</li>\n<li>Steel will last a lifetime.</li>\n<li>Not feeling beaten up or sore after long descents.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Not as light as carbon but still competitive in weight compared to similar travel aluminum and carbon bikes.</li>\n<li>Having to explain to people on the trail that no, this isn’t a 1990s bike.
