The first of the crew rotation missions covered in the NASA contract extension <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/08/four-people-from-four-different-nations-ride-spacex-rocket-into-orbit/\">launched on August 26</a>, and the spacecraft is currently docked at the ISS.</p>\n<p>The mission that launched last month, designated Crew-7, is SpaceX's seventh operational crew rotation flight to the space station. The four-person crew that arrived at the station on Crew-7 will live and work aboard the orbiting outpost until February, replacing the Crew-6 mission that returned to Earth early Monday.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965318#p3\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965318&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"befc3b41fb832aa9ec6f8e2cd5e7a146ab8e189b4c945000f5e9b1946e35f998","category":"Tech"}
