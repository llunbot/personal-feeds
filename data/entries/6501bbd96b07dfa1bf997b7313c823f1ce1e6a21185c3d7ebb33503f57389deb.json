We think so</p>\n<div>\n      <p> It could be bias talking but this year’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/913/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain</a> felt as if it was one of the best races of the season. In eight days from Penzance to Aberdeen, it had everything.</p>\n<p>We had spectacular racing, inspiring riders, memorable scenery and heartwarming stories. We had 12-year-old Xander Graham taking a bottle from Pascal Eenkhoorn and joining the Jumbo-Visma team. There was that summit finish on Great Orme; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JumboVismaRoad/status/1436985304548786178?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Cavendish’s son Casper being completely starstruck by Wout van Aert</a>; Robin Carpernter’s solo heroics for Rally Cycling; <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/10082/why-this-team-rode-bright-green-front-wheels-at-the-tour-of-britain\" target=\"_blank\">Global 6 Cycling racing for refugees</a>...</p>\n<p>After two years without top level racing on British shores, this was quite some return. Everything from the race’s parcours to the organiser’s social media hit the mark.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/tutorials/3207/how-to-change-your-saddle-height\">Watch: How to set and change your saddle height </a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/2127/buyers-guide-best-saddle-bags\">Buyer's guide: Best saddle bags</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/10101/how-to-watch-uci-world-championships\">How to watch the UCI World Championships 2021: Full schedule for live TV and highlights</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nThe eventual overall victory went to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jumbo-visma\">Jumbo-Visma</a>’s Van Aert, a phenom who bludgeoned his way to four stage wins out eight, firmly cementing himself as favourite for the rainbow jersey at next week’s World Championships on home territory in Leuven, Belgium.</p>\n<p>On paper, Van Aert’s victory seems dominant but he was pushed close all week by young Ethan Hayter, the South Londoner from Ineos Grenadiers who is fast becoming one of the sport’s best young prospects. Their week-long battle was one usually reserved for the very biggest races.</p>\n<p>\nBelow, we have compiled the best images of last week’s race as captured by SWPix:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/10083/tour-of-britain-2021-best-of-gallery#4\"><p><span>Image 5 of</span> 38</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/09/tour-of-britain-gallery-4.jpg?itok=QJ0v-e6e\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 5 of </span>38</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/10083/tour-of-britain-2021-best-of-gallery\">Tour of Britain 2021 Best Of gallery </a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>13 Sep 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10083%2Ftour-of-britain-2021-best-of-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Tour%20of%20Britain%202021%20Best%20Of%20gallery%20%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10083%2Ftour-of-britain-2021-best-of-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Tour%20of%20Britain%202021%20Best%20Of%20gallery%20%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10083%2Ftour-of-britain-2021-best-of-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Tour%20of%20Britain%202021%20Best%20Of%20gallery%20&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10083%2Ftour-of-britain-2021-best-of-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/10083/tour-of-britain-2021-best-of-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 38</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/09/tour-of-britain-gallery-6.jpg?itok=K4NxhaoS\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"6501bbd96b07dfa1bf997b7313c823f1ce1e6a21185c3d7ebb33503f57389deb","category":"Cycling"}
