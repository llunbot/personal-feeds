Google's second self-branded smartwatch is sporting a modest update, with the same design as the first version, a new SoC, and a skin temperature sensor.</p>\n<p>As<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/report-the-pixel-watch-2-dumps-samsung-exynos-socs-for-qualcomm/\"> previously reported</a>, the <a href=\"https://howl.me/ckIM8MfX12w\" target=\"_blank\">Pixel Watch 2</a> is jumping from the Exynos SoC of the first watch to Team Qualcomm, and now this is shipping the Qualcomm Snapdragon W5. That's sort of an upgrade but not a huge one. Both the new and old chips run four Cortex A53 CPUsâ€”the Exynos 9110 in the Pixel Watch 1 was built on a 10 nm while this is taking a big jump to 4nm. Any CPU upgrade is nice, but the Cortex A53 is 11 years old, so it still feels like Qualcomm is building these things in a cave.</p>\n\n<p>The Qualcomm chip should bring a better modem if you're getting the LTE version, which is still <a href=\"https://howl.me/ckIM8MfX12w\" target=\"_blank\">$400</a>, while the Wi-Fi only is <a href=\"https://howl.me/ckIMZ1W3Gvp\" target=\"_blank\">$350</a>. The rest of the spec sheet is mostly the same: 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and IP68 dust and water resistance.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972958#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972958&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d84492ea24324445f3b25d6bd695391e003b2fe9ad6215c2640c43437e657d65","category":"Tech"}
