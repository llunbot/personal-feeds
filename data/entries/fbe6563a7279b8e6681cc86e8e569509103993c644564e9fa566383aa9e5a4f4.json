The company is now selling <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamdeckrefurbished\">official, certified-refurbished Steam Decks</a> with the same one-year warranty as new models at prices that are between $80 and $130 lower, depending on the configuration you want.</p>\n<p>A basic Steam Deck with 64GB of eMMC storage costs $319 refurbished, compared to $399 new. The 256GB model runs $419 refurbished, compared to $529 new. And the 512GB model costs $519, compared to $649 new. All have the same Zen 2-based AMD CPU and integrated Radeon GPU, the same 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM, a charger, and a carrying case. Buying refurbished hardware directly from the manufacturer—from <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished\">Apple's refurbished site</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-us/dfh/lp/outlet\">Dell Outlet</a>, and other places—is usually a great way to get like-new hardware for less money without sacrificing software and warranty support as you might if you bought from a third party.</p>\n<p>If you want to save even more money on a Steam Deck, consider that <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/products/micron-2400-nvme-pcie-gen4-2230-ssd\">iFixit</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/02/framework-now-offers-steam-deck-sized-ssds-just-because-it-can/\">Framework</a>, and a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/its-getting-easier-to-buy-bigger-ssds-for-the-steam-deck-and-surface-pcs/\">growing number of SSD makers</a> are also releasing (physically) smaller SSD models that users can buy to save some money on storage or upgrade beyond that 512GB maximum.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959715#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959715&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fbe6563a7279b8e6681cc86e8e569509103993c644564e9fa566383aa9e5a4f4","category":"Tech"}
