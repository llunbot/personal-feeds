The brand has been making mountain bike hydration packs for many years, and the brand-new Hiline pack adds depth to the growing lineup. With an integrated spine protector, this new model is aimed squarely at enduro riders or anyone who appreciates a little extra back protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it a coincidence that this new pack shares its name with the iconic and notoriously technical Hiline trail in Sedona, Arizona? Maybe so, maybe not. Either way, that trail’s high-consequence descending would be a great place to be wearing a pack with a little extra spine protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-action-front.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-action-front.webp\" alt=\"A rider charging down a steep chute in the forest wearing the Hiline pack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-action-front.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-action-front-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-action-front-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-action-front-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-action-front-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-action-front-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-action-front-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Hiline is made for aggressive riders and terrain. (all photos/Deuter)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Deuter Hiline Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Deuter calls the new Hiline “<em>a trail-ready pack engineered specifically for enduro mountain biking.</em>” To create such an enduro-focused product, the brand worked with members of its pro team, which includes former DH champ Marcus Klausmann. Judging from the photos, we’re guessing maybe Rachel Atherton was involved, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal was to create a snug-fitting and compact pack with integrated spine protection using the latest 3D-printing technology, “<em>placing safety at the top of the list in a discipline where crashes are part of the sport.</em>” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Deuter partnered with Oechsler, a leading polymer specialist, to develop its new 3D-printed back protection system. While similar to the brand’s Airstripes back system, the foam pads are replaced by a 3D-printed, open-cell structure of EPU (Expanded Polyurethane). Deuter claims these new printed pads boost breathability and help reduce weight, comparatively.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-back-panel.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-back-panel.webp\" alt=\"The 3D-printed back panel of the Deuter Hiline pack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-back-panel.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-back-panel-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-back-panel-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-back-panel-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-back-panel-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-back-panel-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-back-panel-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The new 3D-printed back panel of the Hiline pack. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The pack also includes a separate spine protector made from an impact-absorbing memory foam. Deuter says this slim pad will conform to the rider’s back and provide multi-impact protection by returning to its original shape after a hit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With wide, vest-style shoulder straps and a broad, overlapping waistband, the Hiline looks like it should be pretty stable when smashing through rough, enduro terrain. That will be particularly helpful when fully loaded. And with 8- and 14-liter sizes, you’ll be able to carry quite a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bike_Hiline_Sideshot-9_Shift_25.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bike_Hiline_Sideshot-9_Shift_25.webp\" alt=\"removing a phone from the dedicated phone pocket on the Hiline pack.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bike_Hiline_Sideshot-9_Shift_25.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bike_Hiline_Sideshot-9_Shift_25-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bike_Hiline_Sideshot-9_Shift_25-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bike_Hiline_Sideshot-9_Shift_25-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bike_Hiline_Sideshot-9_Shift_25-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bike_Hiline_Sideshot-9_Shift_25-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bike_Hiline_Sideshot-9_Shift_25-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Hiline’s dedicated phone pocket looks pretty protective, too.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Deuter Hiline Features and Technologies</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>New Airstripes back system with 3D-printed, open-cell structure EPU spine protector</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Vest-style shoulder straps, adjustable elastic sternum strap and waist belt</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Volume: 14-liter or 8-liter</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Colour: Phosphor-black or Atlantic-raisin</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Designed for hydration systems up to 3 liters</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weight: 890g (14-liter), 870g (8-liter)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dimensions: 46 / 24 / 15cm (14-liter), 46 / 24 / 13cm (8-liter)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mobile phone pocket, pump attachment, full-face helmet holder, whistle, glasses storage system</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2-year warranty</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Made without PFAS, bluesign® certified product, Green Button and ClimatePartner certified</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-action-behind.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-action-behind.webp\" alt=\"A rider descending technical terrain while wearing the Hiline pack. \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-action-behind.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-action-behind-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-action-behind-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-action-behind-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-action-behind-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-action-behind-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deuter-Hiline-action-behind-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>If you want to carry your gear and protect your back, the Hiline might be the pack for you. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Deuter Hiline: Pricing and Availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Hiline packs are priced at £275.00 for the 8-liter and £285.00 for the 14-liter size.
