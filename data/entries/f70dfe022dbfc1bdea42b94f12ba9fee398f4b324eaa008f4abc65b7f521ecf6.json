One of my first memories of the sport was seeing him smashing up Tenbosse in the Tour of Flanders. I was also a big fan of Jan Ullrich. Those were my two idols. It was a different time in cycling; I’m very happy that it changed a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When did you decide that you wanted to be a professional cyclist? </strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was always one of the better ones in my age group, but my parents said it’s important to have a degree so I started studying and enjoyed being a student. I had severe Epstein-Barr virus during my last year as a junior, so actually I just did cycling as a hobby, not with the idea of becoming a pro. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But suddenly, in my third year as an under-23, I got seventh at Roubaix without really living for it. I felt this was the moment to really go for it. The year after, I became Belgian [under-23 road race] champion. I thought maybe I’m going to be sad if I don’t try at least for one year. I was lucky it worked out.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You’re a familiar sight driving the front of the peloton, earning you the nickname ‘the Tractor’. How did you end up in that position?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I noticed I was always getting better when the races were very long and hard. My last year with Topsport [2016] I was there in the final of races a lot, but then at the finish I was always sixth or seventh out of seven. I thought the role of domestique would suit me, but it was hard to get the opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was very happy Patrick Lefevere saw my potential and gave me a shot at QuickStep. I knew I was never going to be the big leader, but I thought I had it in me to do a similar job to [Belgian domestique] Julian Vermote, and it turned out I was capable of that. I’m still very grateful to this day for the chance I got there to prove myself.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"727\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/tim-de-clerq-2-727x970.webp\" alt=\"Tim Declerq\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/tim-de-clerq-2-727x970.webp 727w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/tim-de-clerq-2-225x300.webp 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/tim-de-clerq-2-768x1025.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/tim-de-clerq-2-1151x1536.webp 1151w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/tim-de-clerq-2-750x1000.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/tim-de-clerq-2-1140x1521.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/tim-de-clerq-2.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Sean Hardy</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>I think there’s nothing wrong with taking responsibility. It also gives that little bit extra to the team leaders, because you see somebody really give 100% for the team, then they say, ‘Come on, we have to go that extra mile because the other guys put in so much effort I cannot disappoint them.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/matteo-jorgenson-interview\">‘I have a brain that doesn’t really let up’: Matteo Jorgenson Q&amp;A</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/stefan-kung-interview\">‘A major goal of mine for 2025 is to have fun’: Stefan Küng Q&amp;A</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ben-o-connor-interview\">‘It was a dream year’: Ben O’Connor Q&amp;A</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p><strong>What are you thinking about when you’re leading the bunch? </strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not always easy, mentally. Sometimes you think, ‘Here we go again. It’s going to be a long day.’ In the beginning, when you’re trying to control the breakaway it is sometimes good because you have some adrenaline, but then when you really have to start to pull and the bunch are very easy behind you, it feels sometimes <em>à bloc</em> [on the limit] because you don’t have the adrenaline and you know there’s still such a long way to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s hardest early on when nobody’s watching and there are no TV cameras. Not that I ride for the cameras, but that’s the part of the race that’s forgotten by everyone. The other guys are able to save themselves and you are the only ones who have to make a lot of effort while the others are cruising. I’m really not complaining – I love my job and I know it’s also the reason why I’m still in the peloton, but it’s not always easy.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+6\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-6-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'escape to your favourite place every month', click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-6-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-6-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-6-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-6-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-6-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-6-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-6-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Domestiques often say riding in the </strong><strong>grupetto</strong><strong> is harder than it looks. Do you agree?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They think that the <em>grupetto</em> just goes along at 200 watts, but nowadays the level at the front of the race is so high that sometimes the back is not the nicest place to be. It’s also where there are the most irritations between riders. If I have to stay with the sprinters on the climbs, that can be quite stressful, to know how to pace yourself to make it inside the time cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In recent seasons you’ve come close to winning. Is victory a target?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After [Belgian one-day race] Le Samyn in 2019, when I was still out front in the final kilometre, at that moment I thought, ‘I’m going to win. I’m sure I’m going to win.’ And it really got into my legs; I couldn’t push even 400 watts anymore [he eventually finished seventh].</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From that moment I said I’m not going to put too much pressure on myself. I’m happy with the career I made, no matter what. Of course it would be a nice bonus to take that win, but if it doesn’t come I will not think that my career wasn’t successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I have such a specific job, once the real racing starts my day is often already over. For me it’s sometimes just nice to ride a bit of the final, to really be there in the heart of the race. That’s really motivating, even though in the final itself I have to sacrifice myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do you feel about cycling’s evolution in recent years?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s harder now compared to 20-30 years ago, when you could still do some crazy things. I feel for the young guys nowadays. They’re already so professional from such a young age. I’m happy I could enjoy a little bit of childhood. Those two years when I was studying, I could still go to some parties and see how life was. I’m grateful I had the opportunity to be young and enjoy life, and to have time to seek what I really wanted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays a higher percentage of people are already at their best, for example, at 20 years old. I had my best season when I was 31 or 32, so people like me would find it very hard to have a place in the bunch now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What brings you the most joy on the bike?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helping somebody else to take the win. You know that although it’s small, you’ve had an impact on that victory. That’s something I cherish.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclist newsletter banner saying 'stay one step ahead of the pack, click here to sign up'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tim-declerq-interview\">‘I feel for the young guys nowadays’: Tim Declercq Q&amp;A</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"f70dfe022dbfc1bdea42b94f12ba9fee398f4b324eaa008f4abc65b7f521ecf6","category":"Cycling"}
