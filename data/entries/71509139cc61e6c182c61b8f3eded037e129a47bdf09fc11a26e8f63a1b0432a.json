The servers, primarily located in China, no longer display their usual content; instead, many list the siteâ€™s file directory, which shows all files have been given a .locked extension, indicating they have been encrypted. An accompanying ransom note demands roughly $6,500 in exchange for the decryption key.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tellyouthepass-php.ransom-note.webp\"><img alt=\"The output of PHP servers infected by TellYouThePass ransomware.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tellyouthepass-php.ransom-note-640x621.webp\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tellyouthepass-php.ransom-note.webp 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tellyouthepass-php.ransom-note.webp\">The output of PHP servers infected by TellYouThePass ransomware.</a> (credit: Censys)</p></div>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tellyouthepass-ransom-note.webp\"><img alt=\"The accompanying ransom note.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tellyouthepass-ransom-note-640x101.webp\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tellyouthepass-ransom-note.webp 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tellyouthepass-ransom-note.webp\">The accompanying ransom note.</a> (credit: Censys)</p></div>\n<h2>When opportunity knocks</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/06/php-vulnerability-allows-attackers-to-run-malicious-code-on-windows-servers/\">vulnerability</a>, tracked as CVE-2024-4577 and carrying a severity rating of 9.8 out of 10, stems from errors in the way PHP converts Unicode characters into ASCII. A feature built into Windows known as Best Fit allows attackers to use a technique known as argument injection to convert user-supplied input into characters that pass malicious commands to the main PHP application. Exploits allow attackers to bypass CVE-2012-1823, a critical code execution vulnerability patched in PHP in 2012.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031861#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031861&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"71509139cc61e6c182c61b8f3eded037e129a47bdf09fc11a26e8f63a1b0432a","category":"Tech"}
