The Italian brand’s steel race bike is the answer to that problem.</p>\n<p>Cinelli says the frame has been designed for riders who want the feel of a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-frame-materials/\">steel frame</a> but the position of a carbon race bike.</p>\n<h2>Steel is real</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cinelli Nemo Tig Road on a farm track\" title=\"RussellBurton_20231025_2DX1018\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Steel is one of a number of compelling alternatives to carbon fibre.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>The Nemo Tig Road is manufactured at Cinelli’s factory in Milan, Italy, and is constructed from triple-butted Columbus Spirit tubing. That means each tube has three different wall thicknesses to improve the ride quality and drop weight.</p>\n<p>Columbus is Cinelli’s next door neighbour and Cinelli says the tubing is manufactured less than 50 metres from its frame-building workshop.</p>\n<p>Cinelli has had a long association with Columbus, with former Columbus owner Antonio Colombo partnering with the brand back in 1978.</p>\n<p>Cinelli says the Nemo Tig Road’s frame weighs 1,850g in a size 56cm. The Columbus Futura carbon fork it’s paired with is said to weigh 440g.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"28m\" title=\"RussellBurton_20231025_2DX1032\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 28mm rubber just about fits.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>The Nemo Tig Disc flies in the face of many of the latest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes/\">road bikes</a> with ever-increasing tyre clearances – there’s room for 28mm rubber on this machine and that’s it.
