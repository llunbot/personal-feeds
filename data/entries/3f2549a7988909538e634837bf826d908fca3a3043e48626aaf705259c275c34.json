The virus particles are injected into the caterpillar through the wasp’s stinger, along with the wasp’s own eggs. The viruses then dump their contents into the caterpillar’s cells, delivering <a href=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2020/what-do-genes-do-things-know\">genes</a> that are unlike those in a normal virus. Those genes suppress the caterpillar’s immune system and control its development, turning it into a harmless nursery for the wasp’s young.</p>\n<p>The insect world is full of species of parasitic wasps that spend their infancy eating other insects alive. And for reasons that scientists don’t fully understand, they have repeatedly adopted and tamed wild, disease-causing viruses and turned them into biological weapons. Half a dozen examples already are described, and new research hints at many more.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023393#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023393&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Knowable Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3f2549a7988909538e634837bf826d908fca3a3043e48626aaf705259c275c34","category":"Tech"}
