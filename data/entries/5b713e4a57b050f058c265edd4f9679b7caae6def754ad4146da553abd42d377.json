As always, there aren’t any actual savings during the promotion, but you can score a gift card for a future purchase when you buy certain devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are a lot that are excluded this year. After Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2141045/apple-black-friday-shopping-event-november-2023-gift-card-offers.html\">surprisingly included</a> the Apple Watch Series 9 in its offer last year, the Series 10 isn’t part of this year’s event, nor is the Apple Watch Ultra or any of the new Macs. Here’s a list of the devices that are excluded from the promotion:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 16 (all models)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini</li>\n\n\n\n<li>14-inch MacBook Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>16-inch MacBook Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac mini</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iMac</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac Studio</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Studio Display</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch Series 10</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch Ultra</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Vision Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>HomePod mini</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Magic Mouse/Trackpad/Keyboard</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Pencil (USB-C)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a long list and includes many of the products people would want to buy. Some of the offers seem low as well, most notably $25 back for buying an iPhone SE, which is more than two years old. Back in 2022, Apple offered a $50 gift card for the same iPhone SE it sells now. It’s also surprising to see the AirPods 4 on the list, which arrived in September alongside the new iPhones and Watches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that if you’re looking for a new MacBook Pro or iPad mini, there are <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1375970/apple-black-friday-deals-2024.html\">plenty of retailers that are offering actual discounts</a>, some at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2526826/the-15-inch-macbook-air-just-got-a-crazy-black-friday-price-cut.html\">prices lower than we’ve ever seen before</a>. So stay tuned to Macworld throughout the next week as we track and highlight the best deals on everything Apple sells.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5b713e4a57b050f058c265edd4f9679b7caae6def754ad4146da553abd42d377","category":"Apple"}
