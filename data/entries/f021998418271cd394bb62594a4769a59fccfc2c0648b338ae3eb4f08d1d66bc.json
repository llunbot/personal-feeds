You can get it on Windows machines too, where it can be used instead of iTunes. iMazing offers far more versatility than Apple's built-in ‌iPhone‌ management options, and it will be ready to go for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/\">macOS Sonoma</a> when the updates launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/2023.06-MacRumors-AppleWatch-screen-1.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nWith iMazing, you can create hassle-free wireless backups of your ‌iPhone‌, with multiple versions available. With <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> backup, new backups overwrite your old backups, so you can get in a sticky situation if you need access to something that was overwritten. You won't lose older files that you might be looking for with iMazing, and there are even options to schedule your backups regularly. Backups can be saved to any local storage device, including a NAS, keeping your data out of the cloud.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor transferring photos from an iOS device to a Mac or vice versa, there is a drag and drop option for moving images around. You can keep the images that you want and get rid of the clutter, with iMazing offering support for HEIF, RAW, PNG, and JPG files. A built-in EXIF viewer shows data on file type, size, and location, plus there are tools for creating and editing albums for easy organization.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/2023.06-MacRumors-AppleWatch-screen-3.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nBackups of iMessages and WhatsApp can be created with iMazing, and not only can you save all of the text, it also keeps a copy of photos, videos, contacts, and links. iMazing is also useful for music management because you can transfer songs from an iOS device to a computer or from a computer to an iOS device. It's particularly useful if you have an old ‌iPhone‌ or iPod and no other way to get the music off of it, or if you simply want a way to manage physical media without relying on cloud music services. All media types are supported, and iMazing has an included media player so you don't even need to swap apps to hear your songs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/2023.06-MacRumors-AppleWatch-screen-2.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\niMazing makes upgrading to a new device easy with device-to-device transfers. You can pick and choose what you want to move from your old device to your new device, and there is a drag-and-drop Quick Transfer feature if you just want to move a few files.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/2023.06-MacRumors-AppleWatch-screen-4.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nFor apps, iMazing keeps backups and can be used to restore app data of deleted apps, plus you can do quick mass cleanups with just a few clicks if your ‌iPhone‌ tends to get cluttered with apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you want to get a copy of iMazing, you can do so <a href=\"https://imazing.com/app?utm_source=macrumors&amp;utm_medium=sponsorship&amp;utm_campaign=wwdc23giveway\">from the iMazing website</a>. iMazing is priced at $39.99 for a single device, with multi-device licenses also available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe have an ‌Apple Watch Ultra‌ and a free copy of iMazing for one lucky <em>MacRumors</em> reader.
