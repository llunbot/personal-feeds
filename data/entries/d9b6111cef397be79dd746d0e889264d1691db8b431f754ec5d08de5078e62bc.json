Last week,\nthe cable news pioneer suffered its lowest-rated week since June\n2015, averaging just 429,000 total daily viewers from\nMonday-Friday. CNN was also down double digits compared to the\nsame week last year in both total viewership and in the key\nadvertising demographic of viewers ages 25-54. MSNBC more than\ndoubled CNN’s daily audience, drawing 976,000 total viewers, while\nFox News averaged 1.4 million.

And on Friday night, the channel’s <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/cnn-moving-chris-wallaces-sunday-interview-show-to-friday-nights\">much-hyped\ninterview show</a> hosted by Chris Wallace averaged only\n224,000 total viewers at 10 p.m., drawing 60,000 fewer viewers\nthan Newsmax’s offering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Losing to Newsmax.
