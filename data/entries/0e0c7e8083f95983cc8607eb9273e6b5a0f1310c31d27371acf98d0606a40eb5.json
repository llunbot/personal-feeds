Wang and Joshua P. Song are listed as the inventors. The patent’s abstract describes a “rear housing wall [that] may have a glass portion or other transparent structure through which projectors project images onto nearby surfaces” and that there could also be sensors that receive light, feasibly for wireless connections.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/imac-projector-back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iMac projector patent\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/imac-projector-back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2100w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/imac-projector-back.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/imac-projector-back.jpg?resize=768%2C433&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/imac-projector-back.jpg?resize=1200%2C677&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/imac-projector-back.jpg?resize=1536%2C867&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/imac-projector-back.jpg?resize=2048%2C1156&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/imac-projector-back.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/imac-projector-back.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"677\" /><figcaption>The patent depicts an iMac-like computer with portions that can be used for a projector.</figcaption></figure><p>USPTO/Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The patent also states that the iMac would include “gaze detection sensors, three-dimensional image sensors, cameras, and other components,” which sounds like the sensors necessary for Face ID. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another component described in the patent filing is the stand, which would have a “glass planner portion” and it would house “a pixel array, a wireless communications circuit, and a wireless power circuit.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the patent doesn’t explicitly state that the described features are for an iMac, the diagrams and descriptions seem to fit, and the patent refers to a “computer” in its summary. Feasibly, an Apple display can be outfitted with the described features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say that Apple does release an iMac that can project an image. What for? It can be used for online meetings and FaceTime calls. The iMac is often used as a TV in small rooms, so it can be used in an entertainment center in a larger room. Apple could also promote it as a gaming feature, though gamers would argue that GPU performance and the available library are the issues, not the display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple files patents frequently and many of the products and features Apple files never get released to the general public–anyone remember Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678375/apple-patents-self-lacing-back-to-the-future-shoes.html\">patent for self-lacing shoes</a>? The iMac projector patent does seem more feasible than the shoes, and if it does happen, it may be a couple of years.</p>\n\niMac</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0e0c7e8083f95983cc8607eb9273e6b5a0f1310c31d27371acf98d0606a40eb5","category":"Apple"}
