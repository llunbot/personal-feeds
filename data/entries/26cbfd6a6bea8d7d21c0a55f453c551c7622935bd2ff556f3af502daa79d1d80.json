While iOS 17.1 introduced some of the “coming later this year” features of iOS 17, there are still a few to come, and we expect iOS 17.2 to include quite a few of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest one is the Journal app, which Apple announced at WWDC in June. You’re also getting Spatial Video recording (to get you ready for the Apple Vision Pro), body shapes for Memoji, a favorites playlist in Apple Music, Weather improvements, AirDrop improvements, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Update 12/11/23</strong>: iOS 17.2 is out now for everyone. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s new in iOS 17.2 – Release Notes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the release notes for iOS 17.2.
