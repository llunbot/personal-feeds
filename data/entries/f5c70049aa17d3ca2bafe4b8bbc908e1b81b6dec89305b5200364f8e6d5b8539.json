Simply lay out your outfit, fold along the lines, roll it up, and tuck it into its own pocket. Boom, your clothes are rolled up and ready to roll.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fold-n-roll-clothes-packing-sheet-3.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fold-n-roll-clothes-packing-sheet-3.jpg\" alt=\"fold n roll clothes packing roll laid open\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fold-n-roll-clothes-packing-sheet-3.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fold-n-roll-clothes-packing-sheet-3-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fold-n-roll-clothes-packing-sheet-3-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fold-n-roll-clothes-packing-sheet-3-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fold-n-roll-clothes-packing-sheet-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fold-n-roll-clothes-packing-sheet-3-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The FOLD+RºLL is the brainchild of longtime commuter and sustainable transport consultant Beate (pronounced bay-otta) Kubitz.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When I used to cycle to work, I struggled with keeping tabs on my clothes,” Beate says. “There was more than one incident of reaching into my bag for my laptop and flinging my knickers across the office.
