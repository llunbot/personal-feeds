{"title":"We just got our first look at the iPhone 16 and Apple finally got the colors right","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2414097/iphone-16-leak-design-colors-white-black-blue-green-pink.html","date":1722431976000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s now a little over a month to go until Apple reveals its new smartphones for fall 2024. With time running short, many details of the iPhone 16 launch may have already leaked into the public realm–such as the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2301253/2024-iphone-colors-iphone-16-plus-pro-max-purple-yellow-gold-space-gray.html\">new colors</a> that buyers of the new handsets will be able to choose from. It just depends on which sources you choose to believe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in May, we covered a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2339731/a-classic-iphone-color-is-looking-more-likely-than-ever-to-return-this-year.html\">report on this subject</a> from the respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Yellow was set to be dropped from the list this year, Kuo predicted, while white would come in. And now an apparent leak of dummy models appears to corroborate this claim.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://t.co/0vlSFnwzR4\">pic.twitter.com/0vlSFnwzR4</a></p>— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SonnyDickson/status/1818474212090429828?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 31, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On X (formerly Twitter), the also-reliable leaker Sonny Dickson has posted a photo of five iPhones. From left to right, they are white, black, blue, green, and pink. Exactly the line-up we were expecting based on Kuo’s report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s one thing to name a color, of course, and another entirely to picture it. The white, black, and pink finishes are all largely what we’d expect, but the green in particular is a fascinating choice: a rich and lovely oceanic turquoise. The blue meanwhile is surprisingly bright and vivid compared with the dark blue-grey of the iPhone 13, the desaturated mist blue of the iPhone 14, and the ultra-pale, pretty-much-white blue of the iPhone 15. Neither finish matches anything we’ve seen from the iPhone range in recent years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has proved loyal to blue over the years, with variants of this color remaining part of the offering even as yellow, green, and even white come and go. But Apple has yet to settle on what shade of blue it likes best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bear in mind that, even this close to the launch, the final details of the new iPhones may not be completely settled–and these are dummy models that may merely show potential colors rather than the locked-in finishes we’ll see in September. The evidence is mounting, however, that the late 2024 iPhone line-up will look roughly like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all the latest news and rumors relating to this fall’s launches, check out our regularly updated <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16 superguide</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4112417626c2baa85f1a3228d15e79022fb4e95991978bd1c57fbd6edaa9eef7","category":"Apple"}
