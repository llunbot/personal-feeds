But now it adds an even more boxy angular +/-10° stem to offer a bit lower position on the bike. The new stem has a more aggressive machined aesthetic, and what looks like slightly lower stack.

The existing PRO Quality Guide describes that for a PRO component to be released to riders it needs to test at 110% load for alloy and 125% load for carbon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For stage 1, PRO alloy components are tested to 308 Newton, and PRO carbon components are tested to 350 Newton. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For stage 2, PRO components need to pass at the higher MTB force of 495 Newton for alloy, and 562.5 Newtons for carbon. Note the results of stage 1 and 2 for dummy handlebar testing highlighted in green above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new PRO Discover Aero Carbon Handlebar is the first PRO Discover product to be tested according to the standard listed above. Its passing should further reassure riders of the robust quality of this new PRO handlebar.</p>\n<cite>PRO</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>PRO Discover Aero Carbon handlebar &amp; Stem 10 – Pricing &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/PRO-Discover-Aero-Carbon-gravel-bike-handlebar-and-10-degree-stem_Laurens-ten-Dam.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/PRO-Discover-Aero-Carbon-gravel-bike-handlebar-and-10-degree-stem_Laurens-ten-Dam.jpg\" alt=\"PRO Discover Aero Carbon gravel bike handlebar &amp; 10 degree stem, Laurens ten Dam\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/PRO-Discover-Aero-Carbon-gravel-bike-handlebar-and-10-degree-stem_Laurens-ten-Dam.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/PRO-Discover-Aero-Carbon-gravel-bike-handlebar-and-10-degree-stem_Laurens-ten-Dam-225x300.jpg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/PRO-Discover-Aero-Carbon-gravel-bike-handlebar-and-10-degree-stem_Laurens-ten-Dam-90x120.jpg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/PRO-Discover-Aero-Carbon-gravel-bike-handlebar-and-10-degree-stem_Laurens-ten-Dam-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/PRO-Discover-Aero-Carbon-gravel-bike-handlebar-and-10-degree-stem_Laurens-ten-Dam-1152x1536.jpg 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-new PRO Discover Aero Carbon gravel race bike handlebar sells for 350€ in three widths – 40, 42 &amp; 44cm.
