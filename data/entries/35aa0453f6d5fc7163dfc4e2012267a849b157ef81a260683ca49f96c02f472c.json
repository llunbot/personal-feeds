While the device is expected to have an impressively thin and light design, rumors indicate it will have some compromises compared to iPhone 17 Pro models, including only a single rear camera, a single speaker, and an A19 chip instead of a more powerful A19 Pro chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile there have been some concerns that the iPhone 17 Air's thin design could result in limited battery life, the device might end up beating expectations. There are three rumored features for the iPhone 17 Air that could contribute to longer battery life than one might imagine, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/iphone-17-air-high-density-battery-rumor/\">a higher-density battery</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/iphone-16e-battery-life/\">Apple's power-efficient C1 modem</a>, and the lack of an Ultra Wide camera providing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/iphone-16e-teardown/\">more internal space for a larger battery</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBelow, we recap 12 key rumors for the \"iPhone 17 Air\" as of March 2025:<ul><li>The thinnest iPhone ever, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/\">measuring just 5.5mm at its thinnest point</a>, but possibly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/iphone-17-air-9-5mm-thick-including-camera/\">up to 9.5mm with the rear camera bump included</a></li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/\">6.6-inch OLED display</a> with Face ID <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/\">and a Dynamic Island</a></li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/ltpo-for-all-iphone-17-models-report/\">ProMotion support</a> for up to a 120Hz refresh rate</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/\">A19 chip</a> instead of A19 Pro chip</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/\">8GB of RAM</a> for Apple Intelligence support</li>\r<br />\n<li>A <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/\">single 48-megapixel rear camera</a> on an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/17/iphone-17-air-front-page-tech-renders/\">all-new elongated camera bar</a></li>\r<br />\n<li>A <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/\">24-megapixel front camera</a></li>\r<br />\n<li>A <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/iphone-17-air-features-reported/\">single speaker</a> in the earpiece, no bottom speaker</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/iphone-17-air-wifi-7-rumor/\">Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip</a></li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/apples-c1-modem-iphone-17-air-lack-mmwave/\">Apple-designed C1 modem for cellular connectivity</a></li>\r<br />\n<li>eSIM only, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/\">no physical SIM card slot</a> worldwide</li>\r<br />\n<li>An <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/iphone-17-air-and-iphone-xr-in-common/\">off-center USB-C port</a></li></ul>Bookmark our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/\">iPhone 17 Air roundup</a> to stay up to date with more rumors in the coming months.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/15/ultra-thin-iphone-17-rumors/\">Ultra-Thin 'iPhone 17 Air' Rumored to Include These 12 Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ultra-thin-iphone-17-air-rumored-to-include-these-12-features.2453192/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"35aa0453f6d5fc7163dfc4e2012267a849b157ef81a260683ca49f96c02f472c","category":"Apple"}
