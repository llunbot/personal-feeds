Industry trade groups that represent Internet service providers will likely argue, as they have unsuccessfully argued before, that the FCC does not have authority to classify broadband as a telecommunications service.</p>\n<p>Federal appeals courts upheld previous FCC decisions on whether to apply common carrier rules to broadband, a fact that current agency officials point to in their plan to revive Obama-era regulation of ISPs under Title II. But some legal commentators claim the FCC is doomed to fail this time because of the Supreme Court's evolving approach on whether federal agencies can decide \"major questions\" without explicit instructions from Congress.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974327#p3\">Read 81 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974327&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"41fd613e9caeb7af163001962865bc9b75ff9796d3f1f5b1153a4dd946b8a54d","category":"Tech"}
