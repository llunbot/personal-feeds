Be it road, gravel, mountain, or inner-city mixed terrain routes, there is a myriad of hidden paths, bike expressways, and cutty cut-throughs connecting this city’s many parks. That route finding was the impetus for <a href=\"https://www.letsridecyclery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Let’s Ride Cyclery</a>‘s Mike Kalenda to start his <a href=\"https://latouristrace.com/trans-san-gabriel\" target=\"_blank\">LA Tourist Race</a>.

He’s a superb mechanic, a strong rider, and is full of charisma. Over the years, I’ve shot a number of his bikes – which you can peep below in our Related archives – and have been lucky enough to have him service my own bikes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/03/SalsaWarroadLA-48.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/03/SalsaWarroadLA-48.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/03/SalsaWarroadLA-48.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/03/SalsaWarroadLA-48.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/03/SalsaWarroadLA-48.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/03/SalsaWarroadLA-48.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/03/SalsaWarroadLA-48.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w\" /></p>\n<p>Let’s Ride Cyclery is in Burbank, California, right next to Los Angeles, and has lots of easy access to Griffith Park and the Verdugo Mountains, my bastion during my five-year residence in the city. While it’s not as hip as Highland Park or Silverlake, Burbank has its own vibe and with its proximity to parks and gravel, is often overlooked by prospective residents of Los Angeles. It is also home to the chillest airport in all of California… IYKYK.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1336\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2016/06/SwiftCampout-62.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2016/06/SwiftCampout-62.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2016/06/SwiftCampout-62.jpg?resize=1200,802&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2016/06/SwiftCampout-62.jpg?resize=1900,1269&amp;quality=75 1900w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2016/06/SwiftCampout-62.jpg?resize=1335,892&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2016/06/SwiftCampout-62.jpg?resize=700,468&amp;quality=75 700w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1336\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2016/06/SwiftCampout-63.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2016/06/SwiftCampout-63.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2016/06/SwiftCampout-63.jpg?resize=1200,802&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2016/06/SwiftCampout-63.jpg?resize=1900,1269&amp;quality=75 1900w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2016/06/SwiftCampout-63.jpg?resize=1335,892&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2016/06/SwiftCampout-63.jpg?resize=700,468&amp;quality=75 700w\" /></p>\n<p>Mike learned a lot over the years, having worked at a number of shops in Southern California. His takeaways were, in short, service is king, building community takes effort, and support the small guys as much as possible. The bike companies he stocks at Let’s Ride range from Moots, Pegoretti, REEB, and then a handful of QBP brands to round out the spectrum of affordability.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/Lets-Ride-Cyclery-Burbank-CA-34.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/Lets-Ride-Cyclery-Burbank-CA-34.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/Lets-Ride-Cyclery-Burbank-CA-34.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/Lets-Ride-Cyclery-Burbank-CA-34.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/Lets-Ride-Cyclery-Burbank-CA-34.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/Lets-Ride-Cyclery-Burbank-CA-34.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/Lets-Ride-Cyclery-Burbank-CA-34.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/Lets-Ride-Cyclery-Burbank-CA-34.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>On any given afternoon, Mike, or Steph (sorry to have missed you, girl!) will have a stunning Pegoretti in for a service, or a Moots YBB waiting in the stand for an overhaul, and even e-commuter bikes in for a kickstand install.
