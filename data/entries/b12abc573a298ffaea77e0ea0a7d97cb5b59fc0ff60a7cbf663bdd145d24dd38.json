The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/science/colorado-brain-data-privacy.html\">reported</a> that neural data is increasingly being collected and sold nationwide. And after a <a href=\"https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/546252348/global-neurotech-industry-investment-digest-2021\">market analysis</a> showed that investments in neurotechnology leapt by 60 percent globally from 2019 to 2020—and were valued at $30 billion in 2021—Big Tech companies have significantly intensified plans to develop their own products to rake in potentially billions.</p>\n<p>For instance, in 2023, <a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/input/tech/mark-zuckerberg-ar-glasses-neural-interface-luxottica\">Meta demoed a wristband</a> with a neural interface used to control its smart glasses and unveiled an <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-agi/meta-just-achieved-mind-reading-with-ai-a-breakthrough-in-brain-computer-interface-technology-98cf7deb6858\">AI system that could be used to decode the mind</a>. In January, Elon Musk announced that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/01/elon-musks-neuralink-puts-brain-chip-in-first-human-amid-federal-scrutiny/\">Neuralink implanted its first brain chip in a human</a> that can be used to control a device with their thoughts. And just last month, <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/03/21/future-apple-vision-pro-brainwave-sensors-could-improve-mental-and-physical-health\">Apple Insider reported</a> that \"Apple is working on technology that could turn the Apple Vision Pro into a brainwave reader to improve mental health, assist with training and workouts, and help with mindfulness.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018276#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018276&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b12abc573a298ffaea77e0ea0a7d97cb5b59fc0ff60a7cbf663bdd145d24dd38","category":"Tech"}
