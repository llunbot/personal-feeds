With an X-ray tube positioned above the tumor in her left breast, Lee was treated with a torrent of high-energy particles that penetrated into the malignant mass.</p>\n<p>“And so,” as her treating clinician later <a href=\"https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/abs/10.1148/21.2.156\">wrote</a>, “without the blaring of trumpets or the beating of drums, X-ray therapy was born.”</p>\n<p>Radiation therapy has come a long way since those <a href=\"https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/69/2/383/550073/Advances-in-Radiotherapy-and-Implications-for-the\">early beginnings</a>. The discovery of radium and other radioactive metals opened the doors to administering higher doses of radiation to target cancers located deeper within <a href=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/content/reports/special-report-building-bodies\">the body</a>. The introduction of proton therapy later made it possible to precisely guide radiation beams to tumors, thus reducing damage to surrounding healthy tissues—a degree of accuracy that was further refined through improvements in medical physics, computer technologies and state-of-the-art imaging techniques.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032646#p3\">Read 43 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032646&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Knowable Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b9bf9413a5e1c635fae551da6168679200a1aa7c5d85f23563c4ee8b330ee239","category":"Tech"}
