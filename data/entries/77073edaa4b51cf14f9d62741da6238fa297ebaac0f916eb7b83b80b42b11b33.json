The new firmware is version 7E108, up from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/02/airpods-max-7e101-firmware/\">prior 7E101 firmware</a> the device was previously running.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Airpods-Max-Feature-Green-Triad.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThere is no word on what's new in the firmware as of yet, if anything. It is likely that the update focuses on under-the-hood performance improvements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the prior 7E101 firmware, Apple added support for lossless audio and ultra low-latency audio for the USB-C ‌AirPods Max‌, so there could also be a bug fix related to this capability.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe USB-C ‌AirPods Max‌ now support 24-bit 48 kHz lossless audio, which is designed to allow listeners to experience music the way the artist created it in the studio.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFirmware <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/airpods-firmware-update-instructions/\">can be installed</a> by putting the ‌AirPods Max‌ in Bluetooth range of an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, or Mac that's connected to Wi-Fi, and then plugging them in to charge. It can take up to 30 minutes for firmware to update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can check your firmware version by going to Settings &gt; Bluetooth and selecting the Info button next to the ‌AirPods Max‌ when they are connected to an ‌iPhone‌, ‌iPad‌, or Mac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>Update</b>: Apple's <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/106340\">release notes</a> state only that the update delivers \"bug fixes and performance improvements\" without providing any detail on what has changed.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max\">AirPods Max (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/apple-releases-airpods-max-firmware-7e108/\">Apple Releases New AirPods Max Firmware</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-airpods-max-firmware.2457415/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"77073edaa4b51cf14f9d62741da6238fa297ebaac0f916eb7b83b80b42b11b33","category":"Apple"}
