The latest leak comes from analyst Jeff Pu, who claims Apple is looking to add next-gen components to what is already shaping up to be a monster update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pu (<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/\">via MacRumors</a>) says Apple will be bringing Wi-Fi 7 to the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max next year. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1073091/iphone-14-review.html\">iPhone 14</a> launched with Wi-Fi 6 and not Wi-Fi 6E, but since then Apple has brought 6E support to the iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini, and is expected to bring it to the iPhone 15 lineup next month. Wi-Fi 7 is expected to deliver real-world speeds of 5.8Gbps, about 60 percent faster than Wi-Fi 6E. Of course, you’ll need a Wi-Fi 7 router to enjoy those speeds, which are quite pricey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Far more interesting is Pu’s prediction that the iPhone 16 Pro models will get a new 48MP ultra-wide camera. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1070324/iphone-14-pro-review.html\">iPhone 14 Pro</a> got a 48MP wide-angle camera, which uses pixel-binning to deliver photos with tremendous clarity. A 48MP ultra-wide camera would presumably bring similar results to the ultra-wide camera and possibly a larger aperture as well for better clarity in challenging light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16</a> is the next iPhone to arrive in September 2024, and will be followed in 2025 by the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">iPhone SE 4</a>.
