{"title":"343 shows first Halo Infinite campaign footage in over a year","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1807151","date":1635175183000,"content":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<div><div></div></div>\n<p>The first and last time we saw footage of <em>Halo Infinite</em>'s campaign mode way back in July of 2020, we were <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/we-should-talk-about-halo-infinites-not-quite-next-gen-premiere/\">a bit underwhelmed by what we saw</a>. Now, with the game's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/08/xbox-series-x-will-launch-in-november-but-without-halo-infinite/\">delayed launch</a> just a few weeks away, Microsoft and 343 Industries have released a six-minute video showcasing more details of the anticipated sequel's story and gameplay.</p>\n<p>A voiceover confirms that the traditional <em>Halo</em> story following the partnership between Master Chief and Cortana is \"now a distant memory\" in <em>Infinite</em>. Instead, John-117 is now hoping to retrieve and work with a new and extremely uninformed AI codenamed The Weapon. Together, the two will explore Zeta Halo to find an answer to the core questions driving <em>Infinite</em>'s story: \"What happened to Cortana?\" and \"What did she do that was so wrong?\"</p>\n<p>The new trailer highlights what the studio says is a campaign structure that offers \"more freedom than ever before.\" There's a brief glimpse at a section of the game's open world \"Tacmap,\" complete with the kind of color-coded mission markers you'd expect from a different sort of game. Completing some of those missions will grant Master Chief control of Forward Operating Bases, which seem key to advancing the story and offering new perks. Through it all, Master Chief will be pursued by \"a sadistic Spartan killer named Jega 'Rdomnai,\" who seems to come from the Covenant's red-tinted Banished faction.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1807151#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1807151&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"52738a6d5eccadf8b6d339ae5c4fe8faeb11be552563b8ed12acdc42ab70af15","category":"Tech"}
