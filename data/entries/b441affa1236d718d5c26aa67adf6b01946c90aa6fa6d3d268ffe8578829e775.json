On January 6, Ingenuity flew 40 feet (12 meters) skyward but then made an unplanned early landing after just 35 seconds. Twelve days later, operators intended to troubleshoot the vehicle with a quick up-and-down test. Data from the vehicle indicated that it ascended to 40 feet again during this test, but then communications were ominously lost at the end of the flight.</p>\n<p>On January 20, NASA reestablished communications with the helicopter, but the space agency declared an end to its flying days after <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/system/resources/detail_files/27902_PIA26243-web.jpg\">an image of the vehicle's shadow</a> showed that at least one of its blades had sustained minor damage. This capped an end to a remarkable mission during which <em>Ingenuity</em> <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/02/before-ingenuity-ever-landed-on-mars-scientists-almost-managed-to-kill-it/\">exceeded all expectations</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005834#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005834&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b441affa1236d718d5c26aa67adf6b01946c90aa6fa6d3d268ffe8578829e775","category":"Tech"}
