The ability to cover ground quickly means you can go out and explore places you wouldn’t otherwise consider.</p>\n<p>These bikes also let you ride in ways you usually couldn’t, and as designs become more refined, their handling increasingly rivals – and in some cases exceeds – that of conventional mountain bikes.</p>\n<p>For more on what to look for when buying an e-MTB, read our buyer’s guide at the bottom of this article.

Descending is more of a mixed bag though, and required quite a bit of fettling for handling confidence.</p>\n<p>The spec’s good value for the bike’s price, although we didn’t find the tyres quite up to the job.

That drops the bike’s weight and ups agility over more heavily built machines.</p>\n<p>You’ll find e-MTBs with either 29in or 27.5in wheels, but ‘<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-faster-mullet-bike-29er/\">mullet builds</a>’ with a 29in wheel up front and a 27.5in rear are becoming increasingly more common. This setup gives good stability at the front and better agility from the smaller rear wheel. Examples include the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/canyon-spectralon-8-0-first-ride-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon Spectral:ON</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/vitus-e-escarpe-vrx-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Vitus E-Escarpe</a>.</p>\n<p>Most e-MTBs are full-suspension bikes, but you can also find trail-oriented electric hardtails, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/canyon-grand-canyon-on/\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon Grand Canyon:ON</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/kinesis-rise-hardtail-e-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Kinesis Rise</a>.</p>\n<h3>Electric mountain bike motors</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bosch, Shimano and Yamaha motors are popular for electric mountain bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mathieu Echeverri / Lapierre</i></span></div>\n<p>Popular choices for e-MTB motors are Bosch, Shimano Steps and Yamaha, while Fazua’s lightweight motor is increasingly making an appearance on weight-focused bikes.</p>\n<p>Bosch Performance Line CX motors provide 600Wh peak power and 75Nm of torque for fuss-free climbing. There’s a natural ride feel and good battery management that gets impressive range out of the system’s battery.</p>\n<p>Shimano’s Steps E-8000 and E-7000 system is still a popular choice, although it has started to show its age, with lower power output and torque than newer rivals. Its smaller batteries give you less range too, but it still boasts low weight and a compact design along with the ability to tune its output.</p>\n<p>However, Shimano has recently launched the new EP8 motor. This boosts torque to 85Nm while reducing weight by around 200g, lowering pedalling drag, increasing range and lowering Q-Factor. The EP8’s launch coincided with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-du-ep800-motor/\">Shimano increasing battery capacity</a> to 630Wh. More and more, you’ll find it being specced on newer electric mountain bikes.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Giant uses the Yamaha Syncdrive Pro motor on its e-MTBs. Its Smart Assist mode uses an array of six sensors, including a gradient sensor, to work out how much power to deliver in any given situation.</p>\n<p>A popular choice on road-going ebikes, the Fazua motor system is to be found on some recent e-MTBs, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/lapierre-ezesty-am-ltd-ultimate-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Lapierre eZesty</a>. It’s lighter, less powerful and has a smaller battery. That means you typically need to put in more of your own pedalling effort, but it drops the bike’s weight down closer to self-propelled models. Plus, you can remove the battery completely and ride the bike without it.</p>\n<p>Specialized has its own motor units, which it specs on the majority of its electric bikes. Its Turbo Levo SL trail bike uses the low torque SL 1.1 motor and a 320Wh battery for less assistance and lighter weight.</p>\n<h3>Electric mountain bike battery capacity</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some bikes allow range to be extended with an additional battery.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>To get you up hills, produce enough power and provide adequate range, most electric mountain bikes will have batteries capacities of around 500Wh to 700Wh.</p>\n<p>An internal battery in the down tube makes for clean lines, but there are also e-MTBs with external batteries. These typically lower the weight and, in models like the Lapierre Overvolt, mean that the battery can be placed lower and more centrally.</p>\n<p>But, as mentioned above, e-MTBs with smaller capacity batteries down to 250Wh are appearing. These trade a more limited range for lighter weight and the potential for improved handling.</p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"e766982d2ba4287ee03bf8260d02a55dde4af1864b3969d9361af35a55849be0","category":"Cycling"}
