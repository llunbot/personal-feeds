[credit:\n                              Apple                            ]\n                      </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n<p>Apple has <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/y895apmf\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> a new version of its popular Pencil peripheral for the iPad. Simply dubbed \"Apple Pencil\" yet again, it is the cheapest option to carry the name yet.</p>\n<p>The new Pencil is priced at <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/y895apmf\" target=\"_blank\">$79</a>; that's $20 cheaper than the first-generation Apple Pencil and $50 cheaper than the second generation. Apple says it will work with any iPad model with a USB-C port.</p>\n<p>In fact, the new Pencil has a USB-C port. That means you'll use a USB-to-USB cable to charge it on your iPad, Mac, USB-C iPhone, charging brick, or whatever. The USB-C port is subtly hidden behind a sliding cap. This is a big improvement over the awkward \"plug your Pencil into the iPad's port\" solution of old.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976577#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976577&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"66e656518003551892205372eea0939f28beb580f9d29d1ace600d933c162f10","category":"Tech"}
