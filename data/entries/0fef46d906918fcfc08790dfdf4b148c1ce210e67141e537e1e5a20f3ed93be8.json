Listen Later is a super simple, super useful service that turns articles into podcast episodes. When you sign up, you get a custom email address to send articles to; every article you forward to your Listen Later address is transformed into <em>very</em> human-like narration, and gets delivered to your private podcast feed. You can subscribe to your private Listen Later podcast feed in any podcast app.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the email gateway, <a href=\"https://www.listenlater.net/tips\">there’s a Shortcut</a> for sending articles from Safari (on Mac or iOS), a web extension for Chrome, and a simple web interface for submitting new articles. It’s very simple and the narrated versions sound great.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.listenlater.net/?referrer=df\">Sign up for free and start listening today</a>. New users get $2 in credits to try it out — no commitment. And if you like it, you simply prepay for credits as you go. There’s no subscription — you simply pay for what you use. I wish more services had a pay-as-you-go model like Listen Later’s.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/06/listen-later\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0fef46d906918fcfc08790dfdf4b148c1ce210e67141e537e1e5a20f3ed93be8","category":"Tech"}
