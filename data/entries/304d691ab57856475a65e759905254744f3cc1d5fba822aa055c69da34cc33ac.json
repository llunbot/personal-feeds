{"title":"Apple Could Still Pull the Plug on Its Much-Maligned FineWoven Cases","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/05/apple-may-discontinue-finewoven-cases/","date":1725531917000,"content":"Last September, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-finewoven/\">stopped selling genuine leather accessories</a> in favor of a more environmentally friendly \"FineWoven\" material, but it did not go down well with customers, and dwindling stock leading up to Apple's iPhone 16 event on September 9 has many people wondering if Apple is about to pull the plug on FineWoven for good.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iPhone-15-Pro-FineWoven-feature.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThe company describes FineWoven as \"luxurious and durable microtwill,\" and sells FineWoven iPhone cases at $59, MagSafe Wallets at $59, AirTag holders at $35, and Apple Watch bands at $99. However, many customers consider FineWoven products to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apples-finewoven-iphone-cases-poor-reviews/\">subpar</a> compared to the leather Apple cases they replaced, with various claims that the fabric is prone to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/finewoven-iphone-case-continued-criticism/\">scratches</a>, stains, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/26/finewoven-iphone-cases-brown-like-rotten-banana/\">discoloration</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nBack in April, Apple leaker and prototype collector Kosutami claimed that Apple had decided to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/21/apple-reportedly-stops-finewoven-production/\">halt production</a> of FiveWoven accessories over durability concerns, although the leaker did not discount the possibility of <a href=\"https://x.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1782646277525983293\">one more round</a> of FineWoven products, possibly in a season of new colors. However, FineWoven accessories in new color options were absent from Apple's spring refresh.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNotably, according to <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-01/apple-s-succession-strategy-m4-mac-mini-cheaper-ipad-magic-keyboard-m0jkdrx5\">Bloomberg</a></em>'s Mark Gurman, stock of iPhone cases and Apple Watch bands in the material is now at an all-time low. That generally means that Apple is either getting ready to kill off FineWoven or plans to update the lineup with different colors and support for new iPhone and Apple Watch models.
