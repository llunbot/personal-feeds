They’re now offering two more aftermarket rocker links for the Forbidden Druid V2 and Transition Smuggler, both of which increase suspension travel and ramp up the bikes’ progressivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to their new rocker links, Cascade was also showing a new battery clamp for Bosch Powertube equipped bikes, a replacement lower cage for SRAM T-Type derailleurs, and a yet-to-be-named brake adjuster.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Forbidden Druid V2 link:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-druid-v2-link.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-druid-v2-link.jpg\" alt=\"Cascade Components, Forbidden Druid V2 link\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-druid-v2-link.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-druid-v2-link-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-druid-v2-link-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-druid-v2-link-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-druid-v2-link-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-druid-v2-link-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Please note the link pictured is a prototype and isn’t fully machined to Cascade’s production standards.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new link built for the Forbidden Druid V2 increases the bike’s travel from 130mm to 135mm. It also increases the leverage rate from the Druid V2’s stock from 24% up to 32%. Cascade says this gives the bike great pop without sacrificing bump-eating capability. Furthermore, this link leaves more clearance for coil shocks and will fit larger springs (EXTs for example). Cascade is unaware of any rear shock that won’t work with this link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Druid V2 link weighs 345g and comes in black or silver. MSRP is $335.59 CAD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(<em>Please note, I’m in Canada, and Cascade’s website defaults to showing prices in CAD – I’ve requested USA pricing to ensure there’s no difference beyond the exchange rate</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Transition Smuggler link:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Transition-smuggler-link.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Transition-smuggler-link.jpg\" alt=\"Cascade Components, Transition Smuggler link\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Transition-smuggler-link.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Transition-smuggler-link-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Transition-smuggler-link-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Transition-smuggler-link-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Transition-smuggler-link-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Transition-smuggler-link-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new link for 2023-current Transition Smugglers increases the bike’s rear travel from 130mm to 140mm (matching the Smuggler’s stock fork length). It also increases the leverage rate to 31% so that you can ride this short-travel bike aggressively. With a considerable ramp-up at end stroke riders can maintain a softer tune for good small impact absorption but still enjoy added resistance to harsh bottom-outs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Smuggler link weighs 313g and comes with bearings and retaining rings pre-installed for easy swapping. It sells for $480 CAD. Color options are black, silver, or orange.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bosch Powertube Latch:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Bosch-Powertube-latch.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Bosch-Powertube-latch.jpg\" alt=\"Cascade Components, Bosch Powertube latch\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Bosch-Powertube-latch.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Bosch-Powertube-latch-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Bosch-Powertube-latch-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Bosch-Powertube-latch-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Bosch-Powertube-latch-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Bosch-Powertube-latch-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cascade likes to solve problems, and this latch seeks to resolve the issues Bosch Powertube-equipped ebikes are having. I was told with Bosch’s plastic clamp, the batteries are sometimes coming loose in the bikes. Cascade’s latch is made from sturdy aluminum with stainless steel pins and offers a clamp force adjustment so you can ensure a solid battery fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Powertube Latch sells for $162.88 CAD.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Brake Adjuster:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-brake-adjuster.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-brake-adjuster.jpg\" alt=\"Cascade Components, brake adjuster\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-brake-adjuster.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-brake-adjuster-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-brake-adjuster-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-brake-adjuster-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-brake-adjuster-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-brake-adjuster-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This unnamed ‘brake adjuster’ is one part Cascade is still developing, so you won’t see it online just yet. The adjuster contains an adjustable air chamber, which adds 15psi of pressure to the brake line. This extra pressure helps reduce the size of air bubbles to ensure consistent brake lever feel. The adjuster can also be used as a pad contact adjustment, as it can be dialed in enough to push the brake pads inwards. Cascade will be offering three different models compatible with TRP, Hayes, and SRAM Maven brakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Transmission Derailleur Cage:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Transmission-derailleur-cage.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Transmission-derailleur-cage.jpg\" alt=\"Cascade Components, transmission derailleur cage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Transmission-derailleur-cage.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Transmission-derailleur-cage-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Transmission-derailleur-cage-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Transmission-derailleur-cage-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Transmission-derailleur-cage-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cascade-components-Transmission-derailleur-cage-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Last up is a replacement cage for SRAM’s T-Type derailleurs. There are two benefits to Cascade’s replacement cage – First, it has oversized 14t upper and 18t lower pulleys. Despite the larger pulleys, Cascade was able to slightly reduce the spacing between them so there’s no loss of clearance with this cage vs. the stock model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, it’s stronger than the stock SRAM cages… but not too strong! Knowing the lower cage assembly should be the sacrificial piece in the event of a nasty impact, Cascade made sure their cage will still break or bend before the rest of the derailleur does. On top of that, the front piece protecting the lower pulley wheel (a commonly damaged part) can be replaced separately from the rest of the cage assembly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cascade Transmission Derailleur Cage weighs 112g. Color options are black or silver, and MSRP is $418.43 CAD. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://cascadecomponents.bike/\">cascadecomponents.bike</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cascade-components-brake-adjuster-prototype-sram-transmission-cage-pulleys-replacement/\">Cascade Components Shows Pressurized Brake Adjuster Proto, Transmission Cage + Pulleys, More!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"74f8039cebe43377eb7413dced71c38267c626fb120975a947964bbdfb19b795","category":"Cycling"}
