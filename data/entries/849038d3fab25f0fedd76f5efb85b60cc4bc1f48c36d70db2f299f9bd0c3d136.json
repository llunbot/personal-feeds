{"title":"The Trump Administration Accidentally Included Jeffrey Goldberg, Editor of The Atlantic, in a Signal Group Chat That Revealed War Plans for Yemen","link":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/","date":1742840090000,"content":"\n<p>Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic (<a href=\"https://apple.news/Ay8ft1edESzS5rQlnHX1rFQ\">News+ link</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The world found out shortly before 2 p.m. eastern time on March 15\nthat the United States was bombing Houthi targets across Yemen.</p>\n\n<p>I, however, knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that\nthe attack might be coming. The reason I knew this is that Pete\nHegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at\n11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons\npackages, targets, and timing.</p>\n\n<p>This is going to require some explaining. [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The notion of a journalist being accidentally included in a war-planning group of national security leaders — and the very notion that U.S. national security leaders would use Signal to conduct such a group — is so preposterous that Goldberg had assumed the group was a hoax, with the intention of embarrassing him. But it was real.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Earlier today, I emailed Waltz and sent him a message on his\nSignal account. I also wrote to Pete Hegseth, John Ratcliffe,\nTulsi Gabbard, and other officials. In an email, I outlined some\nof my questions: Is the “Houthi PC small group” a genuine Signal\nthread? Did they know that I was included in this group? Was I (on\nthe off chance) included on purpose? If not, who did they think I\nwas? Did anyone realize who I was when I was added, or when I\nremoved myself from the group? Do senior Trump-administration\nofficials use Signal regularly for sensitive discussions? Do the\nofficials believe that the use of such a channel could endanger\nAmerican personnel?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ll add: Do they sniff glue and eat paste?</p>\n\n<p>There’s so much chaos at the moment resulting from the Trump administration’s actions during these first two months that it’s easy to overlook one salient fact: Trump has  chosen to surround himself with idiots.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/24/trump-admin-included-goldberg-in-yemen-war-plan-signal-group\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"849038d3fab25f0fedd76f5efb85b60cc4bc1f48c36d70db2f299f9bd0c3d136","category":"Tech"}
