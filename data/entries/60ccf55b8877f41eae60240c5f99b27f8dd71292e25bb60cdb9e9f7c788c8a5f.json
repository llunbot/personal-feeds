It's meant to sit on your media console instead of hanging from your TV's USB port like the Chromecast.

Google is replacing 2020's $50 4K Chromecast with Google TV USB dongle with an HDMI set-top box that costs $100.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041337#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041337&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"60ccf55b8877f41eae60240c5f99b27f8dd71292e25bb60cdb9e9f7c788c8a5f","category":"Tech"}
