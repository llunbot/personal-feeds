{"title":"Home Depot Is Slowly Rolling Out Apple Pay Support","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/08/home-depot-apple-pay-support/","date":1728485106000,"content":"\n<p>Chance Miller, writing for 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to multiple 9to5Mac readers and reports across social\nmedia, Home Depot has also recently started rolling out Apple Pay\nsupport. Home Depot has been a major Apple Pay holdout, resisting\npressure from its customers to add support for Apple’s tap-to-pay\nplatform. Notably, Lowe’s — Home Depot’s biggest competitor — <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/12/26/long-time-holdout-lowes-finally-begins-rolling-out-apple-pay-support/\">began rolling out Apple Pay support</a> last December. It\ncertainly seems possible that this move by Lowe’s put pressure on\nHome Depot to change its strategy.</p>\n\n<p>Home Depot hasn’t commented on this change in policy, and the\ndetails of the rollout aren’t explicitly clear. It appears to be a\nvery gradual rollout that started at a small number of locations\nover the summer and has recently picked up momentum. Your mileage\nmay vary for the time being, though.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I could be completely wrong, but I don’t think Home Depot was ever opposed to Apple Pay. I just think they bought into a weird point-of-sale system that didn’t support it. They’re weird terminals. And I suspect what’s happening now isn’t a come-to-Jesus moment regarding Apple Pay in particular, but a replacement of those crummy POS terminals with new ones that do support Apple Pay.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Walmart is still the biggest Apple Pay holdout by a wide margin,\nand the company has shown no signs of changing its tune.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With Walmart, I do think it’s strategic that they don’t support Apple Pay. I think it’s wrongheaded though, and they’ll change their minds sooner (probably) or later. Walmart, just a few years ago, was <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/01/22/currentc\">spearheading the dumbass CurrentC “pay via QR code” system</a>. Apple Pay, from a user’s perspective, is just a private way to pay via credit or debit card — no more, no less. Whatever strategic reasons Walmart has to oppose it — which I think boil down to wanting customers to instead use a Walmart-proprietary digital payment system — aren’t worth it.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/09/home-depot-apple-pay\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2cc3831ae4126c298ab9b2dce7f8c4d2e820cb5091d87a8b97d02d00d1c6b27a","category":"Tech"}
