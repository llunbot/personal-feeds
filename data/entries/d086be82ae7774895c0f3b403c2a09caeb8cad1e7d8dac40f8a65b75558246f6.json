These are the only chips that combine AMD's latest Zen 4 CPU architecture and its latest RDNA 3 graphics cores, whereas other 7000-series laptop chips mix and match various older CPU and GPU architectures.</p>\n<p>Today, the company is announcing two new Ryzen 7040U-series chips for thin and light laptops, but with a twist: They combine regular Zen 4 CPU cores with \"Zen 4c\" cores that are designed to save space rather than hit high clock speeds (via <a href=\"https://www.anandtech.com/show/21111/amd-unveils-ryzen-7040u-series-with-zen-4c-smaller-cores-bigger-efficiency\">AnandTech</a>). AMD says that a Zen 4c CPU core has the same capabilities as a Zen 4 core but takes up 35 percent less space in a silicon die.</p>\n\n<p>These new chips are codenamed \"Phoenix 2,\" denoting that they are similar to but distinct from the original Phoenix design used in earlier Ryzen 7040U chips. Phoenix 2 combines two high-performance Zen 4 cores, four high-efficiency Zen 4c cores, and a Radeon 740M integrated GPU with four RDNA3 graphics cores. They also lack the Ryzen AI neural processing unit that accelerates some AI and machine learning tasks in the regular Phoenix chips.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980609#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980609&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d086be82ae7774895c0f3b403c2a09caeb8cad1e7d8dac40f8a65b75558246f6","category":"Tech"}
