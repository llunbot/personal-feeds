The jury in <em>Epic v. Google</em> has just delivered its verdict — and it found that Google turned its Google Play app store and \nGoogle Play Billing service into an illegal monopoly. </p>\n\n<p>The jury unanimously answered yes to every question put before \nthem — that Google has monopoly power in the Android app \ndistribution markets and in-app billing services markets, that \nGoogle did anticompetitive things in those markets, and that Epic \nwas injured by that behavior. They decided Google has an illegal \ntie between its Google Play app store and its Google Play Billing \npayment services, too, and that its distribution agreement, \nProject Hug deals with game developers and deals with OEMs were \nall anticompetitive. [...] </p>\n\n<p>Mind you, we don’t know <em>what</em> Epic has actually won quite yet — that’s up to Judge James Donato, who’ll decide what the \nappropriate remedies might be. Epic never sued for monetary \ndamages; <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/28/23980294/epic-v-google-day-12-is-done-but-not-before-some-revelations\">it wants</a> the court to tell Google that every app \ndeveloper has total freedom to introduce its own app stores and \nits own billing systems on Android, and we don’t yet know how or \neven whether the judge might grant those wishes. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s certainly big news that Epic won, but as Hollister makes clear, we have no idea what this will actually mean in practice. I’m still not quite sure what Epic even wants. Android <em>already</em> supports third-party app stores, and <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/mobile/android\">Epic already runs one</a>. I think one thing Epic wants is to force Google to allow third-party app stores to be installed without any sort of warnings or friction, which would be a disaster for device security. I’ve installed the Epic Games app on Android, and the installation and permission-granting process seems perfectly reasonable to me. It just isn’t popular.</p>\n\n<p>The other thing Epic wants is to be able to use its own payment processing for apps distributed through the Play Store and Apple’s App Store. Implementing such a payment circumvention scheme was what got them <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2021/09/epic_apple_developer_accounts\">kicked out of both stores back in 2021</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/11/epic-wins-vs-google\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"82d8d4e96abc68817a3a6ebbc30053ebc371070c022d217a35317a0c1f98dfbe","category":"Tech"}
