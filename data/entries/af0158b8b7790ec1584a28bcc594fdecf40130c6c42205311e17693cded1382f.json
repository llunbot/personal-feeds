The auction company says the VideoPad 2 headed to auction is the only surviving concept prototype, and it is estimated to fetch up to $12,000.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe three VideoPad prototypes were based on a conceptual design sketch drawn by Apple's former CEO John Sculley, but the devices were ultimately scrapped by Steve Jobs upon his return to Apple in the late 1990s, according to Bonhams.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/apple-videopad-2-prototype-closed.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe prototype VideoPad 2 features a hinged flip-top design with two screens, although the top screen appears to be missing. The device was apparently going to have a built-in camera for video conferencing, two speakers, a memory card slot, a power socket, and a phone line input, but it was ultimately never released to the public.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe prototype was purchased from an Apple engineer in Palo Alto in 1999, and it comes in its original black leather carrying case with the Newton logo, according to Bonhams. More details are <a href=\"https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/26897/lot/55/\">available on the auction website</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAlso headed to auction is an <a href=\"https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/26897/lot/48/\">early prototype of the original Macintosh</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/26897/lot/61/\">early prototype of the original iPad</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/26897/lot/44/\">handwritten letter from Steve Jobs</a>.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/20/apple-videopad-prototype-auction/\">Apple VideoPad Device Scrapped by Steve Jobs Headed to Auction</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-videopad-device-scrapped-by-steve-jobs-headed-to-auction.2318231/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=thhf1Aj3iuw:aefzD8oVykg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=thhf1Aj3iuw:aefzD8oVykg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/thhf1Aj3iuw\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"af0158b8b7790ec1584a28bcc594fdecf40130c6c42205311e17693cded1382f","category":"Apple"}
