{"title":"MacRumors Giveaway: Win an M3 iPad Air and Rock Paper Pencil Kit From Astropad","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/21/macrumors-giveaway-astropad-m3-ipad-air/","date":1742574550000,"content":"For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href=\"https://astropad.com\">Astropad</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an 11-inch M3 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> Pro, and <a href=\"https://astropad.com/product/rock-paper-pencil/\">Astropad's Rock Paper Pencil kit</a> to go with it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/rock-paper-pencil-2025-ipads.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nIf you want to draw, sketch, or take notes on your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, the Rock Paper Pencil kit is a must have. It's the best way to match the feel of writing on paper, and it makes using an ‌iPad‌ as a writing surface much more pleasant.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/astropad-rock-paper-pencil-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nRock Paper Pencil is an all-in-one kit that includes a textured screen protector and a special tip that connects to the ‌Apple Pencil‌. This combination turns the glossy, unnatural feel of writing on an ‌iPad‌ into a natural, paper-like experience. Not only does it feel like writing on paper, it <em>sounds</em> like writing on paper, plus you get more control over stroke output because of the friction from the added texture.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/astropad-rock-paper-pencil-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nAstropad's screen protector uses NanoCling technology to adhere to the ‌iPad‌ with static cling, and you can put it on and take it off as needed with zero residue on the ‌iPad‌'s display. With the NanoCling technology, the screen protector fits right up against the display of the ‌iPad‌, providing a flat surface with no ridges or gaps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/astropad-rock-paper-pencil-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nRock Paper Pencil's tip fits on the ‌Apple Pencil‌ Pro and other ‌Apple Pencil‌ models, and it is able to hold up to heavy daily use. It has a wear-resistant copper alloy core with a palladium exterior coating, and the size is equivalent to an 0.7mm ballpoint pen for precision writing and sketching. You get two pencil tips with the kit, along with a protective storage sleeve so you can tuck away the screen protector when you're not using it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/astropad-rock-paper-pencil-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nAvailable for $45, the Rock Paper Pencil kit is compatible with Apple's new M3 ‌iPad Air‌ models, and it is also compatible with other ‌iPad‌ models. It works with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> ‌iPad Air‌, both <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models, the sixth and seventh-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> models, and the 7th-generation and later ‌iPad‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/astropad-rock-paper-pencil-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nAstropad is offering a 128GB 11-inch M3 ‌iPad Air‌, Rock Paper Pencil, and ‌Apple Pencil‌ Pro to one lucky <em>MacRumors</em> reader.
