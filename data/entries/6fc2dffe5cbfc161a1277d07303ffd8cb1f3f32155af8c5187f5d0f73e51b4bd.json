Last Friday, Apple released a second version of the ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware (4A362b), but it went under the radar until today when it was <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/oxjdhd/airpods_pro_beta_software_just_updated_4a362b/\">shared on Reddit</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/AirPods-Pro-Beta-Firmware.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Apple's developer website, the second ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware update adds support for Conversation Boost, a feature that was missing from the first beta.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nConversation Boost is an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a> feature that uses the beamforming microphones in the ‌AirPods Pro‌ to boost the volume level of conversations, which is ideal for those with mild to moderate hearing challenges.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe initial ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware beta added support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> Spatial Audio and Ambient Noise Reduction, two other ‌AirPods Pro‌ features that are coming in the ‌iOS 15‌ update.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOnly registered developers are able to install the ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware, and the installation process is rather complicated and requires Xcode. We have a walkthrough on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/install-airpods-pro-beta-firmware/\">installing the profile for the beta</a>, but as with all over-the-air firmware updates, it takes some time for new software to be seeded to users.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/04/airpods-pro-beta-firmware-2-conversation-boost/\">Second AirPods Pro Firmware Beta Adds Conversation Boost</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/second-airpods-pro-firmware-beta-adds-conversation-boost.2306535/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GToCgRTuzBo:ZDYdSwkTJ9E:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GToCgRTuzBo:ZDYdSwkTJ9E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/GToCgRTuzBo\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6fc2dffe5cbfc161a1277d07303ffd8cb1f3f32155af8c5187f5d0f73e51b4bd","category":"Apple"}
