At no time did I do anything that was knowingly\ninconsistent with the administration’s embargo or that would put\nanyone involved at risk.</p>\n\n<p>Reporters don’t have the final say over when a story is published\nor with what headline. The chain of events here could happen to\nany reporter tasked with reporting the news. This is why checks\nand balances exist within the editorial processes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/05/bloomberg-fires-reporter\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"be228a6f560a024644d16905a22539e7afd84eb62a35f2c8da949c26a86986df","category":"Tech"}
