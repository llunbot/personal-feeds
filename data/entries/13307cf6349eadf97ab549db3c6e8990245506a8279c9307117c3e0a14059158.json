Extra Member Add-On is priced at $7.99 per month, on top of the base subscription price. Max with ads is $9.99 per month, while the Standard plan is $16.99 per month and the Premium plan with 4K streaming is $20.99 per month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nExtra members are provided with their own account, password, and single profile, and add-on members can only watch Max on one device at a time. Max subscribers are only able to add one additional member to an account.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOnly those who subscribe to Max through WarnerMedia are able to access the Extra Member Add-On feature, and it is not available to those who have the Disney+, Hulu and Max bundle, or those who subscribe through third-party providers like app stores and TV providers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n$7.99 per month for the Extra Member Add-On is only $2 cheaper than an ad-supported plan, but the Extra Member feature has the benefit of sharing the plan of the main subscriber. So if the main subscription is the 4K Premium plan, the Extra Member can access 4K streaming and other Premium benefits for the $7.99 price.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMax will likely prohibit password sharing between multiple households in the near future, and will prompt users who attempt to use an account from more than one location to sign up for the Extra Member feature or to pay for a separate subscription.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/hbo-max/\">HBO Max</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/23/max-password-sharing-crackdown-2/\">Max Cracking Down on Password Sharing With New 'Extra Member' Feature</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/max-cracking-down-on-password-sharing-with-new-extra-member-feature.2455856/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"13307cf6349eadf97ab549db3c6e8990245506a8279c9307117c3e0a14059158","category":"Apple"}
