In late March, <em>The New York Times</em> cited Apple employees who were concerned about the usefulness and the price point headset. Some questioned whether the device is a \"solution in search of a problem,\" unlike the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>. There are also worries that it is not \"driven by the same clarity\" as other Apple devices.  \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/apple-ceo-tim-cook-teases-ar-vr-headset/\">earlier this week said</a> that there have been \"loads of skeptics\" with everything that the company has done, but that Apple has succeeded anyway. \"If you do something that's on edge, it will always have skeptics,\" he said. Cook said that Apple is \"not interested in putting together pieces of somebody else's stuff,\" and that in markets it enters, the company wants to \"control the primary technology.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile Kuo suggested in late March that Apple's AR/VR headset might <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/30/kuo-apple-headset-may-not-appear-at-wwdc/\">not make an appearance</a> at WWDC because Apple had pushed back its mass production timeline, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/gurman-apple-still-plans-headset-reveal-at-wwdc/\">on Sunday said</a> that Apple still plans to announce the device during the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2023</a> keynote. Kuo has not walked back his delay suggestion, and his note today does not include a timeline for Apple's event.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRumors indicate that the AR/VR headset will use 4K micro-OLED displays, dozens of cameras for capturing everything from a user's surroundings to their gestures and facial expressions, a lightweight, comfortable fit facilitated by an external battery, and a focus communication software. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nA full rundown on what we know about Apple's plans for the AR/VR headset, which could be called the \"Reality Pro,\" <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/\">can be found in our roundup</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/\">AR/VR Headset</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-glasses-ar-and-vr.209\">Apple Glasses, AR and VR</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/05/kuo-ar-vr-headset-announcement-last-hope/\">Kuo: Apple's AR/VR Headset Announcement is 'Last Hope' for Persuading Investors It Will Be the Next 'Star Product'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apples-ar-vr-headset-announcement-is-last-hope-for-persuading-investors-it-will-be-the-next-star-product.2385990/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dca3fb9c5663462fbaa4ad81a17dee7d05a1aa856518ef9f39f0f3173d446e21","category":"Apple"}
