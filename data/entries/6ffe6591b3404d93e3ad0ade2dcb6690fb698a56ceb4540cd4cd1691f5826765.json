Owners of the second-generation Chromecast and Chromecast Audio have noticed this week that their beloved streaming gadgets are no longer working. It appears that Google configured the devices with a single 10-year certificate that has now expired, and updating it is no simple feat. Google is looking into a fix, and there's nothing you can do in the meantime. In fact, trying to fix this yourself might only make things worse.</p>\n<p>Beginning this week, attempting to connect your phone to a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/10/the-2015-chromecast-and-chromecast-audio-small-blips-in-the-stream/\">second-gen Chromecast or Chromecast Audio</a> results in untrusted device or authentication errors. The unhelpful popup suggests this could be due to outdated firmware, which is technically true. Some wondered if this was simply Google's way of putting the decade-old device out to pasture.</p>\n<p>One <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/comments/1j7caui/did_google_just_brick_the_2nd_gen_chromecast/mgzdt1u/\">industrious Redditor</a> has identified the dongle's certificate chain with a line reading \"NotAfter: Mar 9 16:44:39 2025 GMT.\" Google may have included a 10-year certificate with the intention of updating it, or perhaps plans to switch to a rotating certificate fell through the cracks, or maybe no one had a plan because Google didn't expect these $35 devices to still be so popular a decade later—all things are possible in Google product support.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/googles-10-year-old-chromecast-is-busted-but-a-fix-is-coming/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/googles-10-year-old-chromecast-is-busted-but-a-fix-is-coming/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6ffe6591b3404d93e3ad0ade2dcb6690fb698a56ceb4540cd4cd1691f5826765","category":"Tech"}
