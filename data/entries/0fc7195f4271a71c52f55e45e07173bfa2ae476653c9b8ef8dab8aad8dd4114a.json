If you've already received one of the new devices, let us know in the comments below and make sure to share pictures and your initial thoughts!\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith no retail stores in New Zealand, customers in Australia are the first to be able to pick up new devices or purchase an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> in an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a>. Available in-store stock in Australia will provide insight into what we can expect in other Apple Stores around the world, but so far, there have been no rumors of shortages.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ orders did sell out during the pre-order period, and online shipping estimates now range into October. If you missed pre-orders, you can likely get one of the new devices at an ‌Apple Store‌ or a nearby location like Target, Walmart, or Best Buy.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFollowing New Zealand and Australia, sales and deliveries of the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> models and the new Apple Watches will begin in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and finally, North America. Many Apple Stores worldwide will be opening up early at around 8:00 a.m. local time to allow customers to pick up reserved devices and make walk-in purchases.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMake sure to stay tuned to <em>MacRumors</em>, as we'll have a hands-on and unboxing tomorrow, followed by deep dives into the feature set of the new devices, camera comparisons, and more.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16\">iPhone 16 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro\">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/19/iphone-16-now-arriving-to-customers/\">iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro Orders Start Arriving to Customers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-and-iphone-16-pro-orders-start-arriving-to-customers.2437125/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0fc7195f4271a71c52f55e45e07173bfa2ae476653c9b8ef8dab8aad8dd4114a","category":"Apple"}
