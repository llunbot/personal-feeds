Nevertheless, a mini-LED iPad mini certainly remains plausible as Apple expands the display technology across its product lineup, starting with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro earlier this year and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/01/mini-led-suppliers-ramp-up-new-macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro likely next</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and Debby Wu previously reported that the new iPad mini <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ipad-mini-redesign-coming-2021/\">will be announced later this year</a>, and mini-LED display-related component shipments kicking off in the third quarter of the year lends credence to that timeframe.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>9to5Mac</em>'s Chance Miller recently reported that the next iPad mini will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/ipad-mini-6-a15-chip-and-smart-connector/\">also feature the same A15 chip as the upcoming iPhone 13 lineup</a>, and a Smart Connector for easily connecting compatible keyboards, while leaker Jon Prosser said the device will sport <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/11/ipad-mini-6-thinner-bezels-usb-c-rumor/\">dramatically improved speakers and have compatibility with a new, smaller Apple Pencil</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe current iPad mini was released in March 2019 and features a 7.9-inch display, an A12 chip, and a Touch ID home button.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini 5</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">digitimes.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mini-led/\">Mini-LED</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/22/ipad-mini-with-mini-led-display-rumor/\">Next-Generation iPad Mini Will Reportedly Feature a Mini-LED Display</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-generation-ipad-mini-will-reportedly-feature-a-mini-led-display.2305105/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=O0XY50sHO5w:1YYBVMZAn4Y:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=O0XY50sHO5w:1YYBVMZAn4Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/O0XY50sHO5w\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c4e784610adcc9da4840b3729d6d6858c612ab825711f451085837d973efd2db","category":"Apple"}
