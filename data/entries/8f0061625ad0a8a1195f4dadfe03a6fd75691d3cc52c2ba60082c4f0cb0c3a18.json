It's intended to isolate dialogue and make it louder relative to other sounds in streaming videos on the service.</p>\n<p>Amazon describes how it works in a <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/prime-video-dialogue-boost\">blog post</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dialogue Boost analyzes the original audio in a movie or series and intelligently identifies points where dialogue may be hard to hear above background music and effects. Then, speech patterns are isolated and audio is enhanced to make the dialogue clearer. This AI-based approach delivers a targeted enhancement to portions of spoken dialogue, instead of a general amplification at the center channel in a home theater system.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Not all content will be eligible for the dialogue boost feature, thoughâ€”at least not yet. Amazon says it \"has initially launched on select Amazon Originals worldwide\" like <em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</em> and <em>The Big Sick</em>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933438#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933438&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8f0061625ad0a8a1195f4dadfe03a6fd75691d3cc52c2ba60082c4f0cb0c3a18","category":"Tech"}
