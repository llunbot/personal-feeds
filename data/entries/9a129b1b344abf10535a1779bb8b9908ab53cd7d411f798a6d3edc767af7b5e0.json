{"title":"Next iPad Pro Might Support MagSafe Charging","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/","date":1702928501000,"content":"The next-generation version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> that's set to come out in 2024 might include support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> charging, <em>MacRumors</em> has heard. The information comes from a source that is familiar with companies that manufacture magnets for Apple products, and while it's not confirmed at this time, there have been past rumors pointing toward Apple's work on wireless charging for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPad-Pro-Magsafe-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nBack in 2021, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ipad-pro-2022-wireless-charging-capabilities/\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> said that Apple was considering a glass back for the 2022 ‌iPad Pro‌, allowing for wireless charging capabilities. Gurman specifically said that Apple was testing a ‌MagSafe‌ system for the ‌iPad Pro‌. The 2022 ‌iPad Pro‌ models did not feature wireless charging, a glass back, or notable design changes, but it is possible that Apple tabled the feature for a future launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNew 11.1 and 13-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ models with OLED displays are planned for 2024, and the devices are expected to get design updates as part of that refresh. Apple has not updated the look of the ‌iPad Pro‌ in several years, so it is due for an overhaul.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is possible that Apple could be planning for a glass-backed ‌iPad Pro‌ in 2024 as part of the OLED refresh, but that has not been confirmed. A glass back would make the ‌iPad Pro‌ more vulnerable to damage when dropped, similar to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, but it would also allow for new wire-free accessories and a common ‌MagSafe‌ charger that would work for both the ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌. The ‌iPad‌ would also presumably work with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/anker-qi2-15w-charging/\">15W magnetic Qi2 chargers</a> that third-party manufacturers are working on.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n15W ‌MagSafe‌ charging would be slower than wired charging over USB-C, which is also the case with the ‌iPhone‌, but it would provide Apple device owners with more charging options in a pinch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is also a chance that the ‌MagSafe‌ charging for the ‌iPad‌ that we're hearing about refers to a Mac-like magnetic charger rather than an iPhone-style magnetic charger. Apple is working on a more Mac-like aluminum Magic Keyboard for the 2024 ‌iPad Pro‌ launch, and the new iPads will also use the same M3 chips that are in the MacBook Pro.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/\">Next iPad Pro Might Support MagSafe Charging</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-ipad-pro-might-support-magsafe-charging.2414077/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9a129b1b344abf10535a1779bb8b9908ab53cd7d411f798a6d3edc767af7b5e0","category":"Apple"}
