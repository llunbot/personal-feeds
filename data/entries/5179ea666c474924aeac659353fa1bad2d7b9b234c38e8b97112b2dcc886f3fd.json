You can get many of these wearables for <a href=\"https://howl.me/ck7qldLGUDG\"><strong>$639.00</strong></a>, down from $799.00, while a few other models are on sale for a slightly higher price of $659.00.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://howl.me/ck7qldLGUDG\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$160 OFF</div>Apple Watch Ultra 1 for $639.00</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis beats the best sale seen on the Apple Watch Ultra 2 by about $100, so if you're willing to adopt a previous generation model it's the best way to save the most amount of money.
