{"title":"Announcing AWS Well-Architected Custom Lenses: Extend the Well-Architected Framework with Your Internal Best Practices","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/well-architected-custom-lenses-internal-best-practices/","date":1638205350000,"content":"<p>We <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/are-you-well-architected/\">launched the AWS Well-Architected Framework</a> back in 2015 to help you review workloads against architectural best practices, and across pillars such as operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization. In 2017, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/well-architected-lens-focus-on-specific-workload-types/\">we extended the framework with the concept of “lenses”</a> to optimize specific workload types such as the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/welcome.html\">Serverless Lens</a>, the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/saas-lens/saas-lens.html\">SaaS Lens</a>, and the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/partners/foundational-technical-review/\">Foundational Technical Review (FTR) Lens</a> for APN Partners. In 2018, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-well-architected-tool-review-workloads-against-best-practices/\">we launched the AWS Well-Architected Tool</a>, a self-service tool designed to help you review AWS workloads at any time, without the need for an AWS Solutions Architect.</p> \n<p>Today, I’m happy to announce the general availability of AWS Well-Architected Custom Lenses, a new feature of the AWS Well-Architected Tool that lets you bring your own best practices to complement the existing framework based on your industry, operational plans, and internal processes. Custom Lenses provide a consolidated view and a consistent way to measure and improve your workloads on AWS without relying on external spreadsheets or third-party systems.</p> \n<p>In addition to AWS Well-Architected Lenses, now you can create and share custom lenses and include them in your workload reviews, ultimately tailoring the review to your organizational needs. For example, you could define a custom lens to review your workloads against PCI compliance, SOC 2 compliance, or other national or industry regulations. As an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/partners/programs/well-architected/\">AWS Partner</a>, you might include ad-hoc best practices in your custom lenses when reviewing workloads with customers from different industries and segments, ultimately making the review process easier, faster, and more comprehensive.</p> \n<p><span><strong>How to Define a new Custom Lens</strong></span><br /> You author a new custom lens by editing a JSON preset template, where you define questions, choices, helpful resources, improvement plans, and risk rules.</p> \n<p>Here’s how it works: <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/home?#/lenses/create\">download the template</a> from the AWS Well-Architected Tool, work on it locally, and then re-upload it.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/11/04/aws-well-architected-custom-lens-upload-1024x820.png\" /></p> \n<p>The JSON structure is composed of multiple pillars. Each pillar might contain multiple questions, each with its own choices and risk rules.</p> \n<p>Your JSON file will look like this:</p> \n<pre><code>{\n    \"schemaVersion\": \"2021-11-01\",\n    \"name\": \"My Test Lens\",\n    \"description\": \"This is a description of my test lens.\",\n    \"pillars\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"pillar_red\",\n            \"name\": \"Red Pillar\",\n            \"questions\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"pillar_1_q1\",\n                    \"title\": \"How do you get started with this pillar?\",\n                    \"description\": \"Optional description.\",\n                    \"choices\": [\n                        {\n                            \"id\": \"choice1\",\n                            \"title\": \"Best practice #1\",\n                            \"helpfulResource\": {\n                                \"displayText\": \"This is helpful text for the first choice.\",\n                                \"url\": \"https://aws.amazon.com\"\n                            },\n                            \"improvementPlan\": {\n                                \"displayText\": \"This is text that will be shown for improvement of this choice.\"\n                            }\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"id\": \"choice2\",\n                            \"title\": \"Best practice #2\",\n                            ...\n                        }\n                    ],\n                    \"riskRules\": [\n                        {\n                            \"condition\": \"choice1 &amp;&amp; choice2\",\n                            \"risk\": \"NO_RISK\"\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"condition\": \"choice1 &amp;&amp; !choice2\",\n                            \"risk\": \"MEDIUM_RISK\"\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"condition\": \"default\",\n                            \"risk\": \"HIGH_RISK\"\n                        }\n                    ]\n                }\n            ]\n            ...\n        },\n        ...\n    ]\n}</code></pre> \n<p>Once you’re ready to submit your JSON file, proceed with the upload.</p> \n<p>And don’t worry about making it perfect on the first try. You’ll be able to improve it and add new versions.</p> \n<p><span><strong>AWS Well-Architected Custom Lenses in Action</strong></span><br /> You find the list of custom lenses and their latest version in the new <strong>Custom Lenses</strong> section.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/11/11/well-architected-custom-lens-list-1024x404.png\" /></p> \n<p>Each custom lens has an owner and can be shared with multiple AWS accounts too.</p> \n<p>Before using this new custom lens in a workload review, you’ll need to publish it and assign it a version.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/11/11/well-architected-custom-lens-draft-detail-1024x756.png\" /></p> \n<p>Select <strong>Publish lens</strong> and provide a version name such as <code>1.0</code>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/11/11/well-architected-custom-lens-publish-1024x411.png\" /></p> \n<p>Now you can create a new workload review and apply both AWS-owned lenses and your own custom lenses, in addition to the main framework.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/11/11/well-architected-custom-lens-workflow-1024x784.png\" /></p> \n<p>During the workload review, you will go through each pillar and questions of the custom lens, using the same user interface provided by the AWS Well-Architected Tool.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/11/11/well-architected-custom-lens-review-1024x638.png\" /></p> \n<p>Last but not least, you can share your custom lens with other <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> principals such as AWS accounts, IAM users, and IAM roles.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/11/11/well-architected-custom-lens-share-1024x758.png\" /></p> \n<p><strong><span>Available Today at No Charge</span></strong><br /> Custom Lenses are available today in all AWS Regions where the AWS Well-Architected Tool is available, at no cost.
