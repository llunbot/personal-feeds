It's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/heres-our-first-look-at-kias-ev9-three-row-electric-suv/\">the EV9</a>, a three-row SUV that uses the company's E-GMP architecture, also used to good effect in smaller EVs like the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/kias-new-ev6-electric-crossover-goes-straight-to-the-head-of-the-pack/\">Kia EV6</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/12/the-hyundai-ioniq-5-is-the-best-ev-weve-driven-in-2021/\">Hyundai Ioniq 5</a>. When the EV9 arrives in showrooms, the range will start at $54,900 (plus destination charge).</p>\n<p>\"We knew we had to get the EV9 pricing right, and we believe today's announcement will be a wake-up call to the industry,\" said Kia America's COO, Steve Center.</p>\n<p>\"A well-equipped three-row SUV EV doesn’t have to be prohibitively expensive. It should offer the perfect balance of standard features, the ability to fast charge, and be equipped with the technology savvy EV buyers are looking for. The EV9 provides all of this, and we can’t wait for it to go on sale later this year,\" he said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971817#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971817&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
