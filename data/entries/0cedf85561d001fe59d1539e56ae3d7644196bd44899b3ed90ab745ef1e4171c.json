climb?</a></p>\n\n<p>Rather like a single chapter in a book, it might seem slightly wrong to consider the Koppenberg in isolation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s probably the most famous Flemish cobbled climb (although you could spend many nights and get through a lot of La Chouffe beer debating that) but in some ways it owes much of that to its Belgian brethren.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other chapters such as the Paterberg, Taaienberg, Eikenberg, Oude Kwaremont and Kapelmuur are all needed to make up the full, fantastic story of the Ronde van Vlaanderen – the Tour of Flanders.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img

the nuances of a single inclined stretch of cobbles, and this particular hill near Oudenaarde is somehow representative of all that’s tough, yet tantalisingly attractive, about the climbs that captivate the cycling world each spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Curiously, despite its status, the Koppenberg has only been a part of the Tour of Flanders since the mid-1970s.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img
