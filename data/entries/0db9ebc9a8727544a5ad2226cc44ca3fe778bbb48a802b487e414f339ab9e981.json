I am not sure who is in whose space. Either way, bugs will come flying at you and hit you in the face, arms, stomach, everywhere. I’m not talking about small little flies, but whopping great beasts flying into you at a rate of knots. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be rather surprising and, in some cases, hurt, especially when you get smacked right on the nose as I did – I definitely looked like Rudolph for a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.

That might be a shaded bench telling you to take a few minutes off the bike or a water fountain reminding you to drink.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me it was a mixture of things. I saw a dragonfly every single day, white butterflies often came and said hello when I was feeling a bit lacklustre, and red flowers would pop up on the road side when I needed a booster. Plus, when I wasn’t sure if I was allowed on the track (England and its strict rules hey) another cyclist or a walker would come into view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These little things, however small, really, really help, so keep an eye out for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.

OK, I wouldn’t advise having a long lunch but taking a few moments to relax, eat, drink and take in your surroundings is so much more worthwhile in the long term than pushing on. For an 18-day trip it’s all about longevity and keeping your body and mind going, and rest stops are an integral part to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4.

To keep things fairly clean, rinse a pair of bibs every morning and strap them to the back of your bike so they can dry during the day. Thus you will have one pair of sort-of-clean but definitely dry bibs on rotation and a happy butt.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Check out our guides to the best <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&amp;cx=1c295d80662f8b79d&amp;q=https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-womens-bibshorts-buyers-guide&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjOgKfA_ur_AhWuaqQEHUBACAgQFnoECAAQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw0OO3gjswfHYSFvgFiCA94n\" target=\"_blank\">women’s </a>and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-cycling-bibshorts\" target=\"_blank\">men’s </a>bib shorts for cycling</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.

Even though I drank a lot, and kept myself hydrated for much of the route, as much liquid as I drank, I still suffered on a fair few of the days. At first I didn’t actually understand why I had a sandpaper sensation in my mouth, but then again I’ve never experienced dry mouth, and I’ve also never cycled for 18 days without a rest in 30 degree heat.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6.
