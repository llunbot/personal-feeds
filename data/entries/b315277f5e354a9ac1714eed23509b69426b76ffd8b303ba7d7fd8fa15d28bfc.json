So today’s deal is a great one: <a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-apple-polishing-cloth\">Amazon’s Woot is selling Apple’s Polishing Cloth for an incredible $7</a>, a massive savings of 63 percent ($12) on its usual price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The off-white cloth is made of a “soft, nonabrasive material” that’s perfect for “safely and effectively” wiping down all of the screens on your iPads, iPhones, Apple Watch, and MacBooks, even nano-texture ones. Of course, you can also use it to wipe clean other screens as well—TVs, monitors, Nintendo Switch, etc, as well as removing streaks and smudges from eyeglasses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While $19 for a polishing cloth is ra bit steep, paying $7 for one doesn’t seem that dramatic. If you need more of these, there’s a 10-per-customer limit over at Woot. Just note, Woot’s deals come with an expiration date. This one, for instance, has six more days of availability or until stocks run out. If you’re on Amazon Prime, you’ll even get free shipping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go ahead and get yourself a fancy new <a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-apple-polishing-cloth\">Apple polishing cloth from Woot for $7</a> while the deal still stands.</p>\n\n\n<span>Get Apple's Polishing Cloth for just $7</span><div><a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-apple-polishing-cloth\" target=\"_blank\">But now at Woot!</a></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b315277f5e354a9ac1714eed23509b69426b76ffd8b303ba7d7fd8fa15d28bfc","category":"Apple"}
