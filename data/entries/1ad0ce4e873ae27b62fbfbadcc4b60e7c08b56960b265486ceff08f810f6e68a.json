After being warned that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/auto-industry-braces-for-chaos-as-trump-sets-25-tariff-on-all-imports/\">his trade war</a> will result in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/how-automakers-like-ford-vw-stellantis-are-reacting-to-trumps-25-tariff/\">hiked prices</a> and fewer vehicles being built, government officials over the past two days have signaled that Trump will sign an executive order today that will mitigate some of the pain the 25 percent import tariffs will inflict.</p>\n<p>Trump's approach to tariffs has been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/09/trump-backs-down-on-tariffs/\">nothing if not inconsistent</a>.
