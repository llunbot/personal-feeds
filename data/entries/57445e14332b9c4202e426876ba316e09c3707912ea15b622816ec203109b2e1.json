Stark is a veteran of the emulator field and has been making retro game emulators on mobile for over 15 years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's worth noting that while Gamma is free to download and contains no iAPs (as per <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/app-store-guidelines-emulators-music-app-links/\">Apple's emulator rules</a>) its <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gamma-game-emulator/id6499106870?platform=iphone\">App Store page</a> says that it collects identifiers that can be used to track you, and may collect location and usage data. <br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/gamma-ps1-emulator-released-iphone/\">Gamma Emulator Brings Classic PS1 Gaming to iPhone and iPad</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gamma-emulator-brings-classic-ps1-gaming-to-iphone-and-ipad.2426173/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"57445e14332b9c4202e426876ba316e09c3707912ea15b622816ec203109b2e1","category":"Apple"}
