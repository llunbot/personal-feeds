With the new changes, Apple now only highlights the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>, which now comes in brand new colors. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple announced ‌HomePod‌ in 2018 as its first major home-centric product, focused around delivering high-quality audio combined with the integration into services, such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPriced at $349 at launch and eventually decreased to $299, Apple struggled to market the ‌HomePod‌ in a way appealing to the masses, yielding lower sales than the company was likely aiming for. Additionally, ‌Siri‌, which powers the ‌HomePod‌ experience, continues to grapple with catching up to the capabilities of Google's smart assistant and Amazon's Alexa.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple followed up the full-sized ‌HomePod‌ with the ‌HomePod mini‌ last year, and today added new colors for the smaller speaker. The ‌HomePod mini‌ features a significantly smaller design than the original ‌HomePod‌, but continues to feature the same ‌Siri‌ experience, powered by ‌Apple Music‌ and third-party services. Unlike the original ‌HomePod‌ selling for $299, the ‌HomePod mini‌ is priced at $99. The ‌HomePod mini‌ recently became available in more countries, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/15/homepod-mini-in-austria-new-zealand-ireland/\">Austria, Ireland</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/22/homepod-mini-launches-in-new-zealand/\">New Zealand</a>. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2021-apple-event/\">October 2021 Apple Event</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/homepod-website-references-removed/\">Apple Removes References to Original HomePod From Website, Months After Discontinuation</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-removes-references-to-original-homepod-from-website-months-after-discontinuation.2317611/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QPRpZYmP0i8:HsHMJp0sM5M:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QPRpZYmP0i8:HsHMJp0sM5M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/QPRpZYmP0i8\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5b780a27f5319785e280b9ea7ff6913e29f5937c0d151450d6f2ae2ac3664c58","category":"Apple"}
