High Power Mode can be enabled in System Preferences under Battery &gt; Power Adapter &gt; Energy Mode when connected to a power source or under Battery &gt; Battery &gt; Energy Mode when running on battery.  \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHigh Power Mode is designed to maximize performance during intensive, sustained workloads <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/22/high-power-mode-16-inch-macbook-pro-m1-max/\">such as color grading 8K ProRes video</a>, according to Apple. Fine print in System Preferences indicates that High Power Mode may result in louder fan noise, suggesting that the feature allows the M1 Max chip to run hotter and ramps up fan speeds to accommodate this.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/high-power-mode-macos.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nHigh Power Mode is not available on the 14-inch MacBook Pro, even when configured with an M1 Max chip, or on any models with an M1 Pro chip.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTong tested High Power Mode on the 16-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 Max chip by exporting a 19-minute video in Adobe Premiere Pro version 15.4.1. The export took 7 minutes and 18 seconds, which was just 16 seconds faster than the same export took with High Power Mode turned off, so there wasn't a significant difference in performance in this particular test, but High Power Mode could have more benefit with other workflows.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTong also said the bottom of the MacBook Pro was noticeably hotter to the touch while he tested High Power Mode compared to normal usage.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/black-apple-stickers.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nMeanwhile, Dave Lee's review reveals that the new MacBook Pro models include black Apple logo stickers in the box rather than standard white stickers, as Apple associates the color black with its professional line of products.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nWe've seen Apple experiment with colors before. The new 24-inch iMac, for example, includes <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/21/m1-imac-hands-on/\">color-matching Apple stickers</a> in the box.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">14 &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/25/macbook-pro-high-power-mode-system-preferences/\">MacBook Pro Reviews Provide First Look at High Power Mode, Black Apple Stickers Included in Box</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-pro-reviews-provide-first-look-at-high-power-mode-black-apple-stickers-included-in-box.2319216/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=B7_ZoXdbw28:NT1hw6bTKi8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=B7_ZoXdbw28:NT1hw6bTKi8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/B7_ZoXdbw28\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f89a28127c69fb7f5eca44043edd997860c94e748ebc6a2f372ebb1c7356fa1c","category":"Apple"}
