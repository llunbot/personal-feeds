The update (version number 22000.346, for the record) fixes rendering problems with the new Taskbar and Start menu, some Bluetooth audio volume control problems, issues running some 32-bit apps, and a variety of printer problems, among many other things.</p>\n\n<p>Buried amongst its other, more important tweaks is the rollback of one of Windows 11's cosmetic additions: the \"<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559852/microsoft-windows-11-black-blue-screen-of-death-bsod-change\">Black Screen of Death</a>.\" This update will change the color of this system-killing error screen back to blue, \"as in previous versions of Windows\" (and as the computer gods intended).</p>\n<p>The Blue Screen of Death (or BSoD) has become iconic in its own right, with <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PBSOD/\">a fairly active Reddit community</a> dedicated to spotting it and other computer errors out in the wild. It's a reminder thatÂ beneath the shiny artifice of our screen-filled modern existence lurks a bunch of decrepit PCs that, like pandemic-era humanity, are often just barely holding it together.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1812725#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1812725&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f6b25caa37b86a000b5f84e9334e452973c2d2da67d091a996f79d8134629c34","category":"Tech"}
