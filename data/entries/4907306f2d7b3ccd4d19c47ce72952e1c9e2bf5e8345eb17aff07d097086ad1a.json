Often there are a few retro builds, some custom paint jobs, and possibly some prototypes to be found. In the retro department, Devinci stole the show with their Big Bang DH bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There weren’t as many custom paint jobs as usual this year, but Trek had one of Cam McCaul’s bikes at their booth. Devinci also had a brightly colored Spartan and full-face helmet that were custom-painted to make a pretty awesome giveaway prize.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trek Slash+ Prototype and Cam McCaul’s 20<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Bike:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Trek-prototype-Slash-Plus.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Trek-prototype-Slash-Plus.jpg\" alt=\"Trek Slash+ prototype\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Trek-prototype-Slash-Plus.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Trek-prototype-Slash-Plus-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Trek-prototype-Slash-Plus-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Trek-prototype-Slash-Plus-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re trying to keep a prototype on the down low, it gets a plain paint job that won’t attract attention… well, maybe. This unmarked white eMTB is in fact a prototype of the just-released <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-trek-slash-plus-ebike-tq-motor-bigger-battery/\">Slash+</a>. It belongs to one of the engineers who was instrumental in the Slash+’s design.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Trek-Cam-McCaul-20th-Fuel-EX.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Trek-Cam-McCaul-20th-Fuel-EX.jpg\" alt=\"Trek Cam McCaul 20th anniversary Fuel EX\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Trek-Cam-McCaul-20th-Fuel-EX.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Trek-Cam-McCaul-20th-Fuel-EX-225x300.jpg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Trek-Cam-McCaul-20th-Fuel-EX-90x120.jpg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Trek-Cam-McCaul-20th-Fuel-EX-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Trek-Cam-McCaul-20th-Fuel-EX-1152x1536.jpg 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also hanging up at <a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/?clear=true\">Trek</a>’s booth was this custom Fuel EX, made to celebrate Cam McCauls’ 20<sup>th</sup> year as a Trek rider. The chrome was inspired by one of McCauls’ favorite bikes from his past, and it’s joined by a textured green paint effect on the frame’s front end.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was also told a certain very famous slopestyle legend has his 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary bike coming next year… I’ll be looking for it!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Devinci Big Bang:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Devinci-Big-Bang-DH-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Devinci-Big-Bang-DH-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Devinci Big Bang DH bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Devinci-Big-Bang-DH-bike.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Devinci-Big-Bang-DH-bike-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Devinci-Big-Bang-DH-bike-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Devinci-Big-Bang-DH-bike-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.devinci.com/en/\">Devinci Cycles</a> had this retro Big Bang downhill bike at their booth. The bike is owned by Devinci’s Sea-To-Sky Sales Rep Steve Mitchell, who owns a museum-worthy collection of bikes. Mitchell recently raced this Big Bang at the Psychosis DH race, in a special class for retro bikes. While every part of this bike is a throwback to earlier times, I’d say the Shimano Airlines air-powered shifting system is the icing on the cake!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The title shot shows a custom-painted Devinci Spartan and ABUS full-face helmet. The paint jobs on both were done by Fresh Paints of Whistler, B.C. The bike features a pink and blue palette with happy faces and bubbly logos, and the helmet features matching text and logos on a white shell. One lucky contest entrant will win this killer combo!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Norco VPS-1:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Norco-VPS-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Norco-VPS-1.jpg\" alt=\"Norco VPS-1\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Norco-VPS-1.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Norco-VPS-1-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Norco-VPS-1-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Norco-VPS-1-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It was just announced that the family of Norco Bicycles Founder Bert Lewis just assumed ownership of the company. For the past 60 years, Live to Play Sports Group has been independently owned and operated in a partnership of the Lewis and the Zalkow families. As of July 1, the Lewis family has assumed full ownership of LTP Sports Group Inc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To celebrate a bit of their history, <a href=\"https://www.norco.com/\">Norco</a> had a VPS-1 at their booth, showing the best freeride/North Shore technology we had in the late 1990’s. Downhill bikes were in the primitive stages of full-suspension designs, with the VPS-1 offering what was then considered tons of rear travel at 5.5-6.5”. I can’t decide if I hate the giant saddle or the double telescoping seat post more! Thank goodness for advances in bike technology!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/crankworx-whistler-custom-retro-and-prototype-bikes/\">Crankworx Whistler: Custom, Retro and Prototype Bikes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"4907306f2d7b3ccd4d19c47ce72952e1c9e2bf5e8345eb17aff07d097086ad1a","category":"Cycling"}
