The power of 65 watts is distributed across the three ports. USB-C1 and USB-C2 deliver a maximum of 65 watts when only one device is connected, while USB-A delivers 18 watts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With two devices connected, the distribution is as follows: C1 45 watts and C2 20 watts, or C1 45 watts and USB-A 18 watts. If devices are connected to C2 and USB-A, only 15 watts are available together. With three devices, C1 and C2 share 45 watts and USB-A can provide 15 watts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We tested the charging performance with Apple devices. An iPhone 15 was charged by 52 percent after 30 minutes, an 11-inch iPad Pro by 35 percent, and a M 3MacBook Air by 49 percent. These are good values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laut also supplies matching <a href=\"https://www.itslaut.eu/de/collections/all-cables/products/link-usb-c-to-usb-c-cable-1-5-meter-60w?variant=45649649303819\" target=\"_blank\">charging cables</a> with its charger, which impressed us in practice with their flexibility and price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unspectacular at first glance, the Universal Pro 65W impresses with its high charging power and uncritical thermal behavior. The design is compact enough to fit the Universal Pro 65W in any bag. The soft-touch housing is not only pleasant to the touch, but also pleasing with its curves. Much more important, however, are the three ports.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c14443674eb079d767f3c4d9a4c5104d97e692e002d47a966a30f26d7959d784","category":"Apple"}
