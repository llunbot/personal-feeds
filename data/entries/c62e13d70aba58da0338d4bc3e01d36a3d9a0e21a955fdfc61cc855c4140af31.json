With up to 10 CPU and GPU cores and support for up to 32GB of memory, it easily handles lightweight workflows without draining battery life excessively. Devices like the ‌iPad Pro‌, 14-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌, ‌Mac mini‌, and ‌iMac‌ offer this chip, providing great value for those prioritizing efficiency over intensive workflows.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor users who frequently handle intensive applications and multitasking but don't have extreme performance demands, the M4 Pro strikes an excellent balance. With its added CPU and GPU cores, faster memory bandwidth, and support for Thunderbolt 5, the M4 Pro is a smart choice for video editing, graphic design, and advanced multitasking. It's available in both the ‌Mac mini‌ and the 14- and 16-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFinally, the M4 Max is engineered for power users with high-performance needs, such as 3D rendering, complex data processing, or heavy-duty video production. With up to 16 CPU cores, 40 GPU cores, and 128GB of unified memory, the M4 Max is equipped to handle the most intensive workflows. It's a good fit for those who require top-tier performance across the CPU and GPU. It is currently exclusively available in Apple's 14- and 16-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ models.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4/\">M4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-imac/\">M4 iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/\">M4 Mac mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-studio/\">M4 Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macbook-pro/\">M4 MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macs/\">M4 Macs</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-vs-m4-pro-vs-m4-max/\">M4 vs. M4 Pro vs. M4 Max Chip Buyer's Guide: Which Should You Choose?</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-vs-m4-pro-vs-m4-max-chip-buyers-guide-which-should-you-choose.2441598/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c62e13d70aba58da0338d4bc3e01d36a3d9a0e21a955fdfc61cc855c4140af31","category":"Apple"}
