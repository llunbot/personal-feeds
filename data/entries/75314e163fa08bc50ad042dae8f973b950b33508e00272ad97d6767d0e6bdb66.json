{"title":"The 40th Anniversary of ProVUE at Macworld Expo","link":"https://forum.provue.com/t/celebrating-the-40th-anniversary-of-provue-at-macworld-expo/6871","date":1740187984000,"content":"\n<p>Jim Rea:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Forty years ago today the doors opened for the <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/oursf/article/Photos-of-the-first-Macworld-in-1985-and-why-15880682.php\">very first\nMacworld Expo</a> in the Brooks Hall basement in San Francisco.\nFor most of you this event probably seems like ancient history,\nsomewhere back in the mists of time. But for me this was a very\nreal and exciting event that I participated in as an exhibitor,\nthe start of my amazing journey with the Mac community, a journey\nthat continues on today.</p>\n\n<p>As I recall there were two or three dozen software booths that\nfirst year. Some of the software on display included\n<a href=\"http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/multiplan-10\">Multiplan</a> (Microsoft), <a href=\"http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/pfsfile-pfsreport\">PFS:File</a>, <a href=\"http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/thinktank-128\">Think\nTank</a>, <a href=\"http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/filevision\">FileVision</a>, <a href=\"http://macintoshgarden.org/games/mac-slots\">Mac Slots</a>,\n<a href=\"http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/habadex\">Habadex</a>, <a href=\"http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/macdraft-12\">Mac Draft</a>, <a href=\"http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/maclion\">Mac Lion</a>, <a href=\"http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/musicworks\">Music\nWorks</a>, <a href=\"http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/clickart-publications\">Click Art</a> and of course\n<a href=\"http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/overvue\">OverVUE</a> (the direct predecessor to today’s Panorama\nX). Of course all of these companies have long since\ndisappeared, except for two — Microsoft and ProVUE Development.\nI’d say that’s a pretty nice club.</p>\n\n<p>I’m quite proud to have kept ProVUE Development in the Macintosh\ndatabase business every single day from then to now. The RAM based\ndatabase concepts I started with in 1984 are still the core of the\nsoftware today, of course much further developed. In fact, if you\nlook at screen shots of the original OverVUE from 1984, and\nPanorama X from 2025, the family resemblance is unmistakeable. On\nthe left is 68k assembly code using the original Mac ROMs, on the\nright is Objective-C using AppKit, but the concepts are the same.\nThere are even databases that have been brought forward from the\nleft all the way to the right — in continuous use over four\ndecades!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are old-school Mac developers still going strong, and there are <em>old school</em> Mac developers still going strong. I’m not sure about this “Microsoft” company, but ProVUE’s achievement here is quite remarkable.
