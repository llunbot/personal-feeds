At the same time, Zwift will cease to sell its Hub One trainer, with the Kickr Core Hub One becoming the two brands’ single entry-level <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/the-best-turbo-trainers-a-buyers-guide\" target=\"_blank\">direct drive trainer</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its price of £549 / $599 / €599 matches that of the<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/zwift-hub-one-review\" target=\"_blank\"> Zwift Hub One </a>and the Kickr Core with a real cassette and includes a year’s Zwift subscription.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Zwift Cog allows Wahoo and Zwift to offer a solution that’s ready to ride out of the box. It comes with a handlebar-mounted controller, called the Zwift Click, which provides virtual shifting. The brands say that this allows them to offer silent shifting, 24 virtual gears and compatibility with almost all bikes with between eight and 12 speeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also provides compatibility with Wahoo’s other training hardware, including the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/wahoo-kickr-turbo-trainer-and-kom-bundle-review\" target=\"_blank\">Kickr Climb </a>and Kickr Headwind, so that you can expand your indoor training environment for a more realistic feel when riding Zwift or other <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-cycling-training-apps\"

of PR, the reasoning behind the change. Here’s his response in full: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The Wahoo Kickr Core Zwift One is actually replacing the Zwift Hub One – as the Kickr Core with Cassette replaced Zwift Classic last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We’re excited to be working with Wahoo on this trainer as it brings a number of new benefits to the customer, including slightly improved power accuracy and Wahoo Kickr Climb compatibility. Working with Wahoo means we are also able to expand the distribution of this product, meaning customers in Australia and Canada will be able to access the benefits of virtual shifting from late March. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Pricing has been kept the same as the outgoing Zwift Hub One and also includes a year of Zwift membership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Zwift Hub One will be around for a limited time while stocks last. All warranties on those trainers remain valid for their duration and Zwift is committed to continued firmware updates and support for at least two years post 7th February.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pricing and availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Zwift-Cog-970x645.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Zwift-Cog-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Zwift-Cog-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Zwift-Cog-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Zwift-Cog-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Zwift-Cog-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Zwift-Cog-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Zwift-Cog-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Zwift-Cog-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Zwift-Cog.jpg 1422w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kickr Core has seen progressive price reductions over the past year or so, so that the new Kickr Core Zwift One trainer is priced at £549 / $599 / €599 with a year’s Zwift subscription. You can buy it now in the US and Europe, with availability in Australia and Canada following in March 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you prefer real shifting using your bike’s shifters to virtual shifting using the Zwift Click controller, Wahoo will continue to offer the Kickr Core with a choice of cassette with between eight and 12 speeds included, to suit your bike’s gearing. Its price is the same as the Kickr Core Zwift One and again includes a year’s Zwift subscription.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can additionally purchase the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/zwift-play-controllers\" target=\"_blank\">Zwift Play</a> controllers, which mount on either side of your handlebars and add virtual shifting, steering and braking to your trainer. It’s priced at £99 / $99 / €99 and can be used by owners of the current Kickr Core trainer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can read our full review of the outgoing <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/zwift-hub-one-review\" target=\"_blank\">Zwift Hub One </a>here.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/wahoo-kickr-core-zwift-one\">Wahoo and Zwift merge turbo trainers to launch the Kickr Core Zwift One</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"00f6b70173337b0decaa4763cb65dc9714325797652b3984edf9d9c30fd33186","category":"Cycling"}
