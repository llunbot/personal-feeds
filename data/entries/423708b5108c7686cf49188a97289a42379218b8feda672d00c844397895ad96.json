A new Capture Button is also rumored to be included, allowing for dedicated photo and video controls, with gestures such as swiping to zoom or using a soft press for focus.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max will reportedly introduce larger displays, increasing from 6.1- to 6.3-inches and 6.7- to 6.9-inches, while incorporating slimmer bezels for a sleeker design.
