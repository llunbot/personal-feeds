However, Nappi said that date is conditional on availability of an Atlas V rocket, provided by United Launch Alliance, and an opening in NASA's visiting vehicles schedule.</p>\n<p>According to NASA's internal schedule, there is a docking port available from early April to late June 2024 on the International Space Station. So barring a schedule change to delay a cargo mission, the likely no-earlier-than launch date for Starliner's crewed test flight is April 2024.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959382#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959382&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c86c773b1744d97e011c022a32c53ca212441729ce271d620f46b8f841ad8386","category":"Tech"}
