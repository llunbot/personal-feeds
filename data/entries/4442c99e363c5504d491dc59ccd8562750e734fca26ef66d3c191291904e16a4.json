Right now, “Zero Trust” is in serious danger of becoming an empty buzzword. The problem isn’t just that marketers have slapped the Zero Trust label on everything short of breakfast cereal — it’s that for all the hype, <a href=\"https://www.cshub.com/attacks/articles/the-biggest-data-breaches-and-leaks-of-2022\">we don’t seem to be getting any safer</a>.</p>\n\n<p>At the heart of Zero Trust is a good idea, but the way most companies execute that idea is <em>incomplete</em>. Specifically, most security practitioners forget that device compliance is a crucial element of Zero Trust. Kolide solves the device compliance element of Zero Trust for companies that use Okta. Kolide’s premise is simple: if an employee’s device is out of compliance, they can’t log in to their cloud apps until they’ve fixed the problem. And instead of creating more work for IT, Kolide provides instructions so users can get unblocked on their own.</p>\n\n<p>Kolide works across your Mac, Windows, and even Linux devices, with mobile support coming soon.
