Stubbies feature a short inseam, are made from thick canvas, are durable, have extra leg room for added mobility, and are no-nonsense “workwear.”</p>\n<p>Matt from Crust is an Aussie, and he was bummed not to be able to find stubbies anywhere in the States, so Cheech took on the challenge and released some Casa Verde shorts for Crust Bikes. The Southern-Hemi shorts are made in the USA from 10 oz US-milled canvas and triple stitched throughout. Some clever details that set these canvas shorts apart are the Antimicrobial Spandex panels sewn in high-sweat areas.</p>\n<p><strong>They run a size larger than your standard shorts</strong>. For instance, I wear a 34 in just about everything, but the 32 fits me great. They also have a slightly larger, roomier leg opening for those of you who like to wear bibs or a chamois under your shorts.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/Josh-Santa-Fe-June-2024-102.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/Josh-Santa-Fe-June-2024-102.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/Josh-Santa-Fe-June-2024-102.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/Josh-Santa-Fe-June-2024-102.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/Josh-Santa-Fe-June-2024-102.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3RnKjTY\" target=\"_blank\">The New HydraPak Filter</a> $35</h3>\n<p>When it comes to my riding kit, I like to evolve it when possible, and the two key “<a href=\"https://theradavist.com/every-ride-carry-for-mtb-and-gravel/\" target=\"_blank\">every ride carry</a>” items I’m highlighting this year are all about weight and size savings.

Whatever the wizards at Lezyne have done with these new mini pumps, kudos! I don’t wanna know the mountain magick that went into the design. It weighs a scant 104 grams and is only 6″ long in total (the CNC aluminum shaft is only 5″ long.)

Glow Stick Sunblock</a> $30</h3>\n<p>When it comes to sun and UV protection up here at 7,000′ in Santa Fe, I have to take it very seriously, especially after my bout with skin cancer a few years ago. Getting a new 3″ long scar on your face puts your already serious sun protection regimen into overdrive. I have used various Australian brands like Blue Iguana over the years, but the white, chalky mineral base got all over everything (and into my eyes).</p>\n<p>Someone recommended Supergoop Glow Stick, and I’ve worn it ever since. It stays on for a 2-hour ride, and for anything longer, I just re-apply. It’s small, fits in a small <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/revelate-designs-nook-frame-bag-review/\" target=\"_blank\">frame bag like the Revelate Nook</a>, or a hip bag, and no matter how sweaty you get, it keeps bouncing back those UV rays.</p>\n<p><em>If you like to swim in salt or freshwater, use the <a href=\"https://supergoop.com/collections/mineral\" target=\"_blank\">Supergoop Mineral</a>…</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/SummerPicks2024-11.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/SummerPicks2024-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/SummerPicks2024-11.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/SummerPicks2024-11.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/SummerPicks2024-11.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/SummerPicks2024-13.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/SummerPicks2024-13.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/SummerPicks2024-13.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/SummerPicks2024-13.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/SummerPicks2024-13.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/SummerPicks2024-14.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/SummerPicks2024-14.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/SummerPicks2024-14.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/SummerPicks2024-14.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/SummerPicks2024-14.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=9c3967ea-9801-442a-9d09-419007ae71c3&amp;website_id=6ec3743b-a948-4c16-9d12-4b79ac107f25&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsilca.cc%2Fcollections%2Fchain-lube-wax%2Fproducts%2Fchain-waxing-system\" target=\"_blank\">Silca Chain Waxing System</a> $99</h3>\n<p>Ok, ok. I know this is in vogue right now, but <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/silca-chain-waxing-system-review/\" target=\"_blank\">after reading Morgan’s review of Silca’s Chain Waxing System</a>, I gave it a try. Our trails have been very dry and dusty this year and I just put a brand new drivetrain on my beloved Murmur, so it was an opportune time to give waxing a go. I spent an hour-ish from start to finish and felt a noticeable difference immediately on the first ride. I have maybe 100 miles on this chain right now and can feel the efficiency, particularly when in cross-chained climbs in the 28-tooth chainring and 52-tooth cassette.</p>\n<p><em>I don’t want to sound like an infomercial here, but man, it really does make a difference. Plus, it’s cathartic to spend some TLC on a favorite bike to ensure it pedals smoothly through the summer months.</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024Chama-28.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024Chama-28.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024Chama-28.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024Chama-28.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/2024Chama-28.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://bedrocksandals.com/collections/cairn-evo-pro-lineup/products/cairn-evo-3d-pro\" target=\"_blank\">Bedrock Cairn Evo 3D PRO Sandals</a> $140</h3>\n<p>I’ve been wearing Bedrock Sandals since the Cairn sandals launched in 2016. The Cairn Evo 3D sandals have taken me throughout the Sierra of California, Canyon Country, bike tours in Montana, and even some singletrack riding here in Santa Fe. They truly are the best “shoe replacement” for those hot summer months.

The thermoregulation is superb! Plus they pack down to nothing.

In my opinion, I feel like the more we dress like “everyday people” on bikes, the more human we appear to motorists, and the more likely people will be drawn to riding bikes.</p>\n<p><em>I will say that I upgraded the soles to <a href=\"https://www.protalus.com/collections/shop\" target=\"_blank\">Protalus insoles</a> for more arch support…</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/RadavistSpring24-6.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/RadavistSpring24-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/RadavistSpring24-6.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/RadavistSpring24-6.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/RadavistSpring24-6.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/Rocky-Mountain-Instinct-Review-29.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/Rocky-Mountain-Instinct-Review-29.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/Rocky-Mountain-Instinct-Review-29.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/Rocky-Mountain-Instinct-Review-29.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/Rocky-Mountain-Instinct-Review-29.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://backcountry.tnu8.net/xkYMEv\" target=\"_blank\">Smith Payroll Helmet in Matte Dusk</a> $200</h3>\n<p>It’s pink, it’s comfy, it’s lightweight, and it has great ventilation, but the reason I love this helmet is the smiles it brings people seeing a pink helmet.

While we know our favorite bird calls – for me, it’s the Canyon Wren and Spotted Towhee – sometimes, a call throws us off.</p>\n<p>Merlin identifies birds by their calls and allows you to catalog your sightings.

My fitness has peaked, my emotions are more stable, and I wake up feeling fresh and ready to take on the day’s tasks.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, psychedelics like psilocybin, LSD, and DMT helped me figure out who I am as a person and my place in this world. But without weekly therapy, I wouldn’t have been able to process lifelong trauma. And I wholeheartedly need to emphasize that. Drugs don’t “fix” your issues; only therapy will do that.</p>\n<p><em>I often use a car bodywork analogy that drugs (even endorphins, I might add!) simply act like bondo over rusty metal. You’ve got to cut the rust out first through therapy, or it’ll simply spread under the bondo and fresh paint.</em></p>\n<p>Seriously.
