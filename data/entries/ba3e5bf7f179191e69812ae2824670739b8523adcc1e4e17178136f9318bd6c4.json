{"title":"How to share raw and HEIC photos from your iPhone","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2004019/how-to-share-raw-heic-files-from-iphone.html","date":1692867600000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since Apple added a “raw” mode to iPhone and iPad camera shots, the pathway diverged for how to send the highest-resolution format of a file to other people. “Raw” (sometimes capitalized as RAW, even though it’s not an acronym) incorporates less-processed color and image data that allows better post-capture tuning–and even higher-resolution photographs, as with the iPhone 14 Pro camera system. Any iPhone 14 Pro model can capture 48 megapixels (MP) in raw mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, when you try to transfer raw images or even regularly processed images stored locally in the HEIC format, you can wind up unable to send someone a file that contains the full information load. In the interests of ensuring a compatible or smaller file, iOS and iPadOS convert a raw file to HEIC or JPEG or a HEIC file to JPEG. (Even with Settings &gt; Photos &gt; Transfer to Mac or PC set to Keep Originals enabled.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, on the road, I attempted to transfer a raw image file from my iPhone to a colleague when he wasn’t nearby, and I didn’t have my Mac handy. Sharing from Photos via Messages or email always results in a downsampled image, as does saving to iCloud Drive and then sharing a link via Share &gt; Send Copy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, you can try one of the following in Photos in iOS or iPadOS after tapping the Share icon:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>AirDrop</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Copy iCloud Link</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Save to Files, then switch to the Files app, tap the image, choose <em>Share</em>, choose <em>Collaborate</em>, then choose the method to send, like Messages or email.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Save to Dropbox</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have access to your Mac, you can export the image directly via <em>File &gt; Export &gt; Export Unmodified Original for 1 Photo</em>, preserving the original format, and then send that via a variety of ways—but not via Messages! Messages will quietly downsize it while retaining the raw format. In a test, a 68.6MB raw image was downsampled to 2.5MB without warning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Marcin.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
