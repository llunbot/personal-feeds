Well, dream no more with this massive <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-300W-000mAh-Power-Bank/dp/B0CJY37RT3\">Ugreen 48,000mAh power bank for $110 at Amazon</a>, a ridiculous 45 percent discount on its MSRP, and the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ugreen Nexode 48KmAh power bank is an absolute beast that delivers up to 300W in total through its five ports. That’s enough to charge phones, tablets, and even Apple’s 16-inch MacBook Pro. Despite its massive capacity, if you have a 140W wall charger, you’ll be able to fully recharge it in just 1.5 hours, which is amazing for a power bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At just 4 pounds, it’s pretty much perfect for camping, office situations where outlets are scarce, traveling, park dates, and more. Just imagine taking this one with you when you go to the woods to capture amazing scenes with your drone and being able to recharge it every time the battery runs out quickly—and we all know those deplete fast. And what’s more, there’s a built-in light you can use at night. You can adjust the light intensity and even choose the SOS mode if you get in trouble.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2400789/ugreen-48000mah-300w-portable-power-bank-review.html\">loved this power bank when we reviewed it</a>, giving it 4 stars and our editor’s choice rating.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many scenarios where this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-300W-000mAh-Power-Bank/dp/B0CJY37RT3\">Ugreen Nexode 48,000mAh power bank</a> can come in handy wherever and whenever you plan to travel.
