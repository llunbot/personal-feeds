Hopefully! While you’d likely look at this bike and call it a dirt jumper, Rocky Mountain Bikes is referring to their 2024 Flow as a ‘pump track bike’, given the rising popularity of pump tracks around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pump tracks are a great way to build essential riding skills while having tons of fun. With riders of all ages in mind, Rocky Mountain has released 20”, 24” and 26” wheeled models of the Flow.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-air.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-air.jpg\" alt=\"RMB Flow, Alex Volokhov, air\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-air.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-air-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-air-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-air-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-air-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-air-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Flow frames are made from 6061 alloy. While RMB doesn’t even mention dirt jumping in their press release, they do tout the Flow’s ‘sturdy construction’ so the bike should be tough enough for sending it at the jumps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up front, you’ll find a 100mm Manitou Circus Expert fork on the 26” model, and 80mm Suntour air-sprung forks on the 24” and 20” bikes. All frames use a threaded BB shell, have 135mm rear axle spacing and feature tapered zero-stack headtubes.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-Geo-chart.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"709\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-Geo-chart.jpg\" alt=\"RMB Flow geometry chart, all sizes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-Geo-chart.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-Geo-chart-297x175.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-Geo-chart-800x473.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-Geo-chart-120x71.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-Geo-chart-768x454.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As the chart above shows, the adult-sized 26” Flow comes in two frame sizes – SM/MD and LG/XL. There is a 40mm difference in reach and wheelbase between the two, but most other figures are the same. You may notice the longer frame offers a lower standover height, as the stack heights were kept equal between the two sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All sizes of the Flow run a 68.5° head tube. Seat mast angles are 76° (26”) or 75° (24” and 20”).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Build Highlights:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-Vaea.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-Vaea.jpg\" alt=\"RMB-Flow-Vaea\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-Vaea.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-Vaea-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-Vaea-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-Vaea-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-Vaea-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RMB-Flow-Vaea-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>“ As a mountain bike rider who is constantly looking to better myself on all bike platforms, the Flow has been the ultimate tool to sharpen some of the most fundamental skills, as well as a perfectly nimble weapon to start learning new tricks to take to the big bikes later on. It’s been the most significant tool for myself and sky is the limit on them!”<br /> <br /><strong>– Vaea Verbeeck, Athlete</strong></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Full spec charts for all models of the Flow are below, but here are a few notable highlights for each. Check out the different handlebar and crank sizes – It’s clear RMB intends to provide an appropriate fit for smaller riders. Pedals are not included on any models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 26” Flow gets a 780mm wide Rocky Mountain AM handlebar and 170mm 2-piece RMB Microdrive cranks with a 30t front chainring. With the Manitou fork, this model runs a 20x110mm front thru-axle and sealed bearings in the front and rear hubs. It also features a sealed BB, tubeless wheels, and Maxxis DTH 2.3” tires. The adult-sized Flow comes with a BMX-influenced ‘pivotal’ style seat and seatpost and accepts a 30.9mm post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Flow 24 features a Rocky Mountain Junior handlebar with a 19mm diameter and 640mm width.  RMB supplies their Microdrive cranks with 140mm arms and a 28t chainring. The Flow 24 also runs a Tektro rear mechanical disc brake, a sealed BB and rear hub, tubeless wheels, and Kenda K-Rad 2.3” tires. This model does get the pivotal seat and seatpost, but with a 27.2mm diameter post. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last up the Flow 20 comes equipped with a 600mm wide, 19mm diameter Rocky Mountain Junior handlebar, and 127mm RMB Microdrive cranks with a 28t chainring. It shares the 24” model’s 27.2mm pivotal seat and seatpost, Tektro rear mechanical disc brake, and sealed BB and rear hub. The wheels are a bit different, rolling on narrower Kenda K-Rad 2.125” tires and coming tubeless compatible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Model Lineup:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rocky Mountain Flow:
