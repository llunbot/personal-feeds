Microsoft is making allowances for you in a new Windows Insider Preview build in the Dev channel, which will <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/10/04/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26120-1930-dev-channel/\">allow the Copilot key to be reprogrammed</a> so that it can launch more than just Copilot.</p>\n<figure>\n    <div>\n                        <img width=\"2542\" height=\"1762\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/copilot-key-settings.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/copilot-key-settings.jpg 2542w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/copilot-key-settings-300x208.jpg 300w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/copilot-key-settings-640x444.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/copilot-key-settings-768x532.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/copilot-key-settings-1536x1065.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/copilot-key-settings-2048x1420.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/copilot-key-settings-980x679.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/copilot-key-settings-1440x998.jpg 1440w\" />\n                  </div>\n      </figure>\n\n<p>There are restrictions. To appear in the menu of options in the Settings app, Microsoft says an app must be \"MSIX packaged and signed, thus indicating the app meets security and privacy requirements to keep customers safe.\" Generally an app installed via the Microsoft Store or apps built into Windows will meet those requirements, though apps installed from other sources may not. But you can't make the Copilot key launch any old executable or batch file, and you can't customize it to do anything other than launch apps (at least, not without using third-party tools for reconfiguring your keyboard).</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/new-windows-11-build-lets-you-use-copilot-key-to-launch-things-that-arent-copilot/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/new-windows-11-build-lets-you-use-copilot-key-to-launch-things-that-arent-copilot/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2d932d51a451f5945635c551cd7feaba6feed71c88737014ce74f7f17784e891","category":"Tech"}
