But Fischer became a recluse; Musk is one of the most prominent people in the world.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/17/musk-faber-cnbc-interview\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"be7334fb7cf26112e71c276f5be5e92b4a30d76e8cb72d0eb3c542662ca82a16","category":"Tech"}
