When I sat down twelve months ago to shake out that year’s best, I couldn’t imagine that 2021 would be even stranger. But I adapted and still managed to squeeze in new bike product tests. Once again, this year I traveled abroad much less than during the before times, but I made the best of the times we could go, and more often traveled by road instead of air.</p><p>I was even locked down in my home city for a month and a half.&nbsp;But an active imagination can get us through difficult times.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/10143649/2021-Editors-Choice_Cory-circuit-of-Prague-in-lockdown.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/10143649/2021-Editors-Choice_Cory-circuit-of-Prague-in-lockdown.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Editor's Choice: Prague lockdown circumnavigation circuit\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/10143649/2021-Editors-Choice_Cory-circuit-of-Prague-in-lockdown.jpg 1500w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/10143649/2021-Editors-Choice_Cory-circuit-of-Prague-in-lockdown-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/10143649/2021-Editors-Choice_Cory-circuit-of-Prague-in-lockdown-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/10143649/2021-Editors-Choice_Cory-circuit-of-Prague-in-lockdown-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/10143649/2021-Editors-Choice_Cory-circuit-of-Prague-in-lockdown-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></a></p><p>So I hunted down over a hundred kilometers of tracks close to home that I’d never ridden. I discovered the 4 poles of Prague. I pushed a new e-gravel bike to its absolute limits circumnavigating the city limits. I rode bikes more in winter snow than ever before (<em>the ski lifts remained closed!</em>) I logged another <del><em>difficult</em></del> <em>excellent</em> 200+km gravel solstice ride with close friends. And explored half a dozen MTB trail areas just across the Polish border that I’d never gotten around to.</p><p>See, from chaos came opportunity. And I got to spend almost all of my time riding off-road. Bonus!</p><p>So sorry, my Best of the Road picks are slim this year. But it means that all my other 2021 Editor’s Choice Award picks are products I’ve spent a lot of time with. And they really are the best of the best.</p><p>But first I’ll start off with the three key experiences that kept me excited to throw a leg over a bike this year.</p><h3>ABOUT CORY</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172522/2021-Editors-Choice_Cory-in-the-snow.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172522/2021-Editors-Choice_Cory-in-the-snow.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Editor's Choice: about Cory, in the snow\" width=\"1525\" height=\"1600\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172522/2021-Editors-Choice_Cory-in-the-snow.jpg 1525w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172522/2021-Editors-Choice_Cory-in-the-snow-286x300.jpg 286w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172522/2021-Editors-Choice_Cory-in-the-snow-800x839.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172522/2021-Editors-Choice_Cory-in-the-snow-114x120.jpg 114w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172522/2021-Editors-Choice_Cory-in-the-snow-768x806.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172522/2021-Editors-Choice_Cory-in-the-snow-1464x1536.jpg 1464w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1525px) 100vw, 1525px\"></a></p><p>A quick refresher on me…</p><p>I’m most comfortable staying off-road. A technical trail rider at the core, I ride gravel bikes like they’re mountain bikes, and road bikes like they are… well, also like mountain bikes… just with skinnier, sketchier tires. This year I’ve been able to focus on the dirt. When you can’t go far from home, burning repetitive laps on a road bike was just going to get boring.</p><p>Maybe the biggest shift this year was more time spent riding the Czech borderlands, both on gravel bikes laden with gear to camp and pushing enduro bikes to their limits both up &amp; downhill. Plus, getting loose in the snow on that fat bike, and plenty of less appropriate bikes, too.</p><p>Last year I thought I’d ridden most of the Czech border bikeparks. Oh boy, was I wrong. I’d just ridden the bigger ones.</p><h2>Experience</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172839/2021-Editors-Choice-Cory_Family-Bikeparking-berm.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172839/2021-Editors-Choice-Cory_Family-Bikeparking-berm.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Editor's Choice: Family bikeparking, Dolni Morava berm\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172839/2021-Editors-Choice-Cory_Family-Bikeparking-berm.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172839/2021-Editors-Choice-Cory_Family-Bikeparking-berm-297x167.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172839/2021-Editors-Choice-Cory_Family-Bikeparking-berm-800x450.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172839/2021-Editors-Choice-Cory_Family-Bikeparking-berm-120x68.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172839/2021-Editors-Choice-Cory_Family-Bikeparking-berm-768x432.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172839/2021-Editors-Choice-Cory_Family-Bikeparking-berm-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE:</strong> <strong>Family bikeparking<br></strong>That bikepark revelation came when it was time to take the kids on vacation without venturing too far from home. With the kids, I think we rode four new parks I’d never tried, plus three more new singletrack trail centers.</p><p>Taking the whole family off on an adventure is always a great idea. But it’s always a bit tricky to satisfy everyone – a bike nerd (me), an enduro-y wife, a pre-teen girl who just wants to dial in her jumping &amp; wheelie skills while showing off to her mom that she can ride further no-handed, and a 7-year-old boy who isn’t very interested in trails that are ‘too bumpy’.</p><p>But that’s where a growing list of family-friendly bikeparks come in. You just need to make sure the kids have some good fitting protection: a full-face is best, plus good gloves &amp; knee pads at a minimum. We also love EVOC’s light, small kid-friendly <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/evoc-back-protection-levels-up-w-new-evoc-liteshield-plus-protector-for-mtb-snow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Protector Vest</a> back protectors for added security.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172535/2021-Editors-Choice-Cory_Family-Bikeparking-trips-to-the-bike-parkfinish-line.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172535/2021-Editors-Choice-Cory_Family-Bikeparking-trips-to-the-bike-parkfinish-line.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Editor's Choice: Family bikeparking, Dolni Morava finish line\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172535/2021-Editors-Choice-Cory_Family-Bikeparking-trips-to-the-bike-parkfinish-line.jpg 1800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172535/2021-Editors-Choice-Cory_Family-Bikeparking-trips-to-the-bike-parkfinish-line-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172535/2021-Editors-Choice-Cory_Family-Bikeparking-trips-to-the-bike-parkfinish-line-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172535/2021-Editors-Choice-Cory_Family-Bikeparking-trips-to-the-bike-parkfinish-line-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172535/2021-Editors-Choice-Cory_Family-Bikeparking-trips-to-the-bike-parkfinish-line-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09172535/2021-Editors-Choice-Cory_Family-Bikeparking-trips-to-the-bike-parkfinish-line-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\"></a></p><p>The best ones offer smooth berms that everyone loves – just go faster to make them more difficult – and rougher, more technical tracks for when the parents ride alone. We’ve found parks with plenty of attractions to keep kids of all ages busy when not riding (<em>E.g.</em> a trampoline cage &amp; a blue bouncy castle/slide in the background, <em>above</em>).</p><p>Younger kids (and kids of different ages) often don’t have the stamina for all-day rides climbing &amp; descending. So on top of regular trail riding at home, a trip to a bikepark means all the fun going downhill with less pain. And they get to build technical skills and confidence at the same time. We’ve even found that by mixing up more kids across all different ages, they tend to group together and help each other improve. Even the older kids seem to have fun teaching the smaller ones new tricks.</p><p>Plus, more adults to play tag-team parenting while the others ride.</p><p>You kinda can’t go wrong…</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Challenge-Getaway-40-gravel-tire_Lynskey-Pro-GR-gravel-bike-off-road-bikepacking-camp.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Challenge-Getaway-40-gravel-tire_Lynskey-Pro-GR-gravel-bike-off-road-bikepacking-camp.jpg\" alt=\"All-new 40mm Challenge Getaway handmade tubeless gravel tires, bikepacking camp\" width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Challenge-Getaway-40-gravel-tire_Lynskey-Pro-GR-gravel-bike-off-road-bikepacking-camp.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Challenge-Getaway-40-gravel-tire_Lynskey-Pro-GR-gravel-bike-off-road-bikepacking-camp-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Challenge-Getaway-40-gravel-tire_Lynskey-Pro-GR-gravel-bike-off-road-bikepacking-camp-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Challenge-Getaway-40-gravel-tire_Lynskey-Pro-GR-gravel-bike-off-road-bikepacking-camp-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Challenge-Getaway-40-gravel-tire_Lynskey-Pro-GR-gravel-bike-off-road-bikepacking-camp-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Challenge-Getaway-40-gravel-tire_Lynskey-Pro-GR-gravel-bike-off-road-bikepacking-camp-696x418.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Challenge-Getaway-40-gravel-tire_Lynskey-Pro-GR-gravel-bike-off-road-bikepacking-camp-1068x641.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Challenge-Getaway-40-gravel-tire_Lynskey-Pro-GR-gravel-bike-off-road-bikepacking-camp-700x420.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></a></p><p><strong>HONORABLE MENTION: A few days bikepacking<br></strong>While a lot of times, it may seem like bikepacking has to be some intense adventure, not everyone is cut out for riding for two weeks straight in the mountains of Kyrgyzstan or trying to cross an entire continent in one go.

On an enduro bike that can mean a lot of pedaling up.</p><p>So why not search out a mountain bike shuttle service near you and combine the benefits of lift-served trails AND natural terrain. You likely are still going to have to pedal quite a bit – this is enduro after all, not DH – but a shuttle service might just show you some new trails, too.</p><p>My first new local shuttle service od 2021 started just across the CZ border in the village of Piechowice, PL. There, the <a href=\"http://www.izerskycollective.pl/\">Izersky Collective</a> loaded us up in a van and hauled us around all day to sample some of the steepest most technical trails in the border mountains. We still had to climb quite a bit over the passes, as the shuttle stuck to the asphalt – oof! But we were able to squeeze in almost 3000m of descending some of the steepest, most technical terrain I’ve ridden all year –&nbsp; all in the waning daylight of a mid-autumn day.</p><p>We’re looking forward to more riding in the Jizerka Mountains next year.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154647/Editors-Choice-Awards_Corys-fav-MTB-shuttles_Trasy-Enduro-Srebrna-Gora.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154647/Editors-Choice-Awards_Corys-fav-MTB-shuttles_Trasy-Enduro-Srebrna-Gora.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Honorable Mention: Local MTB Shuttle - Trasy Enduro Srebrna Gora, PL \" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154647/Editors-Choice-Awards_Corys-fav-MTB-shuttles_Trasy-Enduro-Srebrna-Gora.jpg 1800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154647/Editors-Choice-Awards_Corys-fav-MTB-shuttles_Trasy-Enduro-Srebrna-Gora-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154647/Editors-Choice-Awards_Corys-fav-MTB-shuttles_Trasy-Enduro-Srebrna-Gora-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154647/Editors-Choice-Awards_Corys-fav-MTB-shuttles_Trasy-Enduro-Srebrna-Gora-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154647/Editors-Choice-Awards_Corys-fav-MTB-shuttles_Trasy-Enduro-Srebrna-Gora-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154647/Editors-Choice-Awards_Corys-fav-MTB-shuttles_Trasy-Enduro-Srebrna-Gora-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\"></a></p><p>Our second new-to-us local mountain bike shuttle service this year is actually quite a bit older.</p><p><a href=\"https://pmbike-experts.pl/trasy-mtb/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trasy Enduro Srebrna Gora</a> have been running truck &amp; vans up the mountain gravel roads laden down with enduro riders for years.

Long enough travel to even bleed into enduro and happy to spend time in the occasional bikepark. Plus, it’s an efficient climber and light enough to be your everyday trail bike.</p><p>This summer they added a first mixed wheelsize Mullet version of the Spectral, and it ticks every box you’d want out of a playful big trail / light enduro bike. With the 29er wheel and 160mm of travel up front to a 27.5 wheel and 150mm travel in the back, the carbon <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-canyon-spectral-mullet-cf-cllctv-shifts-capable-trail-bike-to-enduro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spectral Mullet CF CLLCTV</a> shifts the already capable trail bike towards enduro. I was surprised to learn after riding the bike for two weeks that it was the same travel &amp; same geometry as the 29er, because it really felt more cable thrashing technical trails.</p><p>The only downside is that Canyon only makes one Mullet CLLCTV build of the Spectral with a coil shock, and only with a carbon frame. But after adding almost identical alloy bikes in 27.5 &amp; 29″ wheels this summer, I bet more mullets are to come.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09081841/2022-Scott-Spark-900-XC-trail-mountain-bike_light-fully-integrated-cross-country-MTB_900-Tuned-AXS-complete-mtn.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09081841/2022-Scott-Spark-900-XC-trail-mountain-bike_light-fully-integrated-cross-country-MTB_900-Tuned-AXS-complete-mtn.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Honorable Mention MTB: Scott Spark 900 Tuned\" width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09081841/2022-Scott-Spark-900-XC-trail-mountain-bike_light-fully-integrated-cross-country-MTB_900-Tuned-AXS-complete-mtn.jpg 1500w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09081841/2022-Scott-Spark-900-XC-trail-mountain-bike_light-fully-integrated-cross-country-MTB_900-Tuned-AXS-complete-mtn-297x178.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09081841/2022-Scott-Spark-900-XC-trail-mountain-bike_light-fully-integrated-cross-country-MTB_900-Tuned-AXS-complete-mtn-800x480.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09081841/2022-Scott-Spark-900-XC-trail-mountain-bike_light-fully-integrated-cross-country-MTB_900-Tuned-AXS-complete-mtn-120x72.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09081841/2022-Scott-Spark-900-XC-trail-mountain-bike_light-fully-integrated-cross-country-MTB_900-Tuned-AXS-complete-mtn-768x461.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09081841/2022-Scott-Spark-900-XC-trail-mountain-bike_light-fully-integrated-cross-country-MTB_900-Tuned-AXS-complete-mtn-696x418.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09081841/2022-Scott-Spark-900-XC-trail-mountain-bike_light-fully-integrated-cross-country-MTB_900-Tuned-AXS-complete-mtn-1068x641.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09081841/2022-Scott-Spark-900-XC-trail-mountain-bike_light-fully-integrated-cross-country-MTB_900-Tuned-AXS-complete-mtn-700x420.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></a></p><p><strong>HONORABLE MENTION: Scott Spark 900 Tuned<br></strong>This summer Scott gave their Spark XC bike a Bold hidden shock redesign, stepping up the World Cup cross-country race bike’s travel to 120mm as a slacker, faster, fully-integrated XC bike. But while Nino &amp; Kate race 120mm bikes with 120mm forks, the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2022-scott-spark-gets-bold-new-redesign-as-a-slack-fast-fully-integrated-120mm-xc-bike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spark 900s</a>&nbsp; get slightly more fork travel, a bit slacker geometry &amp; larger air volume shocks.</p><p>And the thing is, this 120/130mm version climbs just as well as the World Cup bike, but descends like an animal. Part of the secret is that Scott’s great (triple) TwinLoc remote on all the bikes, giving you three suspension positions: open descending, slightly reduced travel traction control &amp; full lockout mode&nbsp;(it also adds a dropper remote in one place, too.) Drop it into Traction Control, and it feels like you are pedaling a lightweight 80mm travel XC race rocket up the hills.</p><p>And you could just pop a travel-reducing spacer in the fork to mimic Nino Schurter’s World Championship winning setup. Don’t let anyone tell you 120mm is too much travel for an XC bike, just ask Nino.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154620/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Duratec-Fat-Jack-fatbike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154620/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Duratec-Fat-Jack-fatbike.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Honorable Mention: Duratec Fat Jack\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154620/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Duratec-Fat-Jack-fatbike.jpg 2000w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154620/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Duratec-Fat-Jack-fatbike-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154620/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Duratec-Fat-Jack-fatbike-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154620/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Duratec-Fat-Jack-fatbike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154620/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Duratec-Fat-Jack-fatbike-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154620/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Duratec-Fat-Jack-fatbike-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE – fat: Duratec Fat Jack</strong><br>Snow’s on the ground again, but this past winter we spent a good time riding Czech aluminum bike maker Duratec’s fat bikes before our hard lockdown.

Duratec builds every bike to order in Europe, so you can tailor the braze-ons to what you plan to carry, paint it any color you want, even set it up to run two rear wheels for the ultimate adventure-proof setup.</p><p>It doesn’t hurt that the bike was developed together with <a href=\"http://www.jankopka.cz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jan Kopka</a> who won the Iditabike on one of the bike’s earliest generations.

All that and this new made-in-Italy gravel bike feels faster and more controlled when descending over any surface, and it still climbs like a proper road bike.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01140239/Ortlieb-Handlebar-Pack-QR-waterproof-quick-release-bikepacking-bag_Rondo-Ruut-2x-complete-muddy.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01140239/Ortlieb-Handlebar-Pack-QR-waterproof-quick-release-bikepacking-bag_Rondo-Ruut-2x-complete-muddy.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Honorable Mention Gravel Bike: Rondo Ruut 2x\" width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01140239/Ortlieb-Handlebar-Pack-QR-waterproof-quick-release-bikepacking-bag_Rondo-Ruut-2x-complete-muddy.jpg 1500w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01140239/Ortlieb-Handlebar-Pack-QR-waterproof-quick-release-bikepacking-bag_Rondo-Ruut-2x-complete-muddy-297x178.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01140239/Ortlieb-Handlebar-Pack-QR-waterproof-quick-release-bikepacking-bag_Rondo-Ruut-2x-complete-muddy-800x480.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01140239/Ortlieb-Handlebar-Pack-QR-waterproof-quick-release-bikepacking-bag_Rondo-Ruut-2x-complete-muddy-120x72.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01140239/Ortlieb-Handlebar-Pack-QR-waterproof-quick-release-bikepacking-bag_Rondo-Ruut-2x-complete-muddy-768x461.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01140239/Ortlieb-Handlebar-Pack-QR-waterproof-quick-release-bikepacking-bag_Rondo-Ruut-2x-complete-muddy-696x418.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01140239/Ortlieb-Handlebar-Pack-QR-waterproof-quick-release-bikepacking-bag_Rondo-Ruut-2x-complete-muddy-1068x641.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01140239/Ortlieb-Handlebar-Pack-QR-waterproof-quick-release-bikepacking-bag_Rondo-Ruut-2x-complete-muddy-700x420.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></a></p><p><strong>HONORABLE MENTION: Rondo Ruut 2x</strong><br>Rondo gave their adjustable geo, carbon <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021-rondo-ruut-2x-takes-cf2-carbon-al1-alloy-gravel-bikes-further-with-grx-doubles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ruut gravel bike</a> the 2x treatment this year with GRX, and I’ve been riding it over hill and dale since the spring. I’ve covered more kilometers on this bike than anything else this year, it’s the only bike I’ve ridden over 200km in one go this year, and on sweltering solstice gravel to boot. And the only reason that I give it an Honorable Mention instead of an Editor’s Choice is that it is essentially the same reasonably-priced carbon gravel bike that was launched all the way back in 2017, and got a fork upgrade in 2020.</p><p>But even the simple act of adding a front derailleur makes this a more versatile bike for everything from all-road to full gravel bikepacking adventure. I personally prefer the tighter gear spacing and wide range of a compact road 2x across more varied riding. Swap between a road wheelset and the higher axle position vs. a gravel wheelset with the fork in the lower axle position, and you get the best out of this original do-it-all dropbar shapeshifter.</p><h2>Road Bikes</h2><div id=\"attachment_273299\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/30191810/Fara-F-RD-aero-carbon-endurance-adventure-all-road-bike_rendering.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-273299\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/30191810/Fara-F-RD-aero-carbon-endurance-adventure-all-road-bike_rendering.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Best Road Bike: Fara F/RD\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/30191810/Fara-F-RD-aero-carbon-endurance-adventure-all-road-bike_rendering.jpg 2000w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/30191810/Fara-F-RD-aero-carbon-endurance-adventure-all-road-bike_rendering-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/30191810/Fara-F-RD-aero-carbon-endurance-adventure-all-road-bike_rendering-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/30191810/Fara-F-RD-aero-carbon-endurance-adventure-all-road-bike_rendering-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/30191810/Fara-F-RD-aero-carbon-endurance-adventure-all-road-bike_rendering-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/30191810/Fara-F-RD-aero-carbon-endurance-adventure-all-road-bike_rendering-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-273299\"><em>c.

The thing is, you ride a gravel bike above the EU 25km/hr pedal-assist cot off so much, an e-gravel bike only really offers support on moderate to steeper climbs.</p><p>That means ebikemotion’s X35 hub motor paired to a 250Wh internal battery is supposed to offer around 80km of pedal-assist. But I wanted to push it further, so by adding 208Wh of extra juice in the 1.7kg Xtra Power external battery I figured I could get that up to 145km. But riding a bit faster, I realized I could get even more. In the end, I pushed the 250+208Wh setup for 166km of gravel in less than 6.5hours.</p><p>The Xtra Power external battery greatly extends the range of the e-bike. Especially since pedal-assist power starts to significantly taper off once the built-in battery drops below a quarter charge, the external battery significantly delays that power reduction.

The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/found-classified-wireless-internal-gear-hub-shifts-2x-range-on-your-1x-gravel-bike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Classified Powershift</a> tucks a wireless-shifting 2-speed planetary gear system inside the rear hub. Compatible with Shimano 11 speed and SRAM 12sp drivetrains, the Classified setup delivers all of the aero, straight chainline benefits of a 1x setup with the wide range and small gearing steps of a traditional road 2x drivetrain, plus it shifts lightning fast and even under full load. Good luck getting a front derailleur to do that. You can retrofit it to pretty much any 12mm thru-axle road or gravel bike. Plus, it seems like every month we hear about another bike company that has made Classified Powershift a stock OEM build option, too.</p><p>2x is dead, long live 2x.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/25060943/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-Mullet_low-cost-1x12-speed-wireless-electronic-MTB-derailleur-for-gravel-bike-build_detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/25060943/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-Mullet_low-cost-1x12-speed-wireless-electronic-MTB-derailleur-for-gravel-bike-build_detail.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Best Drivetrain: SRAM GX AXS Eagle Mullet\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/25060943/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-Mullet_low-cost-1x12-speed-wireless-electronic-MTB-derailleur-for-gravel-bike-build_detail.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/25060943/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-Mullet_low-cost-1x12-speed-wireless-electronic-MTB-derailleur-for-gravel-bike-build_detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/25060943/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-Mullet_low-cost-1x12-speed-wireless-electronic-MTB-derailleur-for-gravel-bike-build_detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/25060943/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-Mullet_low-cost-1x12-speed-wireless-electronic-MTB-derailleur-for-gravel-bike-build_detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/25060943/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-Mullet_low-cost-1x12-speed-wireless-electronic-MTB-derailleur-for-gravel-bike-build_detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/25060943/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-Mullet_low-cost-1x12-speed-wireless-electronic-MTB-derailleur-for-gravel-bike-build_detail-696x464.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/25060943/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-Mullet_low-cost-1x12-speed-wireless-electronic-MTB-derailleur-for-gravel-bike-build_detail-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/25060943/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-Mullet_low-cost-1x12-speed-wireless-electronic-MTB-derailleur-for-gravel-bike-build_detail-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p><strong>HONORABLE MENTION: </strong><strong>SRAM GX AXS Eagle<br></strong>For gravel or mountain bikes, it’s hard to argue with the setup simplicity of AXS. Plus, Blips are awesome for bikepacking &amp; adventure riding. When SRAM told us GX was getting AXS, I personally didn’t think it was going to be that big of a deal. I was wrong.<br>When it was ready and I got a set up for my do-it-all Bombtrack Audax gravel commuting bikepacking bike, I combined the new wireless <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-gx-eagle-axs-review-first-rides-drop-bar-builds-actual-weights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GX AXS</a> rear derailleur and a set of Force AXS levers, plus a pair of Blips wired in just next to the stem. And then I was in love with my new gravel mullet setup and its wide 44×10-52T gearing. Fast shifts, huge range, and the ability to shift while riding on the tops. I could even charge a spare battery off my dynamo front hub if I were to head out on a multi-week adventure. I’d probably even get some more Blips and stick ’em out on an aero bar for custom continent-crushing shifting ergonomics.</p><h2>Wheels &amp; Tires</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025249/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_trailside.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025249/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_trailside.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Best Road wheels: DT Swiss ERC 1100 45\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025249/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_trailside.jpg 2000w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025249/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_trailside-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025249/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_trailside-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025249/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_trailside-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025249/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_trailside-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025249/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_trailside-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE – Road wheels: DT Swiss ERC 1100 45<br></strong>The all-new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-rides-dt-swiss-erc-1100-45-aero-endurance-wheels-are-even-better-all-rounders-now/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DT Swiss ERC</a> endurance road wheels are literally better than ever: +15% wider, -4% lighter, more aero, and even cheaper (in Europe).

On top of the original fast-rolling <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-tufo-gravel-thundero-tires-roll-fast-deliver-all-surface-grip-or-a-quicker-speedero/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">40mm Thundero &amp; Speedero</a> comes an all-new proper knobby Swampero inspired by Tufo’s long-running Cubus cyclocross mud tire tread profile. They’re still reasonably light, surprisingly supple for a vulcanized nylon construction that seals tubeless almost without need for sealant, and still cheap at just 40€ a pop.</p><p>Now all three variants come in both 700c x 40mm &amp; 36mm sizes, and both tan or black walls.&nbsp;Why make a smaller 36mm size when gravel is going bigger with 45mm tires on many adventure bikes? Cyclocross bikes. Tufo has deep roots in cross, and a 40mm tire won’t fit in many existing CX bikes. But a 36mm gravel tire will, bring more mixed-surface versatility to tons of old cyclocross bikes that might have been feeling a bit out of touch in recent years.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14150658/Challenge-Getaway-gravel-bike-tire_durable-handmade-tubeless-H-TLR_-and-tubular-H-TLTU_options-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14150658/Challenge-Getaway-gravel-bike-tire_durable-handmade-tubeless-H-TLR_-and-tubular-H-TLTU_options-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Best Cyclocross tires: Challenge handmade tubeless tubulars H-TLTU\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1536\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14150658/Challenge-Getaway-gravel-bike-tire_durable-handmade-tubeless-H-TLR_-and-tubular-H-TLTU_options-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14150658/Challenge-Getaway-gravel-bike-tire_durable-handmade-tubeless-H-TLR_-and-tubular-H-TLTU_options-297x178.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14150658/Challenge-Getaway-gravel-bike-tire_durable-handmade-tubeless-H-TLR_-and-tubular-H-TLTU_options-800x480.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14150658/Challenge-Getaway-gravel-bike-tire_durable-handmade-tubeless-H-TLR_-and-tubular-H-TLTU_options-120x72.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14150658/Challenge-Getaway-gravel-bike-tire_durable-handmade-tubeless-H-TLR_-and-tubular-H-TLTU_options-768x461.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14150658/Challenge-Getaway-gravel-bike-tire_durable-handmade-tubeless-H-TLR_-and-tubular-H-TLTU_options-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14150658/Challenge-Getaway-gravel-bike-tire_durable-handmade-tubeless-H-TLR_-and-tubular-H-TLTU_options-2048x1229.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE – Cyclocross tires: Challenge Tubeless Tubulars H-TLTU<br></strong>This summer Challenge greatly expanded their line-up of durable <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/challenge-getaway-gravel-tire-adds-sizes-cyclocross-road-get-handmade-tubeless-tires-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">handmade tubeless tubulars</a> (H-TLTU) to include several cyclocross and gravel treads, in multiple widths. Challenge specifically developed the unique tubeless tubulars for the rigors of gravel riding with tough sidewall &amp; tread puncture protection – said to be more durable than regular tubeless, they can also run sealant &amp; be fixed with tubeless plugs, plus the tubular rim bed design is less susceptible to damage from rock strikes at too low pressure.

And this one is so much better than anything I’ve ever swung at a bike in anger.</p><p>But it also costs $150.</p><h2>Gear &amp; Accessories</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154636/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Syncros-IS-Accessory-Mount.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154636/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Syncros-IS-Accessory-Mount.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Best Gear: Syncros IS Accessory Mount\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154636/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Syncros-IS-Accessory-Mount.jpg 1800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154636/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Syncros-IS-Accessory-Mount-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154636/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Syncros-IS-Accessory-Mount-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154636/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Syncros-IS-Accessory-Mount-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154636/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Syncros-IS-Accessory-Mount-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154636/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Syncros-IS-Accessory-Mount-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE: Syncros IS Accessory Mount</strong><br>This add-on cage strap could totally fall in under our small things below, but it’s so good it deserves its own gear award &amp; recommendation. At only 14€, the <a href=\"https://www.syncros.com/global/en/product/syncros-is-accessory-mount?article=2754820001222\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Syncros IS Accessory Mount</a> is literally just a reinforced nylon bracket that comes with a velcro strap to secure a tube, tool, or whatever.</p><p>But its secret is a customizable, cut-to-fit base with four mounting holes and a couple of zip tie guide channels. Use the two holes on the long tab and it fits under a bottle cage in that little triangular space under both your bottle cages (see it carrying a tube, tool &amp; tire levers in the muddy Rondo photo, <em>up in the gravel section</em>) with a zip-tie around the down tube for stability. One hole (at the top chopped off) and it replaces a bottle cage. The two holes under the strap attach it under many saddles. Or one hole is secure enough to mount under the top tube of an enduro bike.</p><p>It’s really hard to beat. I think I’m gonna order another two of ’em.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154628/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Camelbak-Stash-Belt-and-Flow-hip-pack.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154628/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Camelbak-Stash-Belt-and-Flow-hip-pack.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Best Gear: Camelbak Stassh Belt &amp; Flow hip pack\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154628/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Camelbak-Stash-Belt-and-Flow-hip-pack.jpg 1800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154628/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Camelbak-Stash-Belt-and-Flow-hip-pack-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154628/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Camelbak-Stash-Belt-and-Flow-hip-pack-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154628/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Camelbak-Stash-Belt-and-Flow-hip-pack-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154628/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Camelbak-Stash-Belt-and-Flow-hip-pack-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09154628/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Camelbak-Stash-Belt-and-Flow-hip-pack-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE – pack:</strong> <strong>Camelbak Stash (&amp; Ultra) Belt<br></strong>The Camelbak <a href=\"https://www.camelbak.com/more/sale/stash-belt/CB-2191.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stash Belt</a> (<em>left, above</em>) is new to us because technically it’s not supposed to be for cyclists, but rather for runners.

To be fair, it doesn’t need to be a yellow one. These are actually made for Pirelli by Tubolito, so if you prefer orange, be my guest. Interestingly, Pirelli &amp; Tubolito make slightly different sizes and thicknesses for their otherwise identical tubes, so pick the one that’s the best fit for you – and the color valve you like. My trail bikes always have a yellow tube strapped on with that great Syncros add-on mount (from <em>just above</em>).</p><h2>Clothing</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09141626/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Albion-Ultralightweight-Insulated-Jacket.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09141626/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Albion-Ultralightweight-Insulated-Jacket.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Best Cycling Jacket: Albion Ultralight Insulated Jacket\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09141626/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Albion-Ultralightweight-Insulated-Jacket.jpg 1800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09141626/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Albion-Ultralightweight-Insulated-Jacket-297x165.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09141626/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Albion-Ultralightweight-Insulated-Jacket-800x444.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09141626/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Albion-Ultralightweight-Insulated-Jacket-120x67.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09141626/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Albion-Ultralightweight-Insulated-Jacket-768x427.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09141626/Editors-Choice-Awards_Cory_Albion-Ultralightweight-Insulated-Jacket-1536x853.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE – jacket: Albion Ultralight Insulated Jacket<br></strong>This thing is a game-changer in packable warmth.

Congratulations if you made it this far.</p><p>Looking back on a crazy year, and as I’m just now recovered from my bout with COVID (oof… two shots and careful for two years, and a kid brings it home from school), I’m just reminded of how liberating it can be to ride bikes outside, sometimes solo, sometimes with just a small group of likeminded friends.</p><p>Riding has definitely kept me sane.</p><p>And kind of cooped up, semi-isolated at home with the family, we thought another year might cause more stress &amp; strife than it did. Instead, we spent more time together. We rode more as a family. The rides were generally shorter, but there were a lot of them. And we all got better at how we ride. Lots of wins there. Don’t get me wrong, we all LOVE getting away from each other too.</p><p>But looking forward, we have plans to build some new trails of our own. Plans for a new pumptrack after building a mini one last summer. And maybe we’ll get some home technique training setup as well.</p><p>There’s always new bikes and new bike tech coming. And we’re ready for it.</p><p>In the meantime, I wish you a happy holidays wherever you are, whoever you are with, and whatever you have cause to celebrate. Here’s to many great rides, and lots of great new bike stuff for you all in 2022!</p><p><em>Full disclosure: Each of these products has been chosen purely on their performance and/or technological merits for the reasons described above. Many more great products have passed through my hands this year. Under no circumstances were any of our selections paid for by their producers. Nor was any preference or favor given to brand or advertiser. My selections are mostly (but not exclusively) limited to products I’ve actually spent time riding/testing in person. So a brand’s willingness to invite Bikerumor to join a launch event, or to provide product samples can make it more likely that we will have considered their products, if only because we can share our real, firsthand experiences.</em></p></section></div>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"7b7c65284380046ede9f41d66bc7df146817a1b93986d627699fd861635a29ec","category":"Cycling"}
