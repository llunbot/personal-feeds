Cyclists, in general, are tricky to buy for, and mountain bikers can be downright impossible — especially for the winter months. That’s why we’re here to help you find the right gift in the proper price range.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Gifts for Mountain Bikers Under $30</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-25-dollars.jpg\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-25-dollars.jpg\" alt=\"Best Gifts for mountain bikers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-25-dollars.jpg 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-25-dollars-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-25-dollars-800x400.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-25-dollars-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-25-dollars-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-25-dollars-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-25-dollars-2048x1024.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you ride mountain bikes, chances are you’re riding tubeless (or will be soon if you’re a newbie). Pouring the sealant in from the bottle is good enough, but if you like to keep your garage and clothes free of sealant goop, the <strong>Stan’s NoTubes Injector</strong> ($10, available at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F842502%2Fstans-notubes-tire-sealant-injector-2-oz%3Fcolor%3DNONE\">REI</a> and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fstan-s-notubes-injector\">Competitive Cyclist</a>) is the way to go. It’s cheap, works like a charm, and will be a hit guaranteed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, these ingenious little <strong><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/lezyne-2022-eurobike-tubeless-tire-repair-airtag-trackers-new-pumps/\">Lezyne Tubeless Pro Plugs</a></strong> ($16.50 at Amazon) will permanently fix your damaged tires. Remember, tubeless plugs are a temporary trailside fix. These take more work back at home (and the process is a bit more messy), but their repairs will last the lifetime of your favorite (and expensive) mountain bike tires. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chains break. Shit happens. Instead of being stuck on the side of the singletrack with a mangled chain and no way to pedal home, every trial rider should carry a spare chain link. It’s cheap insurance, and we like to even just electrical tape one around a brake hose so it’s always ready. A rainbow <strong>SRAM Eagle PowerLock</strong> ($5 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10270&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evo.com%2Fchains%2Fsram-powerlock-12-speed-chain-link%23image%3D138961%2F878861%2Fsram-powerlock-12-speed-chain-link-.jpg\">Evo</a>) is probably the prettiest one out there, and thanks to 12sp Eagle MTB market domination it’s pretty universal. If your riding buddy rolls on the latest Japanese drivetrains, they do a <strong>Shimano 12-speed Quick Link</strong> ($14 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10270&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evo.com%2Fchains%2Fshimano-12-speed-chain-quick-link%23image%3D203782%2F880081%2Fshimano-12-speed-chain-quick-link-.jpg\">Evo</a>), too. This will require a little sneaky sleuthing to make sure you get the perfect one for your riding pals’ bikes. But they’ll be happy you did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping on the stocking stuffer trend, the latest <strong>Muc Off Punk Powder</strong> ($20, available at Muc Off) is a concentrated bike wash formula in a powder that you mix into your favorite spray bottle. It<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/muc-off-punk-powder/\"> has the same cleaning power as the original</a> Muc Off Bike Cleaner, just way more eco-friendly to ship and fun to activate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New grips are always a hit; it feels like getting a new bike without the cost. We’re gonna go back to a classic with this pick and the trusted comfy <strong><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/esi-grips-slide-on-three-new-extra-chunky-ribbed-silicone-grips-including-35mm-fattys/  https://bikerumor.com/custom-esi-grips-will-burn-an-impression-onto-your-bike-this-season/\">ESI Chunky</a></strong> silicone grips ($20 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fesi-grips-chunky-mountain-bike-grip\">REI</a>). They come in tons of different colors to get matchy-matchy with your buddy’s bike, a different thickness &amp; shape for small or large hands. And you can even still get them custom engraved from just $25 which is pretty awesome for a truly personalized gift. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Mountain Bike Gifts for Under $50</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-50-dollars-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-50-dollars-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Best Gifts for mountain bikers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-50-dollars-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-50-dollars-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-50-dollars-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-50-dollars-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-50-dollars-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-50-dollars-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-50-dollars-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-50-dollars-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Every mountain biker needs more gloves, whether they know it or not. We’re a big fan of <strong>Endura Hummvee</strong> <strong>gloves</strong> ($30-40). You can pick from the <strong><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/you-can-design-danny-macaskills-favorite-endura-hummvee-lite-gloves/\">Hummvee Lite</a></strong> ($30 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fendura-hummvee-lite-icon-glove\">Competitive Cyclist</a>) if you prefer the minimalist mesh back and ultra-thin palm. Or go <strong>Hummvee Plus II</strong> ($40 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fendura-hummvee-plus-ii-glove-mens\">Competitive Cyclist</a>) for a bit more finger protection and a little padding under the palm. Either way you go, these are great tactile gloves with grippy fingertips that have held up well under our abusive hands. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back to talking tubeless, everyone needs to refresh their sealant, at least once a year. But many mountain bikers forget, letting sealant dry out and lose its magic flat-fixing capabilities. <strong><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/121391/\">Stan’s No Tubes Race Sealant</a></strong> ($44 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fstan-s-notubes-race-sealant\">Competitive Cyclist</a>) is a benchmark for actual real-world tubeless repair performance. There are other good options. But every mountain biker would be happy to unwrap a quart of Stan’s. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Airing those tires back up, the <strong><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/lezyne-2022-eurobike-tubeless-tire-repair-airtag-trackers-new-pumps/\">Lezyne Pocket Drive Pro HV</a></strong> ($50 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Flezyne-pocket-drive-pro-hv-mini-pump-multicolor-1-mp-pkdrhvp-v104%2Fp1426658\">Performance Bike</a>) is one of the shortest mini-pumps that we’ve used that will still comfortably get you back rolling from flat to full pressure on high-volume mountain bike tires. It’s made well, feels good in your hand, and includes a short flexible hose so you won’t stress or snap valves from all that serious trailside pumping. And it’s small enough to fit in almost any bag, pocket, or a carrier mounted behind a bottle cage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cold feet suck, and for some reason, it always seems colder in the woods. The <strong>Rapha Deep Winter Sock</strong> ($37, available at <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18518&amp;awinaffid=723761&amp;campaign=&amp;clickref=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fshop%2Fdeep-winter-socks%2Fproduct%2FDWS02XXBPK&amp;platform=pl\">Rapha</a>) is still about the best winter sock we’ve ever tested. Superb warmth, stretch, and breathability, without having to resort to chemical heat packs. The tall length keeps them in place under tights, and merino wool keeps them smelling fresh all the while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riding far from the trailhead means being self-sufficient – able to fix whatever breaks down on the trail. Sure it’s been around since 2016, but the <strong><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/made-in-europe-unior-euro-multi-tools-now-shipping/\">Unior Euro17 multi-tool</a></strong> ($45 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079KGYBHG/?tag=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg-20\">Amazon</a>) the biggest of the entirely made-in-Europe multitools by Unior is still the one I reach for most often. I don’t need a new one, because mine will last forever. But some mountain biker you know probably needs a more reliable tool to drop in their pack for trailside repairs. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Gifts for Mountain Bikers Under $100</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-100-dollars-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-100-dollars-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Best Gifts for mountain bikers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-100-dollars-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-100-dollars-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-100-dollars-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-100-dollars-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-100-dollars-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-100-dollars-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-100-dollars-2048x1229.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re definitely tool nerds here, and the <strong><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fix-wheelie-wrench-x-dynaplug-multi-tool/\">Fix Wheelie Wrench X Dynaplug</a></strong> ($80 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084WYGVH4/?tag=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg-20\">Amazon</a>) multitool satisfies our everyday carry yearnings as well. This one bumps up to the next price category, because it is best paired with <strong>Fix’s All Out Belt</strong> ($35 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BH46M1B/?tag=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg-20\">Amazon</a>). For a hundred and fifteen bucks, you get a super capable mini multi-tool with a pre-loaded tubeless repair Dynaplug, AND it’s always with you tucked inside of your belt buckle. I mean come on, every time I snap this out to fix anything, the crowd goes wild! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All mountain bikers also need to be able to plug a tubeless puncture when out riding. And we love the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-muc-off-stealth-tubeless-puncture-plugs-are-silent-and-sufficient/\"><strong>Muc-Off Stealth Tubeless Puncture Plugs</strong> </a>($55 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F201768%2Fmuc-off-stealth-tubeless-puncture-plug-kit%3Fcolor%3DIRIDESCENT\">REI</a>) that secure neatly into your bar ends, packing a plug tool, serrated knife to trim the excess, and 10 worms/plugs. They come in lots of cool colors, too. For some reason, we’ve even spotted them up to 75% off directly from Muc-Off. Maybe they made too many? Anyway, you should jump on that. If your riding buddy already has a fav tubeless repair kit, you can always buy them a set of <strong>Puncture Plugs Refills</strong> ($7 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F173887%2Fmuc-off-puncture-plug-refills%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">REI</a>) too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your MTBer is using an old, cheap, or roadie’s high-pressure pump, the <strong>ToPeak Shuttle Gauge </strong>($58 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0784MVK5P/?tag=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg-20\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>) is perfect for helping them dial in a lower, more appropriate MTB pressure. It attaches to your valve stem or pump and gives a digital read-out that’s way more accurate than that tiny analog gauge way down at the bottom of the pump. The rotating head works with all valve types, including air forks and shocks, and an air release button allows fine-tuning pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flats suck, but a crappy pump sucks even more. We love these two high-volume mini pumps for MTB, but for different reasons. The <strong>OneUp EDC Pump</strong> ($65 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Foneup-components-edc-pump\">Competitive Cyclist</a>) combines with their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-oneup-edc-tool-edc-stem-combo-no-more-steerer-tapping/\"><strong>EDC V2 Tool</strong></a> ($65 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Foneup-components-edc-pump\">Competitive Cyclist</a>) and <strong>Plug Pliers Kit</strong> ($39.50 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Foneup-components-edc-plug-plier-kit\">Competitive Cyclist</a>) to hide a mini tool and tire plug kit inside the barrel, and it mounts under your water bottle cage. If you ride with a hip pack or no pack, it’s a great way to carry the repair bits you need without having to wear it. And it’s a great pump, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This one is a little sneaky coming just under the cost threshold, but we’re pretty excited by the latest <strong><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-rides-galfer-shark-lightweight-160mm-xc-rotor-can-save-grams-without-losing-power/\">Galfer Shark Rotors</a></strong> (from $95 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F230490%2Fgalfer-shark-disc-brake-rotor%3Fcolor%3DSILVER\">REI</a>). That cost is per rotor, and you are gonna need two. But… We’ve upgraded a downcountry bike to the thinner 1.8mm lightweight 160mm rotors and love their powerful braking. And boosted brake power and modulation on an all-mountain bike with the thicker 2.0mm x 180mm rotors. Both deliver excellent power, modulation &amp; consistent braking in all conditions – with Galfer or Sinter pads. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Mountain Bike Gifts for Under $150</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-150-dollars-scaled-copy.jpg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1451\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-150-dollars-scaled-copy.jpg\" alt=\"Best Gifts for mountain bikers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-150-dollars-scaled-copy.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-150-dollars-scaled-copy-297x168.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-150-dollars-scaled-copy-800x453.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-150-dollars-scaled-copy-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-150-dollars-scaled-copy-768x435.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-150-dollars-scaled-copy-1536x871.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-150-dollars-scaled-copy-2048x1161.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Good head protection often doesn’t come cheap. But if the mountain biker on your list (or you) has taken a fall or two last season, it’s time for a new helmet. Or if they just haven’t gotten a new lid in a few years. Well, the <strong>Lazer Coyote KinetiCore</strong> ($110 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingbikepackergg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F217603%2Flazer-coyote-kineticore-bike-helmet%3Fcolor%3DMATTE%2520CALI\">REI</a>) is a just-right mix of trail-ready protection and affordability. Lots of open vents, good retention, and Lazer’s take on brain protection with their KinetiCore foam. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>AbsoluteBlack PVD Rainbow MTB chainrings</strong> ($120, available in <a href=\"https://absoluteblack.cc/premium-sram-oval-boost-direct-mount-chainring-pvd-rainbow/\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM</a> and <a href=\"https://absoluteblack.cc/oval-direct-mount-shimano-12spd-pvd-rainbow-chainring\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano</a> direct-mount versions directly from the brand and other versions can also be found at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fsearch%3Fs%3Du%26q%3DAbsoluteBlack%2BPVD%2BRainbow%2BMTB%2Bchainrings\">Competitive Cyclist</a>) are light, stiff, and gorgeous. Don’t be fooled by the arty appearance though, these rings have great chain retention and longevity, too. Go for the oval version and they’ll be surprised at how much more efficient they feel climbing, too! Just be sure to get the right version (<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/absoluteblack-spill-out-pvd-coated-rainbow-oval-chainrings-for-sram-direct-mount/\">SRAM</a> or Shimano), and match the tooth count they’re currently running…or ask, they may want to try a different size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure saddles are often a personal preference, but you probably also know a buddy in your trail riding group with a scuffed or even torn-up seat. The <strong><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bikeyoke-sagma-saddle-with-carbon-or-lite-regular-rails-plus-barkeeper-raw-stem/\">BikeYoke Sagma</a></strong> ($135 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085KD9XZN/?tag=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg-20\">Amazon</a>) saddle does something unique, bringing a little tunable rider comfort thanks to its special elastomer-rocker suspension rail setup. There are slightly lighter carbon-railed or classic fixed rail options, but we’d stick with the alloy suspension rails for the performance: value ratio. Pick an all-black top, or a bit of color to coordinate with your favorite MTBer’s ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jaybird Vista 2 Earbuds</strong> ($150, available at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B3H688Q/?tag=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg-20\">Amazon</a>) is one of the best action sports earbuds around. They’re true wireless, meaning you can use just one at a time to maintain outside awareness, and they’re waterproof and stay put even on the roughest trails. Plus the sound quality and battery life are great! The newer Vista 2 adds more features, but we’ve found that the original blocks wind noise better at riding speed, and they’re $50 less!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re like us, you like to bring lots of gear with you for the ride to make sure you have the right combo. The<strong> Thule Round Trip Bike Duffle</strong> ($160, available at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F166648%2Fthule-bike-gear-locker-duffel\">REI</a>) keeps it all organized and ensures we don’t forget anything! It covers all the bases; a large compartment for clothing, that you can segment to fit smaller bundles and stay organized. The beefy zipper is perfect for overpacking (we all do it) and separate side compartments are ideal for muddy shoes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best MTB Gifts Under $275</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-275-dollars-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-275-dollars-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Best Gifts for mountain bikers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-275-dollars-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-275-dollars-297x158.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-275-dollars-800x427.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-275-dollars-120x64.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-275-dollars-768x410.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-275-dollars-1536x819.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-275-dollars-2048x1092.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Winter is cold, but that doesn’t mean you have to be. The <strong>Endura Freezing Point Pants</strong> ($200, available at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCH5TZ52/?tag=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg-20\">Amazon</a>) will keep you warm on whatever bike you’re riding. The DWR coating, PrimaLoft Gold insulation, and stretchy material will ensure you can ride for as long as the daylight allows. These pants are perfect for the fat biker on your list and pack a killer double punch as the best sled riding pants in the world!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or just get them some new tires. If you are looking to give your favorite mountain bike unquestionable performance, give them a set of <strong><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/maxxis-celebrate-20-years-of-shred-with-ltd-ed-minion-dhf-w-heavy-metal-graphics/\">Maxxis Minion DHF &amp; DHR II tires</a></strong> – even though it’ll cost you up to around a hundred bucks per tire (find them at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dmaxxis%2Bminion\">REI</a> or <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fsearch%3Fs%3Du%26q%3Dmaxxis%2Bminion\">Competitive Cyclist</a>). There’s a reason that the Minion is a tire that’s been around for more than 20 years and it still popping up as a standard OEM spec on premium trail, all-mountain, and enduro bikes. It is the benchmark against which all other mixed-conditions mountain bike tires are measured. And I would love to unwrap a present and find a <strong>Minion DHF 29x 2.50WT 3CG EXO+</strong> ($101) and <strong>DHR II 29x 2.40WT 3CT EXO+</strong> ($106) pair inside! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up top, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/velocio-ultralight-rain-jacket-alpha-long-sleeve-jersey-review/\"><strong>Velocio’s Alpha Long Sleeve shir</strong>t</a> ($199 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=17985&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvelocio.cc%2Fproducts%2Fmens-alpha-long-sleeve-jersey\">Velocio</a>) isn’t really a MTB product per se, but we’ve been using it a ton off-road through the colder months. For those year-round mountain bikers, this excellent insulated mid-layer combines Polartec Alpha Direct up front for maximum warmth with mid-weight merino sides &amp; back for better temperature regulation. Wear it on its own on top for cool rides. Layer it under a light shell for cold weather, or under a heavier softshell for truly arctic riding. It’s available in a wide size range for men or women, and has classic rear jersey pockets to carry extra snacks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This one sneaks in just under our arbitrary “absolutely expensive gift” category. But look at it another way and this is actually 3 gifts for the price of 1. The new lightweight convertible <strong><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/leatt-3-0-enduro-convertible-helmet-snaps-on-protection-full-face-3-4-or-just-your-head/\">Leatt 3.0 Enduro MTB helmet</a></strong> ($270 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJCH4JY7/?tag=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg-20\">Amazon</a>) gives you full-face gravity protection, a 3/4 shell for extra enduro ear coverage, or a classic trail halfshell. The removable ear covers or chin bar snap securely in place, or are easy enough to remove for less aggressive riding. I like the feeling of extra protection on technical downhills, but love that I can quickly pop the ears or chin off for extended climbing so I don’t overheat. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Winter is the time for maintenance, and mountain bikes can use more than most. Getting the mountain bikers on your list a <strong>Gift Certificate</strong> for service from your <strong>Local Bike Shop</strong> is a great way to start the season. Your local shop will make sure your ride is in primo condition, get your fork serviced, and dial in your ride for the winter months ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Very Expensive Gifts for Mountain Bikers over $300</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-300-dollars.jpg\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-300-dollars.jpg\" alt=\"Best Gifts for mountain bikers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-300-dollars.jpg 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-300-dollars-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-300-dollars-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-300-dollars-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-300-dollars-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-300-dollars-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-300-dollars-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Best-Gifts-for-Mountain-Bikers_MTB-Gift-Guide-300-dollars-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest <strong>Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Smartwatch</strong> ($800 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F183345%2Fgarmin-fenix-6-pro-solar-multisport-gps-watch%3Fcolor%3DBLACK%2FBLACK\">REI</a>) is the ultimate gift for an avid Mountain Biker. With a variety of features like GPS mapping, wrist heart rate, pulse Ox2, grade-adjusted pacing guidance, and music syncing, your favorite mountain biker will be able to log all sorts of ride and workout data to keep them on track toward their cycling and fitness goals. The battery lasts for up to 14 days between charges, so they’ll never have to worry about their watch keeping up with them! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it is cold, wet &amp; muddy out on the trails, it’s hard to beat an MTB onesie for comfort and convenience. We’ve been riding in the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2023-leatt-adds-hydradri-foul-weather-gear-new-head-knee-protection-more-womens-kit/\"><strong>Leatt Mono Suit 5.0</strong> </a>($400 at <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=5623&amp;awinaffid=723761&amp;campaign=&amp;clickref=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chainreactioncycles.com%2Fus%2Fp%2Fleatt-mtb-hydradri-5-0-mono-suit&amp;platform=pl\">Chain Reaction</a>), a fully seam-taped waterproof one-piece combo of foul-weather mountain biking jacket and pants. And we couldn’t be more stoked. The fit and adjustability are great thanks to integrated suspenders inside. It is surprisingly breathable for how weatherproof it is. And at the end of a nasty ride, I just slide out of the suit and I’m clean and dry inside! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, so not only is it wet out there now, but it’s also dark. But the <strong><a href=\"https://www.lupinenorthamerica.com/product/blika-r7-smartcore-helmet-light-system/\">Lupine Blika</a></strong> ($500 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BV2X1RD/?tag=brbgoutdoorbikingmtbgg-20\">Amazon</a>) will light up the trail, now and for years to come. A high-end German bike light is certainly an extravagant purchase. But we love the Blika. Its 2400lm output is as bright as you’ll ever need. Controlled by a Bluetooth remote with tons of customizable settings, it can last as long as you want. We recommend adding the QR handlebar mount for quick after-work rides. The big 6.9Ah battery for long trips. But you can also pick a smaller battery and headlamp strap for off-bike use, too. Again, we have a full MTB Lights Buyer’s Guide if you want to see more options.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can’t stand the trainer and crave the feel of the trails, there’s only one thing to do — locate the nearest Indoor Bike Park and grab a season pass. Parks like <strong><a href=\"http://www.thewheelmill.com/gift-cards-2/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wheel Mill</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://raysmtb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ray’s Indoor</a></strong>, and more are all gearing up for the winter rush and you should take advantage of the season pass sales. Indoor Bike Parks are the perfect place to dial in your handling, have some fun learning new tricks and connect with the cycling community. Plus — you don’t have to get decked out in winter gear to ride! If one of these MTB funhouses is close by, a pass can easily top the list of best gifts for mountain bikers.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-gifts-for-mountain-bikers-mtb/\">The Best Gifts for Mountain Bikers: What to Get Your Favorite MTB Rider</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"cc6ace9659c13d6cba4c947efcb092e400bf506c3054c8efdfad13ca83782585","category":"Cycling"}
