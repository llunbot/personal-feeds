If you liked blasting people out of windows in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/09/gunpoint-hands-on-an-intelligent-spy-thriller-with-breakable-glass/\"><em>Gunpoint</em></a> or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/ars-technicas-best-video-games-of-2017/2/\"><em>Heat Signature</em></a>—or snappy writing, endearing characters, wizards, turn-based tactical gameplay, and efficiency challenges—you are going to love <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043810/Tactical_Breach_Wizards/\"><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></a>.</p>\n<p>The game's name is as efficient as its design, telling you a lot about its tone and distinct offerings. You play as a small team of magic wielders, each of which you can control, one at a time, in a world where magic use, mana, and all the rest have been militarized and corporatized. There are stasis hexes put on illegally parked cars and even a Traffic Warlock, who, after getting on his bad side, will try to mow you down with an entire ghost highway full of spectral drivers.</p>\n<div><div></div><p><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> launch trailer. </p></div>\n<p>Luckily, bad guys like him can only hit you if you don't plan accordingly. Owing to the powers of your teammate Zan, you can foresee everything that will happen within a round of combat (he's a one-second clairvoyant). Move team member Jen to this square on the grid, have her chain-zap three guys, seal the door next to her, then see what that leaves Zan to do. Don't like the outcome? Rewind repeatedly until you've gotten the most out of your team's actions or maybe achieved one of the game's optional achievements. You get \"Confidence\" for pulling off stunts like \"knock three baddies out a window with one action,\" but they're entirely optional because Confidence only unlocks cool outfits, not powers or gameplay. The actual perks you unlock give you delicious choices to make, deciding which way to take each character's powers to complement or offset one another.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044560#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044560&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ab54929ec0aa3681271715aeb58c7543df08e6df964cdde26509169d948000ab","category":"Tech"}
