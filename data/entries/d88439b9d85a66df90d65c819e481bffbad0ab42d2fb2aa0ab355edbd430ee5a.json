For example, you can effortlessly analyze and summarize content, get explanations on complex topics, or create meeting summaries without switching between applications.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Let’s get started</strong></span> <br />Let me walk you through how to get started with the new browser extensions and integrations. First, let’s look at the browser extensions. The following screenshot shows how it looks.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/27/news-2024-q-business-integrations-r14-1.png\" width=\"3822\" height=\"2018\" /></p> \n<p>As an administrator, I need to enable the browser extensions for users of my Amazon Q Business application.
