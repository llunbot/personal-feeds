The fact that some of these made-up products actually fool some people should tell you something about the state of the bike industry, but Joe McEwan from Starling Cycles decided to take it a step further this year with an April Fools’ ‘rant’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>From Starling Cycles</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>April Fools’..? Rather than pretending to rebrand or make a goofy bike, Joe fancied a bit of a rant. You see, Joe’s biggest gripe is the idea that more technology, more money and more marketing BS equals more performance. When, in fact, it’s usually the opposite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>April Fools’ is all about fooling people, all about a bit of BS. And Joe reckons the industry spends every day fooling people that more bikes mean more speed, more performance and more fun. We’re constantly being told that if we chase the latest and the greatest, the newest and the shiniest, 15% more of this and 5% more of that then we’ll be better riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it’s not all about throwing money at the problem. There’s more to it than that and – he reckons. It’s more about the thing stuck on top of the bike, than the bike itself. It’s more about hard yards than hard cash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for this year’s April Fools’ Joe has gone for a bit of a rant instead, talking all about BS in the bike industry and the April Fools’ joke that gets played on everyone every day of the year. All, of course, meant in good spirits and with a bit of tongue in cheek!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/starling-cycles-says-every-day-is-april-fools-in-the-bike-industry/\">Starling Cycles Says Every Day is April Fools’ in the Bike Industry</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1e2c90edb5836acd8873c0f3a8f71aa71aac9b2d6da5d03e42abd166ed5b0bb6","category":"Cycling"}
