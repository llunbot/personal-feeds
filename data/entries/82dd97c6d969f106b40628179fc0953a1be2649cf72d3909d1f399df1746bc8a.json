And sure enough, iOS 15.2 began its beta test period just a day after iOS 15.1 was released on October 25, 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As is typical of these releases, it is first available only to registered developers. The public beta typically follows within a day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Update 11/09/21:</strong> iOS 15.2 beta 2 is now available for developers, adding the Communication Safety in Messages feature for parental controls. The public beta typically follows within a day.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New features in iOS 15.2</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>App Privacy Report</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-15_2-release-notes&amp;xcust=1-1-547488-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple’s release notes</a>, iOS 15.2 brings the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8/&amp;xcust=1-1-547488-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">App Privacy Report</a>, which is basically a new interface for the <em>Record App Activity</em> feature.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ios-15-app-privacy-report.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /><figcaption><p>The App Privacy Report in iOS 15 offers a detailed view of how apps are using your data and sensors.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Communication Safety feature in Messages</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the release of iOS 15, Apple announced a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/352875/ios-15-csam-scanning-icloud-photos-messages-siri-search-faq.html\">CSAM feature</a> to detect child sexual abuse and trafficking in iCloud photos. It also announced a new parental controls feature for Messages, whereby a parent can enable a feature for their child’s phone to warn them if adult content is shared in Messages. This is separate from the CSAM scanning and has to be enabled in parental controls. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the iOS 15.2 update, Apple is making the Messages child safety parental control available, but it has not yet rolled out the iCloud Photos CSAM feature. Apple said it will delay the launch of that feature while it re-works it to address complaints from privacy advocates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to get the iOS 15.2 beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a developer, head to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/download/&amp;xcust=1-1-547488-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">developer.apple.com/download/</a> on the device upon which you wish to run the beta.
