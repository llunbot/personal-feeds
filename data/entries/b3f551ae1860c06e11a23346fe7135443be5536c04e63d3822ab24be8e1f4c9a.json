Alternatively, users can set the Action button to enable a single-click \"Open Halide\" shortcut or open a Shortcut Menu with a list of options. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, Halide includes new optimizations for capturing with 5× telephoto on iPhone 15 Pro Max, taking advantage of zero shutter lag for iPhone 15 Pro, and other enhancements. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/halide-action-button-triggers.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://halide.cam/download\">Halide 2.13</a> is a free update for existing users.
