For the entire year, most mainstream components have been available at or a little under their official retail prices, making it possible to build all kinds of PCs at relatively reasonable prices without worrying about restocks or waiting for discounts. It was a welcome continuation of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/2022-in-gpus-the-shortage-ends-but-higher-prices-seem-here-to-stay/\">some GPU trends</a> that started in 2022. Nvidia, AMD, and Intel could release a new GPU, and you could consistently buy that GPU for roughly what it was supposed to cost.</p>\n<p>That's where we get into how frustrating 2023 was for GPU buyers, though. Cards like the GeForce RTX 4090 and Radeon RX 7900 series launched in late 2022 and boosted performance beyond what any last-generation cards could achieve. But 2023's midrange GPU launches were less ambitious. Not only did they offer the performance of a last-generation GPU, but most of them did it for around the same price as the last-gen GPUs whose performance they matched.</p>\n<h2>The midrange runs in place</h2>\n<p>Not every midrange GPU launch will get us a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/07/nvidia-gtx-1060-review/\">GTX 1060</a>â€”a card roughly 50 percent faster than its immediate predecessor and beat the previous-generation GTX 980 despite costing just a bit over half as much money. But even if your expectations were low, this year's midrange GPU launches have been underwhelming.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991746#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991746&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c098129a08f0501d2929f7010ad72e5a6d8859008e7d6e883bc0291d310b53ed","category":"Tech"}
