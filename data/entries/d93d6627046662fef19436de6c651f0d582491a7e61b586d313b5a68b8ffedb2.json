The 15A/1800W outlet also features Power Protection, which automatically turns off devices when the power exceeds a user-specified threshold.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe aforementioned energy monitoring is accessed via the Tapo app, providing tracking of the outlet's energy use through stats and charts. Users can save money on their bills by scheduling devices to turn off during periods of inactivity. Note that this dual-socket model also has manual on/off buttons for each outlet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe all-important Matter support over Wi-Fi eliminates the need for an additional hub, but a controller is necessary. In Apple Home terms, that equates to an Apple TV 4K (2021 and 2022 models), HomePod (both generations), or HomePod mini.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTapo-P210M-Compatible-Monitoring-SmartThings%2Fdp%2FB0DLLQR3K7%2F\">Tapo Smart Wi-Fi Outlet</a> retails at $30, but it is currently listed as on sale at <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTapo-P210M-Compatible-Monitoring-SmartThings%2Fdp%2FB0DLLQR3K7%2F\">Amazon.com</a>, with a 33% discount bringing the price below $20. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<small><em>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.
