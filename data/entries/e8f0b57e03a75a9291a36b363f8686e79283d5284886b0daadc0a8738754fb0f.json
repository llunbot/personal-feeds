She arrived to see him clutching his stomach and took him home. About two hours later, he lost consciousness and was rushed to the hospital, where he died.</p>\n<p>The teen had told his mother that he had eaten a Paqui chip—The 2023 Paqui One Chip Challenge chip, to be exact. Each chip is sold individually, wrapped in a foil pouch and packaged in a coffin-shaped box adorned with a skull, snakes, and a Grim Reaper. The box contains the challenge rules, which dare consumers to eat the whole chip and \"wait as long as possible before drinking or eating anything\"—and, of course, post reactions on social media.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966876#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966876&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e8f0b57e03a75a9291a36b363f8686e79283d5284886b0daadc0a8738754fb0f","category":"Tech"}
