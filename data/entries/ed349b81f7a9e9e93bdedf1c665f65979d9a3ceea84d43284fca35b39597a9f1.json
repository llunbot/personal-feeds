If you need the latest hardware, sure, it’s worth it, but if you just need a reliable computer for school, work, or home, you don’t have to pay that much. This MacBook Air would normally cost $1,499, but now it’s only $509.97. There are only a few left. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 13.3″ Retina display and Apple’s M1 chip make this MacBook Air well worth the (low) price. With an 8-core CPU, it’s up to 3.5x faster than previous models, so things like video editing and browsing are a lot smoother. The 8-core GPU also boosts graphics performance, ideal for running demanding apps. And with up to 18 hours of battery life, you don’t have to go searching for an outlet on long days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This MacBook is fanless and super quiet. It also has a 128GB SSD and Wi-Fi 6, so you’re good to load up on apps or just enjoy lag-free streaming. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why the discount? While this is technically refurbished, it doesn’t look like it. That grade “A” rating means it’s in near-mint condition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>March 30 at 11:59 p.m. PT is the deadline to get a <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/macbook-air-m1-2020-13-3-8gb-ram-128gb-ssd-space-gray-mgn63ll-a-refurb?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=macbook-air-m1-2020-13-3-8gb-ram-128gb-ssd-space-gray-mgn63ll-a-refurb&amp;utm_term=scsf-615917&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003RqQbIAK&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">MacBook Air</a> on sale for $509.97 </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/macbook-air-m1-2020-13-3-8gb-ram-128gb-ssd-space-gray-mgn63ll-a-refurb?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=macbook-air-m1-2020-13-3-8gb-ram-128gb-ssd-space-gray-mgn63ll-a-refurb&amp;utm_term=scsf-615917&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003RqQbIAK&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp2.stackassets.com/72ba693ba522fdeebb3c20d31bc65c6099ca0a23/store/e2309106514b0fd628aeeddb4a3130e32b7b8dc72212f4b1d951433c3f8b/sale_xxx_primary_image.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple MacBook Air 13.3″ (2020) M1 MGN63LL/A 8GB RAM 128GB SSD Space Gray (Refurbished) – $509.97</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/macbook-air-m1-2020-13-3-8gb-ram-128gb-ssd-space-gray-mgn63ll-a-refurb?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=macbook-air-m1-2020-13-3-8gb-ram-128gb-ssd-space-gray-mgn63ll-a-refurb&amp;utm_term=scsf-615917&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003RqQbIAK&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com/\" target=\"_blank\">StackSocial</a> prices subject to change. </em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ed349b81f7a9e9e93bdedf1c665f65979d9a3ceea84d43284fca35b39597a9f1","category":"Apple"}
