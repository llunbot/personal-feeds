Apple hasn’t provided any means of changing it going back as far as we can remember–thus the iPhone’s long-standing ascending three-note sound has become somewhat synonymous with smartphone notifications. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, Apple has always let you change the notification sound for certain apps such as Messages and Mail, and even some specific <em>types</em> of notifications (like your Ring doorbell). But for most alerts, you get what Apple gives you which, until iOS 17 was called Tri-tone. When iOS 17 launched, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2069398/ios-17-new-ringtones-text-tones.html\">updated a bunch of tones and sounds</a>, changing the default alert from Tri-tone to Rebound. It’s a less harsh sound, but some users complained it’s also less noticeable and perhaps quieter, and they wanted to go back. Until now, they couldn’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With iOS 17.2, Apple’s going to do you one better: Not only can you restore the sound to Tri-tone, you can finally change the default notification sound and haptics to whatever you want. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First spotted in<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2117707/ios-17-2-beta-is-out-now-and-includes-the-journal-app.html\"> iOS 17.2 beta 4</a>, all you have to do is open the Settings app, tap <em>Sound &amp; Haptics</em>, and look for the new <em>Default Alerts</em> setting. Tap that and you can restore the notification sound to Tri-tone (you’ll find that within <em>Classic</em>), or use any other alert sound you wish. You can also change the haptics for your default sound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s an overdue change, to say the least. Couples everywhere will no longer need to ask “Was that my phone or yours?” when an alert comes in. Thank you, Apple.</p>\n\niOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9bd299e81f025fae6d27f57457fed433e1c50abc668b4660f7b0f14ae9d6903c","category":"Apple"}
