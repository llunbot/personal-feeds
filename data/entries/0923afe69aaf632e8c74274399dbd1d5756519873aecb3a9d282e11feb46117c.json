The company now faces potential claims from its equipment partners, some of whom had also invested in the project without formal contracts in place. LG also moved equipment from Gumi in Gyeongsangbuk-do to Paju in Gyeonggi-do, secured space for the microLED backplane process, and recruited specialized personnel to form a task force dedicated to the project.

Despite its potential advantages—such as brighter displays, improved color accuracy, and better power efficiency compared to existing OLED technology—Apple determined that the production costs associated with microLED were too high to justify its inclusion in the Apple Watch. There were also significant challenges related to the manufacturing process, which would have made it more difficult to produce the displays in the required quantities.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lg-display/\">LG Display</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/\">microLED Apple Watch</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-elec/\">The Elec</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/lg-seeking-compensation-from-apple-over-microled/\">LG Seeking Compensation From Apple Over Canceled MicroLED Apple Watch Project</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lg-seeking-compensation-from-apple-over-canceled-microled-apple-watch-project.2433448/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0923afe69aaf632e8c74274399dbd1d5756519873aecb3a9d282e11feb46117c","category":"Apple"}
