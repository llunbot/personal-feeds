The P<strong><em><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>rime Big Deal Days starts just after midnight on</em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></em></strong> October 8th and runs for 48 hours until midnight on the 9th. We’ll be updating this article with the best Apple Watch deals as we see them, so stay tuned for the best Amazon Prime Day Apple Watch deals!</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon’s Prime Day sales event (which lasts two days, not just one!) is a fantastic opportunity to find a good deal on the Apple Watch, so if you were wondering if the Apple Watch will be on sale for Prime Day, wonder no more! We are seeing some great discounts on the Apple Watch for the Prime Day sale, which runs from just after midnight on Tuesday, October 8 to midnight on October 9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here at Macworld, we know more than most about Apple’s range of products, and we can spot a bargain too, having compiled regular Apple deals roundups for years. We’re not likely to be fooled by the usual tricks, such as prices being raised just before a sales event so the discounts look bigger. We’ll make sure to steer you to the genuinely worthwhile deals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s only recently updated the Apple Watch, with the 10th generation model replacing the Apple Watch Series 9. As a result, you can expect to see some decent deals on the older model. And because Apple didn’t update the Apple Watch Ultra or the Apple Watch SE this time round we expect to see money off those models too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch models picked here are all chosen by our editors, who have decades of experience with Apple devices. We’ve reviewed everything we recommend and we won’t tell you to buy something that’s not an actual deal. The products below are all at or near all-time lows, and we’ve selected what we think is the best configuration for each product type. We know Apple is expensive, so we’ve chosen products at prices we would be willing to pay, so you can trust that our recommendations will steer you in the right direction—and save you big bucks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more coverage of Amazon’s deals, check out our round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2391988/best-apple-prime-day-2024-deals.html\">best Apple Deals for Amazon Prime day</a> as well as our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/prime-day\">Prime Day listings page</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Apple Watch deals for Prime Big Deals Days</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some deals are better than others.
