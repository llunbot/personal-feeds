{"title":"Google will pay you an absurd amount for your iPhone if you switch to a Pixel Fold","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/1915412/google-pixel-fold-iphone-trade-in-prices.html","date":1683901817000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re intrigued by the new <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/742457/google-pixel-fold.html\">Pixel Fold</a> and have an iPhone, Google is making it very easy to switch. If you preorder a Pixel Fold, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://store.google.com/config/pixel_fold&amp;xcust=1-1-1915412-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Google is paying</a> as much as $950 for a used iPhone, nearly as much as the original MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the maximum amount, you’ll need to trade in an iPhone 14 Pro Max ($950), iPhone 14 Pro ($900), or iPhone 14 Plus ($750). The iPhone 14 Pro has the least depreciation, with a trade-in value of just $99 less than the MSRP, though the other models hold their value too at just $149 less than Apple’s retail price. For whatever reason, the iPhone 14 only nets you $350 for a $799 phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year’s Pro models will net you a fantastic rate as well. Google is offering $900 for the iPhone 13 Pro Max and $850 for the iPhone 13 Pro, but just $220 for the iPhone 13 and a paltry $180 for the iPhone 13 mini. For comparison, Apple offers up to $630 for the iPhone 13 Pro Max, $530 for the iPhone Pro, $400 for the iPhone 13, and $330 for the iPhone 13 mini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the rest of the trade-in values:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>iPhone 12 Pro Max: $800</li><li>iPhone 12 Pro: $204.80</li><li>iPhone 12: $165.60</li><li>iPhone 12 mini: $106.40</li><li>iPhone 11 Pro Max: $168</li><li>iPhone 11 Pro: $112.80</li><li>iPhone 11: $240</li><li>iPhone XS Max: $96</li><li>iPhone XS: $73</li><li>iPhone XR: $77</li><li>iPhone X: $57</li><li>iPhone SE (2022): $80.80</li><li>iPhone SE (2020): $28.01</li><li>iPhone 8 Plus: $50</li><li>iPhone 8: $39</li><li>iPhone 7 Plus: $33.01</li><li>iPhone 7: $28</li><li>iPhone 6s Plus: $40</li><li>iPhone 6 Plus: $32</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These prices reflect the lowest storage tier for each model. For some, Google will give you an extra $10 for each extra storage tier. But even if you have the highest storage option, you’re still not getting that much. For instance, Apple will give you up to $350 for the iPhone 12 Pro and $300 for the iPhone 12.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The high prices for the newer iPhones tell us a couple of things. For one, Google is targeting iPhone users with its new $1,799 Pixel Fold. And it knows how we’ll the iPhone retains its value—consider that its own Pixel 7 Pro, which sells for $799, will only get you $380 toward a Pixel Fold. So if you’re tired of waiting for Apple to launch its own folding phone, consider swapping for a Pixel. Just be warned—you probably won’t get as much for your used Pixel when you switch back.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"fee2722042a39954f86a54cd8f6472edd2077e6a0bad20e51afa5b9590455bb2","category":"Apple"}
