Geekbench 6 benchmark results showed the M4 chip offers <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/m4-ipad-pro-cpu-benchmark/\">up to 25% faster multi-core CPU performance</a> compared to the M3 chip found in several current Macs. The M4 chip is available with up to a 10-core CPU, whereas the M3 chip has an 8-core CPU. Apple has yet to announce higher-end M4 Pro and M4 Max chips.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBelow, we reiterate what has been rumored for these first M4 Macs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>MacBook Pro</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-mbp-space-black.jpg\" width=\"1440\" height=\"810\" />\r<br />\nApple plans to announce updated 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/15/m4-macs-and-new-ipads-at-next-apple-event/\">in the coming weeks</a>, according to Gurman. No design changes have been rumored for the laptops this year, with improvements such as an OLED display and thinner design not expected <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/10/macbook-pro-wont-switch-to-oled-in-2025-rumor/\">until 2026 at the earliest</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple last redesigned the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro in 2021, and the latest models with M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips were released last October.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iMac</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/M4-iMac-Feature-Teal.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple also plans to update the iMac with the M4 chip in the coming weeks, according to Gurman. No design changes are expected for the desktop computer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAn unanswered question: Will the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad accessories for the iMac finally switch from Lightning to USB-C this year?\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Mac mini</h2>\r<br />\n<div><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/M4-Mac-mini-Black-Ortho-Cooler.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" /><em>A concept of a smaller Mac mini</em></div>\r<br />\nGurman expects the Mac mini to be updated with M4 and M4 Pro chips in the coming weeks, and he said the desktop computer will be redesigned to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/mac-mini-to-become-smallest-ever-apple-computer/\">become nearly as small as an Apple TV</a>. The new Mac mini will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/01/mac-mini-to-lose-usb-a-ports-later-this-year/\">apparently lack USB-A ports</a>, and instead <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/16/mac-mini-5-usb-c-ports-leak/\">feature five USB-C ports</a>, including two on the front of the computer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis would be the Mac mini's first major redesign since 2010.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 14 &amp; 16\" </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/m4-macs-reportedly-on-track-for-this-year/\">MacBook Pro, iMac, and Redesigned Mac Mini With M4 Chips on Track to Launch 'This Year'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-pro-imac-and-redesigned-mac-mini-with-m4-chips-on-track-to-launch-this-year.2438847/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aed9b2a93835b496f0be6457421654473e6c8afc5c3f4e4ecfb6c9d8f04ea5b1","category":"Apple"}
