Today’s deal helps: Amazon is selling the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J72NMV/\">M4 iPad Pro with 2TB of storage and 16GB of RAM for $1,599</a>, an amazing $400 off for the very first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This 11-inch iPad Pro has everything you could wish for from a tablet and more. It’s just about perfect for design work and image editing, and can easily replace your laptop if you <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1826855-REG/apple_mwr03ll_a_magic_keyboard_for_11.html\">attach a keyboard</a> and bring along an Apple Pencil Pro (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J71RM7\">also on sale for $99</a>). It’s so good, we gave it <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369843/m4-ipad-pro-1tb-review.html\">M4 iPad Pro a full 5-star rating</a>, loving the incredibly thin design, gorgeous OLED display, fantastic performance, and long-lasting battery life. “The new iPad Pro is the best tablet you can currently get. Its performance and range of functions are first-class, while the new OLED display saves on weight and makes a flatter chassis possible,” our review notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to get an iPad with less storage space, Amazon is also selling the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J6L2ZC/\">256GB model for $899</a> ($100 off) and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J9G6SP/\">the 512GB model for $1,050</a> ($149 off). However, the discount that impressed us the most is a whopping $400 off the 2TB model. So, if you want the most impressive 11-inch iPad made, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J72NMV/\">go order one at Amazon for $1,599</a> before the price jumps back up.</p>\n\n\n<span>Save $400 on the M4 iPad Pro</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J72NMV/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"447a6cd3662f0caa3cd5e7092d0692e28ab9712d147ac97f4fb9e3aad3c13694","category":"Apple"}
