So yeah, it's a lot.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010762#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010762&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"dcaebf141d67c80cfff966ea9dbf08019e007040164fb5c3a16813d45b045c57","category":"Tech"}
