Over to you, Warren.</p>\n<h3>Warren Rossiter’s verdict</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Vitus Venon Evo is our overall Road Bike of the Year for 2023.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>“Well, let me start with a bold statement – the Vitus Venon Evo RS Aero Force AXS is everything an endurance bike should be and more.</p>\n<p>“The idea behind the latest Venon Evo was to make an endurance bike that would appeal to as many riders as possible.</p>\n<p>“So that’s lightness and handling that would appeal to racers, year-round readiness for serious all-weather enthusiasts, and versatility to appeal to riders who want to switch it up between road and gravel.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Vitus has reimagined the Venon Evo as an endurance road bike with gravel credentials.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>“Over the past few years, we’ve seen bikes become ever-more niche and segmented, all of which can make choosing a new bike difficult.</p>\n<p>“On the road, do you go back to aerodynamics with a speed machine like another of our contenders, the Giant Propel? Or is a flighty, lightweight road racer like the Enve Melee more your style?</p>\n<p>“What about the speed-infused comfort from Scott’s Contessa or cost-effective performance from Cannondale’s Optimo?</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Venon Evo is available in road and gravel builds. We tested a SRAM Force AXS-equipped road spec with Prime Primavera 44 carbon wheels.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>“And if gravel is your thing, do you venture towards the mountain bike world with the trail-capable Giant Revolt X or take aim at gravel races with BMC’s fully focused Kaius?</p>\n<p>“Well, for us here at BikeRadar, we’re embracing the all-rounder instead.</p>\n<p>“Vitus has achieved something seriously special with the new Venon Evo. A bike that’s as good as any endurance bike on the road, but which has versatility at its heart.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 28c Michelin Power Cup Classic tyres provide bags of grip and comfort.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>“You can get huge 45c tyres into the frame to make it into a very capable gravel machine. Or add mudguards and high-volume road tyres to turn it into a long-distance audax rider and beyond.</p>\n<p>“Its low weight and lively handling bring that all-important smile to every ride, so it combines the sensible with the sensational.</p>\n<p>“Best of all, the build comes with aero carbon wheels, carbon fibre finishing kit and a SRAM Force AXS wireless drivetrain at a price (£4,699/$4,699/€4,899) very few can match.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Vitus’ direct-sales model ensures there’s plenty of value-for-money on offer, too.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>“Against a backdrop of inflation and sky-rocketing bike prices, Vitus needs to be applauded and celebrated for delivering value and versatility, alongside all-round quality and, crucially, the fun factor.</p>\n<p>“A very rare thing indeed in 2023.”</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/vitus-venon-evo-rs-aero-force-axs-review/\">Read Warren’s full review of the Vitus Venon Evo RS Aero Force AXS</a></li>\n</ul><h4>Endurance Bike of the Year contenders</h4>\n<p>We’ll be bringing you full reviews of all five Endurance Bike of the Year contenders over the next month.</p>\n<ul><li>Cervélo Caledonia Rival AXS</li>\n<li>Merida Scultura Endurance Rival AXS</li>\n<li>Rondo RATT CF2</li>\n<li>Vitus Venon Evo RS Aero</li>\n<li>Wilier Triestina Granturismo SLR</li>\n</ul><section><div>\n        \n<h4>Meet the tester | Warren Rossiter</h4>\n<p>BikeRadar and <em>Cycling Plus</em>‘ senior technical editor, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/warrenrossiter/\">Warren Rossiter</a>, a stalwart of our Bike of the Year test for more than a decade, took charge of the endurance category.</p>\n<p>After a two-hour shakedown ride, the meat of testing took place on an 82-mile/132km loop of Warren’s home lanes in Wiltshire, in the south west of England, resulting in more than 1,200 miles/1,931km of riding across the five bikes.</p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>The best of the rest…</h2>\n<p>As well as crowning the Vitus Venon Evo as our overall Road Bike of the Year (and the winner of our endurance sub-category), we’ve also announced the winners in each of our road and gravel sub-categories.</p>\n<h3>Performance Road Bike of the Year – ENVE Melee Ultegra Di2</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Our Performance Road Bike of the Year for 2023: the ENVE Melee Ultegra Di2.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>We’ll be publishing the review of our Performance Road Bike of the Year, the ENVE Melee Ultegra Di2, on Monday 15 May, followed by full reviews of our contenders.</p>\n<h4>Performance Road Bike of the Year contenders</h4>\n<ul><li>Basso Diamante Ultegra Di2</li>\n<li>Cannondale Supersix Evo Hi-Mod 2</li>\n<li>Colnago V4Rs</li>\n<li>ENVE Melee Ultegra Di2</li>\n<li>Wilier 0 SL Rival AXS</li>\n</ul><section><div>\n        \n<h4>Meet the tester | Ashley Quinlan</h4>\n<p>BikeRadar’s senior technical editor, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/ashleyquinlan/\">Ashley Quinlan</a>, took charge of the performance category.</p>\n<p>Here, Ashley was looking for an all-round race bike that stood out from the increasing homogeny of a crowded market.
