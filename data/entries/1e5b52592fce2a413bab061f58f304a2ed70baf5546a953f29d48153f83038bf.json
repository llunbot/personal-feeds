I cannot, to paraphrase <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/apples-green-bubbles-targeted-by-doj-in-lawsuit-over-iphone-monopoly/\">the Apple CEO's litigation-influencing quip</a>, simply buy my spouse an iPhone. And a MacBook. And sell our household Chromebook. And give up entirely on Windows-based PC gaming.</p>\n<p>Instead, I've come to use two apps to send files between operating systems on the same Wi-Fi, whether they're systems from Cupertino, Redmond, Mountain View, or elsewhere. One is <a href=\"https://localsend.org/#/download\">LocalSend</a>, a cross-platform app with an <a href=\"https://github.com/localsend/localsend\">open source client</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/localsend/protocol\">protocol</a> that I install wherever I can. The other lower-friction tool that's especially handy for guests and rarely used devices is <a href=\"https://snapdrop.net/\">SnapDrop</a>, a website or web app you open on both devices and then send files through, entirely on your local network. It, too, has <a href=\"https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/\">its code out there for anybody to view</a>.</p>\n<p>Neither of these apps is new, which is good. They've been around long enough to garner good reviews and trust from their users. Beyond sharing files between two humans, I've also leaned on them when setting up headless systems or other quirky systems.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013441#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013441&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1e5b52592fce2a413bab061f58f304a2ed70baf5546a953f29d48153f83038bf","category":"Tech"}
