Inference refers to how large language models, the large data repositories that power apps like ChatGPT, respond to users’ queries. Chatbots and LLMs normally run in vast data centers with much greater computing power than an iPhone.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992550#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992550&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Financial Times","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"611419b5b7f51573395207c5d7bff55bfb9d8ab38a21e1b2dad16a6a9a4107fb","category":"Tech"}
