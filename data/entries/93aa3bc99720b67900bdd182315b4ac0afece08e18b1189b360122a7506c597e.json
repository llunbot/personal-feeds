The Company posted quarterly\nrevenue of $124.3 billion, up 4 percent year over year, and\nquarterly diluted earnings per share of $2.40, up 10 percent year\nover year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/01/apples-reports-record-revenue-for-q1-2025/\">Jason Snell (with his usual assortment of charts)</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Probably most notable is that iPhone revenue was down 1% from the\nyear-ago quarter, which will certainly upset some analysts and\ninvestors, given that the iPhone is more than half of Apple’s\ntotal revenue. But the Mac jumped 16%, the iPad was up 15%, and\nservices was up 14%. The recently sluggish Wearables, Home, and\nAccessories category was down 2%.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sales were down 11 percent in China companywide, which is surely what pulled the iPhone down. Outside China iPhone 16 sales must be very strong. But Apple’s overall sales in China <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/financials-2025-1-4-5-1.png?ssl=1\">have been trending down for 3 years now</a>. It looks to me like Apple might have peaked there around 2021 or 2022.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/30/aapl-q1-fy2025\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"93aa3bc99720b67900bdd182315b4ac0afece08e18b1189b360122a7506c597e","category":"Tech"}
