That title lies with the Pinarello Dogma X.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sister model to the more single-minded Dogma F, the Dogma X retains most of the road-ripping credentials of the WorldTour-winning race bike, while also building in plenty of features that enhance real-world rider experience, upping attributes such as comfort and practicality at no expense to performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pinarello Dogma X is the perfect example of the modern endurance category: bikes that accommodate outwardly competing features with no compromise.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rocketship ride </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Endurance bikes are typically associated with mid-level groupsets, affordable frame materials and so-so components, the prevailing wisdom being that comfort and durability require compromises when it comes to outright performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dogma X defies that convention. While it might not be a race bike, its DNA is directly inherited from its racing sibling, the Dogma F. The frame is made from a similar carbon fibre composite blend, including the premium T1100 carbon used in the Dogma F. As a result the Dogma X is plenty stiff but remains impressively light.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-164-2-647x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-164-2-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-164-2-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-164-2-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-164-2-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-164-2-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-164-2-1140x1710.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-164-2.webp 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It doesn’t get more accomplished than Shimano’s Dura-Ace Di2 groupset when it comes to reliable, smooth shifting and powerful braking – two key attributes for any endurance bike. The Dogma X has also been designed with Pinarello’s trademark approach to asymmetry, meaning that torsional forces from the drivetrain are countered by the rear triangle’s design, which is bolstered on the driveside.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Magic carpet comfort</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Comfort is the surprise calling card of the Dogma X and is achieved through a couple of clever design features. Its use of Pinarello’s more relaxed X-series geometry creates a slightly shorter reach and higher stack than the Italian manufacturer’s racy Dogma F, so the rider’s best on-bike position is more achievable and sustainable over long rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Added to that, longer chainstays add stability to a ride that’s had the chop dialled out of it by Pinarello’s unique X-Stays. This is a crisscrossed section of slim tubing at the top of the seatstays that Pinarello says absorbs road vibration while preserving lateral stiffness. That means the bike should accelerate just as keenly as the Dogma F but seated comfort should be much better over broken ground. That reengineered back end also affords 35mm of tyre clearance, letting riders make the most of the modern, wide road tyres to maximise grip and enhance the compliance generated by those seatstays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the rear of the bike is centred on comfort, and deviates in design from the Dogma F significantly, from the front you’d be hard-pressed to tell the two apart. The Dogma X adopts very similar tube profiles in its main triangle to ensure the F’s aero credentials largely remain intact and the rider will not only be comfortable, but fast as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Top-shelf componentry</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 groupset sets the tone for the rest of a bulletproof build. In support of the groupset’s high-end disc brakes and electronic shifting, Pinarello specs its in-house components brand Most’s Talon Ultra Light handlebar, Lynx Ultrafast Superflow carbon saddle and an aero-profiled seatpost that uses a 3D printed titanium seatclamp and bolts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Princeton CarbonWorks’ Grit 4540 wheels are light, but their generous internal dimensions will pair smoothly with the wide tyres the Dogma X encourages its rider to use. Not that they’d need to look past what is supplied as standard anyway, because Pirelli’s P Zero Race TLR 35mm tyres are an ideal option to get off and rolling straight away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• <strong><a href=\"http://www.pinarello.com/uk/en\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> for more information on the Pinarello Dogma X, and to find your nearest dealer</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/pinarello-focus-dogma-x\">Pinarello focus: Dogma X, the highest level of endurance</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"6ff396811a8bfd166020c364ed555ab1dcc666395cf410f7a71971170e9413af","category":"Cycling"}
