With now more than 7 years offering these types of bikes in the cycling industry, it is safe to say Panorama have accumulated a fair amount of expertise on the wide tire bike market. As such, the brand is very proud to announce its first titanium fat bike, designed to ride both in the summer and the winter thanks to a 2 Q-factor (the distance between the pedals) configuration.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/2024-TorngatTi-12a.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/2024-TorngatTi-12a.jpg?w=1920&amp;quality=75 1920w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/2024-TorngatTi-12a.jpg?resize=1024,768&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/2024-TorngatTi-12a.jpg?resize=768,576&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/2024-TorngatTi-12a.jpg?resize=1800,1350&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/2024-TorngatTi-12a.jpg?resize=1335,1001&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/2024-TorngatTi-12a.jpg?resize=700,525&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/2024-TorngatTi-12a.jpg?resize=1536,1152&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/MY23-fatbikes-3b-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/MY23-fatbikes-3b-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/MY23-fatbikes-3b-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,768&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/MY23-fatbikes-3b-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1500&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/MY23-fatbikes-3b-scaled.jpg?resize=768,576&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/MY23-fatbikes-3b-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1350&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/MY23-fatbikes-3b-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,1001&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/MY23-fatbikes-3b-scaled.jpg?resize=700,525&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/MY23-fatbikes-3b-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1152&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/MY23-fatbikes-3b-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1536&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/2024-TorngatTi.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/2024-TorngatTi.jpg?w=1920&amp;quality=75 1920w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/2024-TorngatTi.jpg?resize=1024,768&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/2024-TorngatTi.jpg?resize=768,576&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/2024-TorngatTi.jpg?resize=1800,1350&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/2024-TorngatTi.jpg?resize=1335,1001&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/2024-TorngatTi.jpg?resize=700,525&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/2024-TorngatTi.jpg?resize=1536,1152&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Based on the field experience of its clients, Panorama noticed that one of the biggest drawbacks from using this type of bike for longer rides or in the summer was the knee pain it could provoke due to the wide Q-factor. To cope with this problem,  Panorama designed its Torngat Ti frame with two possible configurations, i.e. two crankset axles of different length that will be provided with the bike. This combination makes the Torngat Ti very versatile, offering different types of use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As a regular fatbike with a standard fatbike crankset (205mm Q-factor) to fit the widest 27.5’’x4.5’’ tires on the market.</li>\n<li>As a fatbike with 27.5’’x4’’ tires and a more ergonomic Q-factor of 185mm.</li>\n<li>As a hardtail mountain bike or do-almost-anything bike with 27.5’’x4’’ or 29’’x3’’ tires and the 185 mm Q-factor crankset offering a comfortable pedaling stance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.panoramacycles.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Panorama Cycles</a></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/Donhou-Utility-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/Donhou-Utility-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/Donhou-Utility-2.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/Donhou-Utility-2.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/Donhou-Utility-2.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/Donhou-Utility-2.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/Donhou-Utility-2.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/Donhou-Utility-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://donhoubicycles.com/collections/bikes/products/utility?variant=41431334846650\" target=\"_blank\">Donhou Utility Complete Builds £1,825</a></h3>\n<p>One of our favorite bikes from last year’s Bespoked, the Donhou Utility, is now offered as a complete build for an excellent price.</p>\n<p>The Utility bike is optimized for speed, comfort, safety and front loading.
