No cable between the two devices will be necessary, so this is a function that improves the wireless connectivity between two devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAstropad Studio users can take advantage of peer-to-peer connectivity even when a WiFi connection is not available\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to Astropad, peer-to-peer functionality removes the uncertainties of WiFi for artists who rely on Astropad Studio, introducing smooth and low latency drawing. Peer-to-peer connectivity works with all Astropad Studio features, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> integration, touch gestures, shortcuts, and more. I\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPeer-to-peer is limited to Mac users and it is not available for those who use Astropad Studio with a PC. It requires an iOS device with iOS 13 or later and a Mac running macOS 10.15 or later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPeer-to-peer networking is a free update for all current Astropad Studio users. Astropad Studio is <a href=\"https://astropad.com/product/studio/\">priced at $99.99 per year</a>, with a 14-day free trial available for testing it out, but there is a 20 percent discount through May 19.
