Besides the Telangana facility, Foxconn reportedly plans to ramp up its investment in India with a view to manufacturing smartphones, EVs, and semiconductors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's not clear which model(s) of AirPods are included in Foxconn's order, but there's a high chance they will include a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/15/kuo-usb-c-apple-accessories/\">USB-C connector</a> instead of a Lightning connector, as Apple is rumored to be planning to introduce <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> models with a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port in 2023.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 3</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/\">India</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/16/foxconn-wins-airpods-order-india/\">Foxconn to Make AirPods for the First Time, New Factory Planned in India</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foxconn-to-make-airpods-for-the-first-time-new-factory-planned-in-india.2383855/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"84d0843a2a57154ce5ad7ab8da54209dcf1a43b418d5281a8c2eb0e66e667e1f","category":"Apple"}
