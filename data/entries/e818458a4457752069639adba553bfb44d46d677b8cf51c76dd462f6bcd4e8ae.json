He is using \"future releases\" and said it is \"changing [his] daily life.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is \"moving as fast as possible\" to bring ‌Apple Intelligence‌ to more countries \"while ensuring quality.\" As for R&amp;D, the level of intensity that Apple is putting into AI has \"increased a lot,\" with some existing resources allocated to the new technology as well.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone Sales</h2>\r<br />\nIt's no surprise that ‌iPhone‌ sales were up during the quarter, as the ‌iPhone 16‌ models launched in September. ‌iPhone‌ revenue was $46.2 billion, up from $43.8 billion in the year-ago quarter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCook said that ‌iPhone 16‌ sales in September 2024 were stronger than <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> sales in September 2023.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Mac and iPad Sales</h2>\r<br />\nMac and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> Sales were up, with the Mac coming in at $7.7 billion, up from $7.6 billion in Q4 2023, and ‌iPad‌ revenue at $7 billion, up eight percent from $6.4 billion last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Wearables</h2>\r<br />\nApple's wearables revenue fell this quarter, coming in at $9 billion, down three percent from $9.3 billion last year. Wearables revenue for fiscal 2024 was $37 billion, down from $39.9 billion in fiscal 2023.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThough wearables revenue was down, the Apple Watch install base reached a new all-time high, and more than half of customers who purchased an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Services</h2>\r<br />\nServices revenue was almost $25 billion during the quarter, up from $22.3 billion in Q4 2023, and a new all-time record. Fiscal 2024 services revenue was $95 billion, up from $90 billion in the year-ago quarter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPaid and transacting accounts reached a new all-time high, and paid accounts and paid subscriptions grew double digits year over year. Apple has more than 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on its platform, which is double what it had four years ago.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Next Quarter</h2>\r<br />\nFor the December quarter, Apple expects revenue to grow low to mid single digits year over year, with services revenue to grow double digits.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Farewell to Luca Maestri</h2>\r<br />\nThis is Apple's final earnings call with Maestri, who is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-cfo-luca-maestri-stepping-down/\">stepping down from his role</a> on January 1, 2025 to lead the Corporate Services teams. Kevan Parekh will take over as Chief Financial Officer, joining Apple's executive team.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDuring the earnings call, Cook thanked Maestri for his \"extraordinary service as Apple CFO,\" and said that during his 10 years in the role, Luca had done \"truly exceptional work in shaping Apple as we know it today.\" Maestri said that serving as Apple CFO has \"been a real privilege and an amazing journey.\"<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/31/apple-q4-2024-earnings-call-takeaways/\">Apple's Q4 2024 Earnings Call Takeaways</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-q4-2024-earnings-call-takeaways.2441651/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e818458a4457752069639adba553bfb44d46d677b8cf51c76dd462f6bcd4e8ae","category":"Apple"}
