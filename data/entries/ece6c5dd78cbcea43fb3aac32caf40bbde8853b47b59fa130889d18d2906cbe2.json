{"title":"iOS 15: How to Share Whatever's On Your Screen Using Siri","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/share-whats-on-iphone-screen-siri/","date":1627984671000,"content":"In <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, Apple has significantly improved <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> by adding some much-anticipated features like on-device processing and support for offline requests, while also making the voice assistant more context-aware.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/iOS-15-Siri-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nOne result of ‌Siri‌'s increased contextual awareness is its ability to help you share whatever's on your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> screen with someone else via a Message, be it a website in Safari, a song in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, a photo, or just the local weather forecast.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo share something at any time, say \"Hey ‌Siri‌,\" then \"Share this with [person].\" ‌Siri‌ will spring into action and confirm your request by asking \"Are you ready to send it?\" At that point, you can either say yes/no, or you can add a comment to the message using the input field and then hit Send.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/siri-share-ios-15.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIf it's something that can't be shared directly, like the weather forecast, ‌‌Siri‌‌ will take a screenshot and send that instead. All you have to do is say \"Share this with [person],\" and ‌‌Siri‌‌ will take the screenshot, then confirm the request with you in the same way.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/siri-share-ios-15-1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe feature works with ‌‌Apple Music‌‌, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/\">Apple News</a>, Maps, Safari web pages, photos, Messages, and more. When ‌iOS 15‌ is released in September, expect third-party apps to gain support for sharing via ‌Siri‌, too.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/share-whats-on-iphone-screen-siri/\">iOS 15: How to Share Whatever's On Your Screen Using Siri</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-15-how-to-share-whatevers-on-your-screen-using-siri.2306347/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GDdP_yzgYL0:yVz5jEc9_9Y:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GDdP_yzgYL0:yVz5jEc9_9Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/GDdP_yzgYL0\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ece6c5dd78cbcea43fb3aac32caf40bbde8853b47b59fa130889d18d2906cbe2","category":"Apple"}
