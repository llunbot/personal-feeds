For decades, IA crawlers have collected snapshots of the public Internet, making it easier to compare current versions of websites to historic versions. And IA also allows users to upload digital materials to further expand the web archive. Both aspects of the archive immediately proved useful to researchers assessing how much data the public risked losing during a rapid purge following a pair of President Trump's executive orders.</p>\n<p>Part of a small group of researchers who managed to download the entire CDC website within days, virologist Angela Rasmussen helped create a <a href=\"https://acasignups.net/archiveorg\">public resource</a> that combines CDC website information with <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/20250128-cdc-datasets\">deleted CDC datasets</a>. Those datasets, many of which were previously in the public domain for years, were uploaded to IA by an anonymous user, \"SheWhoExists,\" on January 31. Moving forward, Rasmussen told Ars that IA will likely remain a go-to tool for researchers attempting to closely monitor for any unexpected changes in access to public data.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/internet-archive-played-crucial-role-in-tracking-shady-cdc-data-removals/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/internet-archive-played-crucial-role-in-tracking-shady-cdc-data-removals/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"042bb4a416eb1db28b1e51689439eaca07330332744b1f04a0adaa3a32f47fb0","category":"Tech"}
