This buyer’s guide is our round-up of the best mountain bikes currently available between £500 and £750, as tested by BikeRadar.</p>\n<p>Budget is prioritised above all else when you’re sticking below <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-best-mountain-bikes-under-500/\" target=\"_blank\">£500 for a mountain bike</a>, while breaking <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bikes-under-1000-2/\" target=\"_blank\">the £1,000 mark</a> gives manufacturers a little more wiggle room to tailor frames to specific purposes and spec higher-quality components.</p>\n<p>At £750, you’re caught between managing your budget and keeping your expectations realistic. You’ll come across some nicer kit on bikes in this price range, but there may be only one or two standout components among a spec list that’s predominantly made up of basic parts.</p>\n<p>Don’t worry too much about compromising though, because manufacturers realise this is a price point that’s largely governed by budget.</p>\n<p>As such, they tend to focus their attention on producing a decent frame and pick components that will keep costs down, on the assumption that you’ll gradually upgrade them as they wear out over time.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Male cyclist riding silvery blue full suspension mountain bike through woods\" title=\"Vitus Nucleus 29 VR 04\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The best mountain bikes around the £750 mark are a perfect platform for upgrades.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton</i></span></div>\n<p>The trick, therefore, is to seek out a bike with a frame that’s best for you and use that as a platform on which to build. You can always upgrade parts when your riding has improved or you’ve got a bit of extra cash.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">Dropper posts</a> are becoming more common at this price too, as are <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-disc-brakes/\">hydraulic disc brakes</a> and Boost wheel spacing, which makes it easier to upgrade a mountain bike’s wheels. These are three things that previously were only really seen on more expensive mountain bikes.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to get fixated on finding the best fork, gears, brakes or wheel and tyre combination, but you also need to consider the sort of abuse the weather and landscape can inflict on them in a relatively short space of time – especially during winter.</p>\n<p>So, if you’re limited to £750, prioritise the chassis over the fancy baubles hanging off it. With that in mind, these are the best mountain bikes under £750 tested by us.</p>\n<h2>Best mountain bikes under £750 in 2023</h2>\n<h3>2022 Voodoo Bizango</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Voodoo Bizango hardtail trail mountain bike\" title=\"Voodoo Bizango - 01\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Voodoo Bizango is back for 2022 having undergone an overhaul last year.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £750 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Great trail-ready geometry</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Loads of upgrade potential</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The 2022 Voodoo Bizango is a truly great bike for the cash, scoring a rarely awarded full five stars.</p>\n<p>Matching a great frame with a competent spec package, this bike is very unlikely to leave budding riders wanting.</p>\n<p>For chronic upgraders, a dropper post would be a wise addition but even out of the box, the Bizango will not disappoint.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/2022-voodoo-bizango-review/\">Read our full 2022 Voodoo Bizango review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=71026X1519955&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fbikes%2Fmountain-bikes%2Fvoodoo-bizango-mens-mountain-bike---s-m-l-xl-frames-452670.html\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the 2022 Voodoo Bizango direct from Halfords</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Calibre Rake 29</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Calibre Rake 29 pack shot\" title=\"Calibre Rake 29 pack shot\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Rake 29 is well finished.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £700 (£550 with GO Outdoors membership card) as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Impressive spec;

The smallest sizes are specced with 27.5in wheels only.</p>\n<p>The tan wall tyres really stand out, complementing the overall look of the bike. The rest of the kit is fairly standard for the bike’s price point and although it performs well, isn’t exceptional.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Bobcat Trail 3’s spec and geometry make the bike well-suited to long days in the saddle with a focus on miles covered rather than metres descended on aggressive trails. A few key spec changes – such as the fork and tyres – would unlock more potential from the frame.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/marin-bobcat-trail-3-review/\">Read our full Marin Bobcat Trail 3 review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Pinnacle Kapur 3</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pinnacle Kapur 3\" title=\"Pinnacle Kapur 3\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> With its trail-friendly geometry, RockShox fork and Shimano brakes, the Kapur certainly looks the part.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr / Our Media</i></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £625 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Nippy; agile; fun</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> RockShox front fork</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Decked out with a RockShox fork, Shimano brakes and solid trail-focused geometry, the Kapur 3 would be a great first mountain bike because it’s an absolute joy to ride.</p>\n<p>Although the frame’s quite basic – think no internally routed cables, no port for a dropper post or fancy-shaped tubes – it does have two bottle cage mounts and great geometry for newbies to the sport.</p>\n<p>Its spec really stands out, though.

The short geometry doesn’t make riding on technical trails that easy and the front suspension is a bit sticky.</p>\n<p>It’s good for starting out and pootling about, but some riders might reach the limits of the Rockhopper’s capabilities fairly quickly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/specialized-rockhopper-comp-29-2x-review/\">Read our full Specialized Rockhopper Comp 29 2x review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Vitus Nucleus 29 VRS</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>3.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vitus Nucleus 29 VRS\" title=\"Vitus Nucleus 29 VRS\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Nucleus felt stiff on the descents.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £750 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Shimano Deore-based groupset; good grippy tyres</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Compromised geometry; fork and brake limitations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Nucleus 29 VRS comes from Chain Reaction’s in-house brand Vitus. As a result, it is well specced with a 10-speed Shimano Deore drivetrain, hydraulic disc brakes and 29in WTB wheels.</p>\n<p>The bike frame is built from lightweight and strong 6061-T6 aluminium and has externally routed cables for easy maintenance.</p>\n<p>The geometry is orientated more towards trail riding than downhill, and the ride is pretty harsh too, so you probably wouldn’t want to take it over any particularly rough or difficult downhill terrain anyway. The grippy tyres do compensate a little for the feel of the bike, though.</p>\n<p>What you’re getting with this bike is an excellent spec thanks to Chain Reaction’s buying power. If you can afford to, you might consider the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/vitus-sentier-27-review/\">Vitus Sentier 27</a> which delivers a more forgiving ride.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/vitus-nucleus-29-vrs-review/\">Read our full Vitus Nucleus 29 VRS review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<section>\n    <div>\n        \n<h2>Have you found what you’re looking for? </h2>\n<p>Could you stretch your budget a little further?
