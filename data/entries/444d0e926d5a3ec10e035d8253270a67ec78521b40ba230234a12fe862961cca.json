The Titanium All-Road frame combines the unmatched strength-to-weight ratio and lifelong durability that is inherent in titanium with carbon’s feathery weight, and steel’s stellar ride quality. It may be the perfect frame material.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-frame4.jpg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-frame4.jpg\" alt=\"State bicycle co titanium all road frame\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-frame4.jpg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-frame4-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-frame4-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-frame4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-frame4-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-frame4-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Crafted from the “highest quality” double-butted Gr9 3AL/2.5V titanium the Titanium All-Road was designed to conquer any terrain while ensuring a comfy, long-lasting experience. But perhaps most importantly, the Titanium All-Road bike from State is affordable with a complete bike price starting at just $2,499. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-Bicycle-Co-titanium-all-road-geometry.png\"><img width=\"640\" height=\"442\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-Bicycle-Co-titanium-all-road-geometry.png\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-Bicycle-Co-titanium-all-road-geometry.png 640w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-Bicycle-Co-titanium-all-road-geometry-297x205.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-Bicycle-Co-titanium-all-road-geometry-120x83.png 120w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Built with progressive geometry, the All-Road will be offered in five sizes from XS to XL. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that while this bike is called the All-Road, the tire clearance certainly makes it seem more like a gravel bike than what we’ve come to expect from all-road bikes. The frame is designed around 700c wheels with clearance for up to 53mm tires, which will also fit 650b x 2.2″ rubber. Complete bikes will ship with 700c x 47mm Vittoria Terreno Dry tires giving this “all-road” bike bigger stock tires than many gravel bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-11-1-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-11-1-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"State bicycle co titanium all road fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-11-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-11-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-11-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-11-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-11-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-11-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-11-1-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-12-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-12-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"State bicycle co titanium all road rear brake\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-12-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-12-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-12-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-12-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-12-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-12-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-12-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-28-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-28-1536x1024.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-28-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-28-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-28-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-28-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-28-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-28-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-28-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-27-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-27-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"State bicycle co titanium all road bottom bracket\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-27-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-27-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-27-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-27-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-27-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-27-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/State-bicycle-co-titanium-all-road-27-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The titanium frame utilizes a standard 68mm threaded BSA bottom bracket, and 100x12mm/142x12mm axles. Complete bikes include a ZS44/EC44 headset with ceramic bearings. Cable routing is internal with both frame and fork running flat mount brakes. It does not appear that the frame is dropper post-compatible. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a
