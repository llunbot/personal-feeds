Contec <a href=\"https://www.contec.com/solutions/energy/\">says</a> that roughly 30,000 power stations have introduced the devices, which come in various packages based on the size of the operation and the type of equipment it uses.</p>\n<p>Searches on Shodan indicate that more than 600 of them are reachable on the open Internet. As problematic as that configuration is, researchers from security firm VulnCheck <a href=\"https://vulncheck.com/blog/solarview-exploitation\">said Wednesday</a>, more than two-thirds of them have yet to install an update that patches <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29303\">CVE-2022-29303</a>, the tracking designation for a vulnerability with a severity rating of 9.8 out of 10. The flaw stems from the failure to neutralize potentially malicious elements included in user-supplied input, leading to remote attacks that execute malicious commands.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951780#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951780&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"19bf5514df6f11fdc75d65eabf210c3a2a1aada73f252d8c27458f29c8abb50f","category":"Tech"}
