It resides in the Web User Interface of Cisco IOS XE software when exposed to the Internet or untrusted networks. Any switch, router, or wireless LAN controller running IOS XE that has the HTTP or HTTPS Server feature enabled and exposed to the Internet is vulnerable. At the time this post went live, the Shodan search engine showed that as many as 80,000 Internet-connected devices could be affected.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976348#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976348&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f655ab17334d5d0c37ce0a10bc61848bc6eec8c659741b1d8c6881ec3264e7d5","category":"Tech"}
