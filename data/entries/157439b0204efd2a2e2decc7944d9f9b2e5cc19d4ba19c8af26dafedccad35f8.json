While there are ways to use a bike that stimulate the senses – take, for example, Danny Macaskill bouncing on his bike like a pogo stick in a gymnasium adapted for cyclo-acrobatics – those who pedal for hours on end by trade do not have the same party trick to deploy and invite viewers in with. Consequently, endurance cycling videography tends to feel like the world’s most extensive b-roll collections. It’s visual background noise that we tolerate.</p>\n<p>Cut to: A slightly haggard Australian man adorned with rave candy, cool tattoos, and a thousand yard stare that matches the scope of his ambitions. It’s Lachlan Morton. He’s won the hearts of cycling fans the world over with exploits that are a source of endless fascination and intrigue for a viewing public that extends beyond the confines of the cycling-obsessed. If this sport wants to transcend our limited market share and niche status outside of Europe, Lachlan is the subject du jour.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-20-at-10.14.27%E2%80%AFAM.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-20-at-10.14.27%E2%80%AFAM.png?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-20-at-10.14.27%E2%80%AFAM.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-20-at-10.14.27%E2%80%AFAM.png?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>A year ago,<em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYRKjKsDgyQ\" target=\"_blank\">The Divide</a></em>, a 50-minute film documenting Lachlan’s unimaginably fast run on the Tour Divide was released. I put on my patented “good time hat”* to watch it. During my viewing, I was caught by two threads. The first being, “Huh, they’re just independently producing a feature-length documentary.” This acknowledged feat allowed me to keep my hat on, put aside my fixations on the impulses I feel dominate the visual landscape of cycling for the worst, and watch in earnest.</p>\n<p><em>The Divide</em> succeeds when the camera breaks the veil that accusations of self-support impose. The choice to think beyond the confines of ultra-racing, as codified in comment threads, liberates the gaze of the lens from the logic of surveillance that constrains other ultra-endurance documentation efforts. In exchange for a result with an asterisk, viewers get to witness something much more rich and textured than high-resolution shots of endless expanses. They see a human, suffering, smiling, persevering, and performing for the camera up-close and in the flesh. Lachlan talks to us and we get to see and hear him from a vantage other than a telephoto lens, voice recorder, or fish-eye action camera.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-20-at-10.16.30%E2%80%AFAM.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-20-at-10.16.30%E2%80%AFAM.png?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-20-at-10.16.30%E2%80%AFAM.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-20-at-10.16.30%E2%80%AFAM.png?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This is a departure from the always lurking impersonal gaze that we encounter, say, someone like Lael Wilcox from in coverage and films of her runs at the Tour Divide. The tension is not a bubble between camera and subject waiting to be burst by a finish line or DNF. Lachlan acknowledges from the outset that bargaining with the powers that be in ultra-racing is a fool’s errand. His feat is enough to render the question inert. There is very little investment in the myth-making impulses that dominate the ultra-distance racing world. Probably because Lachlan is not of this world and the confidence to know he’s faster than everyone spares us from the more predictable trappings of a will-he-won’t-he yarn.</p>\n<p><em>The Divide</em> culminates with the thread that I desperately wanted more of: Lachlan’s blank expression sitting at the Antelope Wells border station, seemingly unphased at the reality of shattering the record he set out to best. It is a glimpse of the pathos I crave in sports cinema. The moment when an athlete is clearly reckoning with the unanswerable question of <em>why.</em> So many doors open for the narrative structure of these projects when looking beyond the challenge of a race or FKT and towards the racer themselves as the subject to be explored. A realization that makes apparent the ways that <em>The Divide</em> was still, in some ways, restrained. Lachlan set terms for his run that the camera and characters were not to breach.</p>\n<p><em>The Great Southern Country</em> is the logical progression of Lachlan’s ultra-distance antics. All pretense of self-support has been thrown out the window. It has become something other than bike racing, or ultra-endurance racing, as we know it. In fact, it is arguably something that isn’t done by a person wearing a World Tour racing team kit. Lachlan’s journey around Australia involves a support ecosystem: coach, wife, inflatable pool, soigneur, RV, and crowds of children cheering him on from their front lawns.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-5.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Compared to <em>The Divide</em>, It’s a sprawling landscape of subjects to interview and a slightly more constrained collection of environments to shoot from. More people means more interviews and a need to weave together this cast of characters. In the simplest terms, you have a hierarchy: Lachlan is our protagonist, occasionally interviewed, often seen. His support staff are our stable constants, narrating what’s happening and offering context. At the bottom of the hierarchy are our person-off-the-street interviews.</p>\n<p>These moments with passersby along the route provide interesting fodder and context for the scale and impact of the ride, but the one-off and in-passing nature ultimately causes them to feel a bit uneven. There is a sharp contrast between the musings of a guy on the side of the road in awe of Lachlan’s feat and an Aboriginal woman sharing words about her art and her relationship to this place. Both are interesting. The line about how sore one’s ass would be simply driving that long is great and memorable but it exists in the same narrative tool bucket as ‘auntie’ discussing her relationship to Darwin.</p>\n<p>The time spent with auntie is a small glimpse into an unexplored detour that could be a coherent and textured link to the <a href=\"https://aboriginalliteracyfoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Aboriginal Literacy Project</a> that this project is fundraising for. She says of the children she works with, “They’ll be really happy when they paint the canvas,” and her interview situates me in this unfamiliar place and pokes at a history and project that I want more of. Let us see those canvases! But we must acknowledge that Lachlan is moving at a blistering pace across Australia and reviewing a movie is about earnestly assessing the frames as they’ve been cut together and shared.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-25.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-25.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-25.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-25.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>About three-quarters of the way through, between bleeped-out expletives, Lachlan details being nearly killed by a careless lorry driver. The tone shifts, a staff member cries, the image containing the frame shrinks, and we cut to the well-worn but (personally) welcome home movies montage trope. It is the beginning of an attempt to make a mountain out of a molehill. But the home movies reel is tender and affecting, giving way to a later peek behind the veil, when Lachlan candidly asserts, “It’s just not for me, I don’t feel the need to risk my life just to get a record.” He shirks the mythos of a man against the elements, the clock, and himself. Lachlan is not a record-breaking machine pedaling towards death. He’s a man, gifted with the chance to explore the globe on his bike, asking you to reconsider what’s possible.</p>\n<p><em>The Great Southern Country</em> is a project that charts a clear progression in the filmmaking ambitions of Gus and Lachlan. The most compelling narrative threads: precarity, mortality, and the dreaded <em>why?</em> are developed further. Expanding the Lachlan Morton lore and inviting viewers into something more than just a bike ride. While Gus’s lens captures living spaces and vast expanses of Australia that are composed and framed with intention. Occasionally challenging my preconceived notions about the limits of the high resolution widescreen quasi-static exterior shot.</p>\n<p>The film asks for an hour and forty five minutes of your time. Its worthiness technically or stylistically is a consideration that is secondary to this piece. If you think that more things in cycling should be captured by independent filmmakers who are sincerely engaged with the sport and the characters who populate it, you should put your “good time hat” on and watch along.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Cycling is still beginning its turn away from competitions proper as the site where bike ‘racing’ is seen and celebrated. It’s a transition that action sports like skateboarding embraced well over a decade ago. Endurance cycling’s visual language beyond the confines of the race course proper is still coming to be. And, unlike the media landscape of the aughts where action sports filmmaking was born anew, filmmakers like Angus are faced with a wholly new economy of media consumption.</p>\n<p>A market-driven race to the floor of your attention span. A shameless embrace of what’s smooth, fast, and effortlessly rendered before our eyes. When the imperative of content reigns, what we see on our screens is frictionless and fleeting.</p>\n<p>Cycling’s narrative turn deserves friction and, if we want something better, the people embracing it deserve your criticism and your time.</p>\n<p><em>* The “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/o1G_qhFHw4Q?si=zZw7FV3-pDqN0-Ee&amp;t=3210\" target=\"_blank\">good time hat</a>” is a concept coined by Tim Rogers. Wearing the good time hat is a tool to help one engage sincerely with media and art. It is not to be confused with the sentiment “let people enjoy things.” The good time hat promotes a more impersonal and critical gaze, encouraging the wearer to consider questions like “How did they do that?” or “What potential constraint led to this?”</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-8.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Interview with the Filmmaker</h3>\n<p><em>EF and company tried to help facilitate an interview with Lachlan about the project, but it occurred to me that the actual supplement to this piece would be a conversation with the filmmaker – Gus Morton.</em></p>\n<p>Gus kindly responded to an out-of-the-blue message on Instagram and we arranged a time to chat just a few days later. Our conversation sprawled over an hour and a half while he indulged my questions about making <em>The Great Southern Country</em> and his relationship with filmmaking more broadly.</p>\n<p>A few hours after our conversation, Angus went above and beyond, emailing me thoughtful and direct responses to the questions that at times sent us both down rabbit holes. Below are his written answers along with a few portions of our conversation transcribed and edited for clarity.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-12.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Austin: The sports documentary is often shot from the vantage of an outsider looking in (Herzog on ski-flying, Kapadia on Aryton Senna). As Lachlan’s brother and a former professional cyclist, your work here is markedly not that. </strong><strong>How does your proximity to Lachlan and the subject matter more broadly help, and what challenges does it create?</strong></p>\n<p>Gus: To expand beyond what we spoke about already. It helps in the obvious ways – I have a sibling bond with Lachlan, so there is the privileged emotional vulnerability that comes with that connection. I also don’t need his approval, or to be on friendly terms with him, so I can perhaps push when others might not for fear of derailing the relationship.</p>\n<p>It hinders things for that same reason, he is my brother, first and foremost, and everything will always come second to that. That can and does certainly affect what we make.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-9.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-9.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>I have long lamented that the visual language of endurance cycling often feels like b-roll, but there were some shots and stills in this project that caught my eye. The pans at 1:02:27 – 1:35:58 in particular come to mind.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What are you drawing on to keep things dynamic? Is it a struggle? Was it liberating to have a pretty eclectic set of interiors to shoot in?</strong></p>\n<p>These are some of my favourite shots in the film. I absolutely love them because they very elegantly convey so much narrative and context. The challenge in covering an effort like Lachlan’s is making it relatable to an audience. How can you adequately convey the effort? You can’t, of course, but something as simple as showing a closed supermarket as he rides by gives the audience some context, a sense of time, which relays into scale. It also serves as a reminder that the world around the ride marches on, often in spite of what the subject is trying to achieve.</p>\n<p>To answer the second part of that question – It was liberating, and it was something we really did think about beforehand. Being Australian, of course, we had an idea of the types of settings we’d find ourselves in, but we knew the challenge would be that you can’t guarantee where you’re going to land for a scene. So my co-director Scott and I really worked on a strict visual approach for how we would capture different interiors in pre-production (things like how we would use and supplement practical lighting, types of framing, types of coverage, etc). That way we could deploy the different approaches depending on what came our way without having to scout or come up with a plan on the fly. Which was really helpful because after a couple of weeks you’re basically braindead.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-20.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-20.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>There’s no room for re-do’s when you’re shooting something like this. Your subject is always moving. I’m curious about the challenge of scouting, staging, and getting these shots on an always rolling set. How does this impact composing shots? Do you feel like any particularly effective or important moments slipped past you for one reason or another?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s a major challenge, and even more so on <em>GSC</em> than I anticipated. The long straight roads coupled with a landscape that has very little relief meant finding dynamic frames was a challenge. The roads were also really busy with large trucks, which heavily restricted shooting from a vehicle. I try to be methodical with my approach to this, and think in terms of what we might need to complete a sequence, what sort of coverage we may need to convey a particular story point, and then work backwards from there. Usually there is a tree, or a sign, or a piece of trash you can make something of. We try to keep relatively close to Lach, when we are working on a sequence so the scenery in a sequence of shots matches, jumping ahead a km or two, and then leaving him alone for several hours. The one thing I must say is that you have like 20 hours a day to find a few good shots, so the law of averages says eventually you have to find something usable. So many moments slip by, JFC, when I die a string of all the amazing moments I forgot to button on for will flash before my eyes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-6.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>I wrote about wanting more from your interview with auntie and it got me thinking about just how tricky the logistics for some of those interviews must have been. Were there any arcs, ideas, characters, etc. that got totally left on the cutting room floor?</strong></p>\n<p>These characters are my favourite part of the film. As we discussed today, they are all facets of the larger character of Australia, each parlaying a different bit of information. The film is seen from the crew’s point of view and so it was a conscious decision to meet these characters where they were standing (literally) and never to go beyond that – because that is the experience. Glimpses of intrigue before we charge off, mid-sentence, in pursuit of some “greater” thing. At the end of the day you cannot have it all, you cannot set a world record and enjoy the company of a nation of strangers. You’re going to have to choose one.</p>\n<p><strong>It seems like you’ve found a really effective lane for independent filmmaking here. Is there much, if any, tension between you and the sponsors/financiers of these projects? Do they trust you to execute a vision? Will they sign off on getting weird with it at times?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m incredibly fortunate for the support I get from the team at EF. I cannot imagine what kinda lengths they are going to internally to protect us, but they do and that is really something special. As I said today, if Lachy is giving so much to the effort, I need to meet that with my own effort, I want to constantly be pushing my boundary in one element or another, and everyone at EF understands and supports that.</p>\n<p><strong>How does EF quantify whether or not these projects are a “success”?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m not sure, honestly. It seems to hit the goal, seems to hit the target, but I’m not sure. I don’t know, it’s funny, I actually just had this realization yesterday. I was talking to a friend and I was like, ‘For the last, whatever, five years, I’ve worked in advertising, essentially, right?’</p>\n<p>Like <em>Great Southern Country</em> is a branded product, you know, there is a public-facing sort of company that has a certain motive for this product, and we have a lot of freedom in that space. But for someone in that commercial world, I have no understanding of how it works or like what any of these metrics are, like any of that s**t.</p>\n<p>In the last month I’ve kind of stuck my head up for air. I’m trying to learn what the industry is doing. What is actually happening in this world? Because everything seems to be getting shorter and there is this demand for like 15-second spots and we just keep making our s**t longer and more fully formed and making sure that it is available for free and it’s doing better and better. So there is a funny counter trend, I guess, to what we’re making.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-7.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Are you submitting these projects to film fests?</strong></p>\n<p>No, no, no..</p>\n<p>About 10 or 11 years ago, we made a film called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqoKsDBQCTY\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Thereabouts</em></a>. It was born out of and with Scott Mitchell and Lachy’s experience in the cycling world and how being a professional athlete meant you had to curtail all of these parts of your personality.</p>\n<p>My very short experience is as a director in television in Australia with Scott [Mitchell] as a producer. There was a certain level of quality, whether it was the framing or the quality of audio, that a shot or a moment would have to pass in order to sort of like be deemed acceptable for television. And I just remember working on this long form doc for the ABC in Australia, and all of these really amazing moments would happen, like half on mic or the camera would be sort of panning and out of focus, and we wouldn’t be able to use them.</p>\n<p>I just remember being like, ‘But those were the most real bits!’ As someone watching every single second of footage that was shot, like, those were the best bits and we can’t put them in like, what? What the hell?</p>\n<p>So we went and made this film. It was like, we’re going to do this how we want so we’re going to include all of the s**t that’s not meant to be on camera. Like that was an intentional choice to include the reality of making the film. Sort of dissolve that fourth wall but include all of the s****y, real stuff. And we were just going to put it out for free. We weren’t going to go and do the film festival route because that ties your film up from being viewed by the public for so long, it loses its relevance or whatever.</p>\n<p>Making that film was a watershed moment for me because I was like, oh, thanks to the internet there is a way to go and make these things completely in your image or in an image that you decide and [from there] put it out and people can watch it, resonate with it, and respond to it. There’s a direct line to an audience and at the end of the day you’re like, that’s why you make these things, so people can watch them.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-10.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-10.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>What is the next step for you in terms of scope and audience with these projects? Are you laying the groundwork for a cycling documentary that reaches an even more mainstream audience?</strong></p>\n<p>Honestly, a rest. It’s been a very busy couple of years and I want to make sure I can bring something new to each project, and if I were to jump straight into another cycling thing right now I don’t think I could do that. I have a few things beyond the world of sport that I’m interested in exploring, but also, I’m kinda happy just to hang out with my partner and get a life.</p>\n<p><strong>The difficult thing about our media platforms is that they don’t really foster a culture of criticism. </strong><strong>Abstract metrics like views or engagement determine value and people aren’t necessarily encouraged to say “I like that” or “I didn’t like that for XYZ reason”.</strong></p>\n<p>It is, um, it’s deceit. And not only that, but it’s eroding the very form of media that most of these people who are measuring this s**t are trying to leverage for money. Eventually, we will just stop watching. Because, like, our instincts would tell us to not even engage and they will have killed an art form.</p>\n<p>The point of watching these things – any form of art, as you just said – I hesitate to say what the point of it is, but whatever, part of the exercise is that you do have to think about it. You do actually have to think about what you’re doing. And I’m not saying that all of it has to be that, I definitely watch stuff to tune out, but there is an element of engagement with it. It’s not asking you to ponder your existence necessarily or anything of that magnitude, but you do have to engage with it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-24.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-24.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-24.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-24.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>And I don’t think a conscious audience, which is all of us, like at one point or another are unwilling to do that. They want to because it’s fun. It’s satisfying. To have an opinion, to have a take. And so I think it’s sort of worrying when, you know, we let data dictate what form our storytelling should take too heavily because, I fear that it’s just operating off of a subconscious measurement; the audience isn’t even engaging, really. They’re just sort of … there.</p>\n<p>And because of that, it just erodes the quality of work, which the audience isn’t asking for! They’re not asking for you to do that. They’re literally not even really thinking about it until something pops up that asks you to engage with it.</p>\n<p>That’s why I think these films work. Because there’s time taken to make them, to position them, build hype, build an audience. And then, because of all of that, the audience goes, “You know what, I am going to take time to watch this because what the f**k else am I going to do?” You know, like for this one day I’m going to watch this two hours. We’re all capable of it, you know?</p>\n<p>It’s this funny thing where it’s like, “Oh, people won’t watch that.” Like, what? People have done some pretty f*****g crazy things, you know? Spending two hours watching something is not really up there with, like, you know any of that. So I’m pretty sure we’re capable of it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-16.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Great_Southern_Country_Review-16.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>What cycling or more sport related media in general is interesting or a source of inspiration for you right now? What non-cycling works are you drawing on and finding generative?</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t watch any cycling films at all, nor do I watch a lot of documentaries. I probably should. Occasionally I’ll binge just to see what everyone else is doing, but mostly I avoid it. I really enjoy fiction and watch a lot of it. I try to go to the cinema at least once a week, when I’m not on a job. I’ve been watching a lot of body horror at the moment for some reason.</p>\n<p><strong>We’re having this conversation because of<em> The Great Southern Country</em>, but I saw you also have another project you’re also promoting at the moment?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, it’s about the Colorado River, and the synopsis is like, using human powered movement to engage with people and places that are representative of a global issue.</p>\n<p>There’s a water crisis, the upcoming River compact, where they’re renegotiating basically the law of the river and the rights to the water. So we did a six-part series where we went from the mouth of the river to the headwater. We went upstream cycling, and we floated and climbed, and it was a long time in the making.</p>\n<p>I think it took us about five years to get that across the line. So that was a big milestone. It actually came out in, I think October or November last year, but it’s sort of been trickling out. I’ve been plugging it more recently because I finished <em>Great Southern Country</em> and I’m like, oh, I should push this other thing that we made which, like, nearly killed me. Like, someone needs to watch this because it was like the worst experience ever. Someone needs to just watch it so that I can at least feel like it was worth it.</p>\n<p><em>If you managed to make it to the end of this article without watching Gus Morton’s recent documentaries, what are you waiting for?
