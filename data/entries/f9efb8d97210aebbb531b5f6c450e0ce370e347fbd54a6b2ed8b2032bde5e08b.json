Stars David Tennant and Michael Sheen were perfectly cast as a demon and angel joining forces to avert Armageddon. But is it possible to recapture that magic in a second season, especially when it was originally meant to be a six-part <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Omens_(TV_series)\">limited series</a>?

They've come to be <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/03/war-is-brewing-between-heaven-and-hell-in-latest-trailer-for-good-omens/\">rather fond of the Earth</a> and all its humans with their many foibles, you see—not to mention the perks that come with our big blue orb, like sleek electronics and quaint little restaurants where they know you. The supernatural pair doesn't really want the Antichrist—an 11-year-old boy named Adam (Sam Taylor Buck) who has grown up unaware of his pivotal role in the coming apocalypse—to bring an end to all of that. </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1945941#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1945941&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f9efb8d97210aebbb531b5f6c450e0ce370e347fbd54a6b2ed8b2032bde5e08b","category":"Tech"}
