Now it seems as though we have a date—and we’ll only need to wait a little longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.ithome.com/0/756/324.htm&amp;xcust=1-1-2269510-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese-language site IT Home</a> (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/new-ipads-march-26-launch-date-rumor/&amp;xcust=1-1-2269510-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">via Macrumors</a>), Apple will take the wraps off its new iPads on Tuesday, March 26, based on an analysis of several tablet-related accessories that are due to go live on Amazon. It’s not clear which models will launch first or whether there will be a short preorder period. A separate report from <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/dsccross/status/1769761878530531405&amp;xcust=1-1-2269510-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Display Supply Chain Consultant Ross Young</a> claims that supplies of the 11-inch models could be more constrained than the larger 12.9-inch models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, a rumor from <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/new-ipad-air-shipping-from-china/&amp;xcust=1-1-2269510-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Weibo user Instant Digital</a> says the first round of iPad Air manufacturing has wrapped up and units are already shipping from China.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to update both the iPad Air and the iPad Pro with the first new models in more than a year. The most notable update will be a completely new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110304/ipad-air-2024-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html\">12.9-inch iPad Air model</a> as a cheaper alternative to the flagship iPad Pro. It’s also expected to get a better camera and processor. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/2024-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">iPad Pro</a> is rumored to get OLED displays, an M3 processor, and a thinner design as well as a higher price tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also rumored are new 11-inch and 12.9-inch Magic Keyboards that will presumably support both models of Air and Pro. Reports have said the new keyboards will be sturdier and more MacBook-like. A new Apple Pencil is also likely to launch to refresh the lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the iPad launches, Apple’s next event is likely to be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC</a> in June, which should be announced next week. Apple will unveil <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-ai-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, macOS 15, and new versions of the rest of its operating systems.
