It often doesn’t take long for those ideas to become something that makes someone money. </p><p>And then sometimes we come across tech that exists purely because it can, even when it makes no sense. This <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/is-this-playstation-sram-and-di2-mashup-the-ultimate-mechanics-hack/\" target=\"_blank\">old Playstation remote and Di2 shifter mash-up</a> is one such example. And you can add Japan-based maker Ryoichi Inoue to the list of tech-minded heroes making somewhat pointless things simply because their impressive skillset allows them to.</p><p>While Inoue’s creations aren’t anything that solve a problem or fulfil a wish, we still can’t help but be impressed by them.  </p><p>Inoue recently posted a few of his joyful creations on the CyclingTips Forum. From an <a href=\"https://forum.cyclingtips.com/t/retro-electric-down-tube-shifters/3344\" target=\"_blank\">electronic Campagnolo down tube shifter</a>, to <a href=\"https://forum.cyclingtips.com/t/a-derailleur-that-does-not-have-a-parallelogram/3372\" target=\"_blank\">a homemade rear derailleur without the usual parallelogram</a>, to the simply brilliant <a href=\"https://forum.cyclingtips.com/t/do-you-like-manual-shifts-in-cars/3367\" target=\"_blank\">mini H-pattern electronic gear shifter</a>, we thought these creations were well worth sharing further.</p><h2>H-pattern shifter for eTap and Di2 </h2><p>Ever wanted your derailleurs controlled by the experience of shifting through a manual gearbox? Yeah, me neither, but that didn’t stop Inoue from creating such a thing. </p><p>Based on a similar component to that used for the analog joystick in a Sony Playstation controller, Inoue has successfully made this mini H-pattern shifter work with both <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJb56LxaYw\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano Di2</a> and SRAM eTap derailleurs. </p><figure><p></p></figure><p>The design allows you to make one shift at a time or slam the derailleur from one extreme to the other. Front shifting is programmed to work by shifting the same gear twice.</p><p>No clutch is required. Just don’t sweat on it – it’s not waterproof.  </p><h2>Electronic down tube shifter </h2><p>Back in 2017 SRAM posted an April Fool’s joke about a wireless down tube shifter, and so of course Inoue created something real. </p><p>The hacked Campagnolo shifter drives a 10-speed Campagnolo Centaur rear derailleur that Inoue has fitted with a servo motor. This is a wired setup and appears to work quite well – even if the whole idea is hilarious.</p><figure><p></p></figure><p>Inoue previously made a similar setup from a Shimano Di2 climbing shifter, something that was apparently far easier to make. </p><h2> Homemade rear derailleur </h2><p>And for those who prefer their derailleurs to move based on cable tension, Inoue created one with a geared mechanism versus the common parallelogram design of today. </p><figure><p></p></figure><p>Inoue claims to have arrived at the interesting design himself but subsequently found out that other derailleurs have used similar designs, including FSA’s K-Force WE electronic derailleur. Either way, it’s an impressive example of a homemade item! </p></div></div>","author":"Dave Rome","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"55ea6038038b2ce6ac0d338236bf94d59d69e8a4eccb32866e0d47bf0083b8d9","category":"Cycling"}
