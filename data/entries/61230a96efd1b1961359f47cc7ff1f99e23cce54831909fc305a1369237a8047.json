Although galactic winds have already been observed in several nearby galaxies, a team of scientists has now made the first direct observations of this phenomenon in a large population of galaxies in the distant Universe, at a time when galaxies are in their early stages of formation.</p>\n<h2>Feedback</h2>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06718-w\">study’s</a> lead author, Yucheng Guo, of the Centre de Recherche Astrophysique de Lyon, galactic winds are an important part of the galaxy evolution models.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992614#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992614&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"61230a96efd1b1961359f47cc7ff1f99e23cce54831909fc305a1369237a8047","category":"Tech"}
