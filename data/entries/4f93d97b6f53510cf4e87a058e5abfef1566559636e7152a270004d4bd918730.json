He said Apple allegedly planned to include the cables with Apple silicon Macs, but the cables have never been released in these exact shades.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iMac-Cables-StellaFudge.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" /><em>Image Credit: @StellaFudge</em></div>\r<br />\n\"They're darker, more vibrant, and the normally white plastic has a matching color tint,\" he said.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven the cables have a Lightning connector, that means they would have been included with iMac models with the M1 chip or M3 chip, if they are authentic. The latest iMac with the M4 chip comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable for use with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-usb-c-magic-accessories/\">the new USB-C Magic accessories</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe wording of the social media post makes it sound like these cables were designed by Apple, and ultimately never released, but there is a possibility that they could be knockoff cables created by a third party. A <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/iphone-15-could-come-with-color-matched-cables/\">similar photo of colorful USB-C cables</a> surfaced last year, but the rumor that they would be included with iPhone 15 models proved to be inaccurate. It is possible that those cables were counterfeit too, but we cannot say for sure.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has included color-matching cables with the iMac since the M1 model launched in 2021, but they have brighter, pastel colors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nConsidering that Apple never released these deeper-colored cables, at best, or they are knockoffs, at worst, their existence does not really mean too much in the end. However, it's a fun look at something that might have been.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n@StellaFudge has also shared various unreleased Apple Watch bands in the past.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Unreleased colorways of color-matched Lightning cables included with Apple Silicon iMacs.
