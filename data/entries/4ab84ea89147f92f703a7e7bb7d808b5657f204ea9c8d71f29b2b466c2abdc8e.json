There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light; a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we're going to take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder.</em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Good morning. It is October 24, and today's image features an amazing shot of the Moon over a sanctuary in Sicily. It was captured by <a href=\"https://www.dariogiannobile.com/biography\">Dario Giannobile</a>, a talented Italian astrophotographer.</p>\n<p>This is a brilliant shot of the Moon, with the light from Earth shining on about 75 percent of the lunar surface and the remainder brightly lit by the Sun. The Moon is seen above the Santuario della Madonna Nera (Sanctuary of the Black Madonna) in Tindari, a small town on the northern coast of Sicily.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978104#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978104&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4ab84ea89147f92f703a7e7bb7d808b5657f204ea9c8d71f29b2b466c2abdc8e","category":"Tech"}
