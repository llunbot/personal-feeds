Rolling out new models may help the company get there, but you know what else helps? <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/googles-new-experimental-gemini-2-5-model-rolls-out-to-free-users/\">Giving away</a> premium features for free. Google has announced today that it's giving all US college students free access to Gemini Advanced, and not just for a month or twoâ€”the offer is good for a full year of service.</p>\n<p>With Gemini Advanced, you get access to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/google-says-the-new-gemini-2-5-pro-model-is-its-smartest-ai-yet/\">more capable Pro models</a>, as well as unlimited use of the Deep Research tool based on it. Subscribers also get a smattering of other AI tools, like the Veo 2 video generator, NotebookLM, and Gemini Live. The offer is for the Google One AI Premium plan, so it includes more than premium AI models, like Gemini features in Google Drive and 2TB of Drive storage.</p>\n<p>Google has a <a href=\"http://gemini.google/students\">new landing page</a> for the deal, allowing eligible students to sign up for their free Google One AI Premium plan. The offer is valid from now until June 30. Anyone who takes Google up on it will enjoy the free plan through spring 2026. The company hasn't specified an end date, but we would wager it will be June of next year. Google's intention is to give students an entire school year of Gemini Advanced from now through finals next year. At the end of the term, you can bet Google will try to convert students to paying subscribers.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/google-is-gifting-a-year-of-gemini-advanced-to-every-college-student-in-the-us/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/google-is-gifting-a-year-of-gemini-advanced-to-every-college-student-in-the-us/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"009d48fdbf2c64974d5c832476c49999d92304dbf4d4805683e0535ff7bbe9a1","category":"Tech"}
