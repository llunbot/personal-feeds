Such games served not just as athletic events but also religious ones that often involved ritual sacrifices. Archaeologists have now found evidence that the Maya may have blessed newly constructed ball courts in rituals involving plants with hallucinogenic properties, according to a <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301497\">new paper</a> published in the journal PLoS ONE.</p>\n<p>“When they erected a new building, they asked the goodwill of the gods to protect the people inhabiting it,” <a href=\"https://www.uc.edu/news/articles/2024/04/uc-researchers-find-evidence-of-ceremonial-offerings-in-mexico.html\">said co-author David Lentz</a> of the University of Cincinnati. “Some people call it an ensouling ritual, to get a blessing from and appease the gods.” Lentz and his team <a href=\"https://www.uc.edu/news/articles/2022/06/ancient-maya-used-sustainable-farming-forestry-for-millennia.html\">previously used</a> genetic and pollen analyses of the wild and cultivated plants found in the ancient Maya city Yaxnohcah in what is now Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2022.868033/full\">revealing evidence</a> of sustainable agriculture and forestry spanning a millennia.</p>\n<p>As we've <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/06/ancient-egyptian-followers-of-a-deity-called-bes-may-have-used-hallucinogens/\">reported previously</a>, there is ample evidence that humans in many cultures throughout history used various hallucinogenic substances in religious ceremonies or shamanic rituals. That includes not just ancient Egypt but also ancient Greek, Vedic, Maya, Inca, and Aztec cultures. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urarina\">Urarina</a> people who live in the Peruvian Amazon Basin still use a psychoactive brew called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca\">ayahuasca</a> in their rituals, and Westerners seeking their own brand of enlightenment have also been known to participate.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020387#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020387&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7e87d0f5ee421d6108a245a9b86bc49e5da432d8c87aee8d7e34c8018cc1307d","category":"Tech"}
