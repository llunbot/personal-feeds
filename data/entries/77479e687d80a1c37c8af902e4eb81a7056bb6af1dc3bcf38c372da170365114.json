Satechi is also including its <a href=\"https://satechi.net/products/6-port-gan-charger\">200W USB-C 6-Port GaN Charger</a> and a <a href=\"https://satechi.net/products/usb4-pro-cable-1-2m\">USB4 Pro Cable</a> to provide a full Mac accessory setup for the winner.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/dual-dock-stand-2.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nSatechi's <a href=\"https://satechi.net/products/dual-dock-stand-docking-station-with-nvme-ssd-enclosure\">Dual Dock Stand</a> is a docking station that includes an NVMe SSD Enclosure, allowing Mac owners to have a convenient array of ports and access to extra storage. The SSD enclosure that's at the bottom of the dock works with NVMe and SATA SSDs, so users can add in an SSD they may already have on hand.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTransfer speeds up to 10Gb/s are supported, and adding the SSD to the dock is as simple as unscrewing it, popping the SSD in, and putting the cover back on. The necessary screws and screwdriver are included.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlong with an SSD enclosure, the Dual Dock Stand features two HDMI ports and one DisplayPort to connect up to two 4K 60Hz displays. While two displays are supported, Macs with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> chips are limited to one external display. There's a USB-C power port that provides up to 75W power delivery for charging a connected Mac, plus there are two USB-C data ports (one 5Gb/s and one 10Gb/s), two USB-A ports, and an Ethernet port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/dual-dock-stand-3.jpg\" alt width=\"1488\" height=\"837\" />\r<br />\nThe dock itself is made from a space gray aluminum with black accents, and it matches well with Apple's hardware. The docking station is designed to fit underneath a MacBook Pro or ‌MacBook Air‌, offering an elevated angle that improves the ergonomics of the display. Satechi says the slight angled lift provides heat dissipation through strategically placed vents.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/satechi-dual-docking-station-5.jpg\" alt width=\"4000\" height=\"3000\" />\r<br />\nFor those who need a dedicated charger for a Mac and other devices, Satechi has a <a href=\"https://satechi.net/products/6-port-gan-charger\">200W 6-Port USB-C Charger</a>, which is priced at $150. It uses GaN technology for a compact size, and offers multiple charging configurations depending on the devices that you're charging up. There are two USB-C PD 3.1 ports that charge at up to 140W, and four USB-C PD 3.0 ports that charge up to 100W. One device can be charged at the full 140W, but if all six ports are in use, power is divided into 65W, 45W, 20W, 20W, 20W, and 20W.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/dual-dock-stand-1.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nTo connect the Dock or Charger to a Mac, Satechi has a 1.2M <a href=\"https://satechi.net/products/usb4-pro-cable-1-2m\">USB4 Pro Cable</a>, priced at $30. It supports 240W Power Delivery, 40Gb/s data transfer, and up to 8K resolution for external monitors. It has a braided design for durability, and is universally compatible with Thunderbolt and older USB versions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/satechi-cable.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1079\" />\r<br />\nFor those interested in Satechi's <a href=\"https://satechi.net/products/dual-dock-stand-docking-station-with-nvme-ssd-enclosure\">Dual Dock Stand</a>, Satechi is offering a 20 percent discount off of the $150 price tag with the promo code NVME20.
