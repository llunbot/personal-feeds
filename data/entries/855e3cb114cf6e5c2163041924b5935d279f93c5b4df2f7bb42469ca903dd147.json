People may receive up to $14 in May if their ISP opted into offering a partial discount during the program's final month. After that there will be no financial help for the 23 million households enrolled in the program.</p>\n<p>\"Additional funding from Congress is the only near-term solution for keeping the ACP going,\" FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/document/chairwoman-final-update-congress-affordable-connectivity-program-0\">letter</a> to members of Congress today. \"If additional funding is not promptly appropriated, the one in six households nationwide that rely on this program will face rising bills and increasing disconnection. In fact, according to our survey of ACP beneficiaries, 77 percent of participating households report that losing this benefit would disrupt their service by making them change their plan or lead to them dropping Internet service entirely.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021148#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021148&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"855e3cb114cf6e5c2163041924b5935d279f93c5b4df2f7bb42469ca903dd147","category":"Tech"}
