(credit: Avenir Telecom)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Four years ago, Avenir Telecom made headlines with an \"Energizer\"-branded phone that sported a massive <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/02/energizers-beastly-smartphone-has-an-18000mah-battery/\">18,000 mAh battery</a>. This year, the company is back at Mobile World Congress with another pocket-busting brick phone with an even bigger battery: 28,000 mAh.</p>\n<p>The phone is called the Energizer Hard Case P28K. Avenir Telecom doesn't seem to have a webpage or press release about it, and there is only one official picture, but <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/25/24082954/avenir-telecom-energizer-hard-case-p28k-28000mah-smartphone\">The Verge</a> saw the phone at the show. Avenir is not reaching these massive battery sizes through any kind of magic; the old 18,000 mAh phone was 18 mm thick, and this 28,000 mAh phone is a whopping 27.8 mm thick. That's more than three iPhones stacked on top of each other. It's more like a battery bank with a phone attached to it. Actually, there's a good chance this is a row of 18-mm-thick 18,650 batteries, plus normal 9-mm-thick smartphone hardware on top. The 570 g weight makes it more than three times the weight of an iPhone, too.</p>\n<p>The Energizer battery brand is not well-known for working with phones, but Avenir Telecom licenses the brand and pumps out all sorts of weird niche phones under the name. Lately, it has been making <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/results.php3?nYearMin=2020&amp;nYearMax=2023&amp;sMakers=106\">dumbphones</a>. This one is a ruggedized IP69 smartphone with big rubber bumpers. On top of that giant battery, you'll find a pretty crusty budget phone. The display is a 6.78-inch 1080p LCD. The SoC is a MediaTek MT6789, aka the <a href=\"https://www.mediatek.com/products/smartphones-2/mediatek-helio-g99\">Helio G99</a>—that's a 6 nm, eight-core SoC with two cortex A76 CPUs and six A55 CPUs, and it's 4G-only. You'd be hard-pressed to find a slower chip shipping in new phones. It also has 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, Android 14, and 33 W charging.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005867#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005867&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3801253efb9edfbbb0d63b640841cd3882d7c824001fb42b340dd4226f67a0df","category":"Tech"}
