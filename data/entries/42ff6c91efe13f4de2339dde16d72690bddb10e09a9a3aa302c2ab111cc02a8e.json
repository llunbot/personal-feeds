{"title":"First Look: Ventum GS1 Gravel Race Bike—More Aero, More Clearance, Less Weight","link":"https://bikerumor.com/ventum-gs1-gravel-bike-first-look/","date":1748449930000,"content":"<p><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-smoke-and-drift--jpg.webp\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" alt=\"Ventum GS1 smoke and drift\" /></p>\n<p>The new Ventum GS1 (<em>which we noticed at the<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/spotted-updated-ventum-gs1-gravel-bik/\"> 2025 Sea Otter Classic</a></em>) is finally ready to hit the gravel. Our speculations didn’t fall far from the actual offerings. However, after seeing all the information, a few surprises emerged. The updated geometry surprised us (having loved the current offering)… but we’ve yet to ride the new model, so I’ll reserve judgment.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-levers--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"8640\" height=\"5760\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-levers--jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ventum GS1 levers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-levers--jpg.webp 8640w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-levers--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-levers--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-levers--768x512.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(All Images: Ventum)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now in its third generation, the new GS1 Ventum looks leaner, meaner, and purpose-built for the demands of modern gravel racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-headtube--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"8640\" height=\"5760\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-headtube--jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ventum GS1 headtube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-headtube--jpg.webp 8640w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-headtube--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-headtube--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-headtube--768x512.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lighter, Stiffer, Faster</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s talk numbers—because Ventum brought receipts. The updated GS1 frame is 150g lighter than the outgoing version, thanks to a new high-modulus carbon layup and tube shaping. The top tube and dropped seat stay shapes are notably thinner. But weight savings didn’t come at the expense of ride quality. Ventum claims frame stiffness is <em>up</em> where it counts: 12% stiffer at the head tube, 8% stiffer at the bottom bracket, and 8% more vertically compliant out back – we’re guessing from those thinner stays.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-climbing--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"10328\" height=\"6885\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-climbing--jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ventum GS1 climbing\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bigger Tire Clearance, Snappy Geo</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new GS1 is aligning with others in the gravel space. The updated design offers a wider clearance of 700c x 56mm (2.2″) tire up front and a 700c x 50mm (2.0″) in the rear—that’s MTB rubber territory, right where the trend is. However, instead of slackening the front end or stretching the chainstays as many do, Ventum adhered to their 420mm rear center and signature Ventum Race Geometry, maintaining a tight, fast, and responsive feel. We’re thrilled to hear that, as we thoroughly enjoyed our time on the<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/updated-ventum-gs1-review-gravel-race-bike/\"> last iteration of the GS1</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-rival-rear--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1708\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-rival-rear--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Ventum GS1 rival rear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-rival-rear--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-rival-rear--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-rival-rear--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-rival-rear--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-rival-rear--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-rival-rear--2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-rival-rear--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-rival-rear--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They pulled this off with deep-drop seatstays that open the door for meaty tires without dulling the bike’s agility. It’s a sleek piece of engineering that preserves the race DNA while enhancing capability in rough terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-front-rider--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"8640\" height=\"5760\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-front-rider--jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ventum GS1 front rider\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-front-rider--jpg.webp 8640w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-front-rider--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-front-rider--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-front-rider--768x512.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>All-New Aero Front End</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Borrowing inspiration from their Tempus TT bike, the GS1’s front end is designed to slice through the wind. The new hourglass-shaped head tube tapers into a revised fork with airfoil shaping, improving airflow across the frame and rider. It’s subtle but effective—and yeah, aero <em>does</em> matter when you’re hammering across the flats or fighting a crosswind solo.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-RED-XPLR-side-front--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"7767\" height=\"5181\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-RED-XPLR-side-front--jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ventum GS1 RED XPLR side front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-RED-XPLR-side-front--jpg.webp 7767w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-RED-XPLR-side-front--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-RED-XPLR-side-front--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-RED-XPLR-side-front--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-RED-XPLR-side-front--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-RED-XPLR-side-front--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-RED-XPLR-side-front--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new carbon fork also gets a bump in clearance, now capable of clearing a true 2.25″ (57mm) tire while staying stiffer and lighter than the previous design. That’s a win on both the control and weight fronts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1x Optimized, 2x Capable</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The GS1 is optimized for 1x drivetrains, which helps keep the rear triangle tight and the chainstay length race-ready. But if you’re a 2x holdout, good news—Ventum says the frame will still accommodate a front derailleur and traditional gearing setups. That flexibility makes it a solid choice for riders who want to combine racing with bike-packing or ultra-distance efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-rival-front--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"8192\" height=\"5464\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-rival-front--jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ventum GS1 rival front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-rival-front--jpg.webp 8192w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-rival-front--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-rival-front--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-rival-front--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-rival-front--768x512.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cockpit &amp; Routing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Clean lines continue with entirely internal cable routing, including through the headset, giving the front end a smooth, wind-cheating aesthetic. The flat-mount disc brakes and 12mm thru-axles, front and rear, bring modern standards and compatibility, while the T47 bottom bracket keeps things creak-free and stiff under load. Expect the GS1 to play nicely with electronic drivetrains, dropper posts, and wide-range gearing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-Geomtery-.png\"><img width=\"2114\" height=\"1006\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-Geomtery-.png\" alt=\"Ventum GS1 Geomtery\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-Geomtery-.png 2114w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-Geomtery--297x141.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-Geomtery--1536x731.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-Geomtery--120x57.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-Geomtery--768x365.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-Geomtery--2048x975.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ventum GS1 Geometry </h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>How does it differ from the current version?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reach</strong>: Extended by 10mm across all sizes, providing a more stretched-out position for improved stability at speed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wheelbase:</strong> Lengthened across all models lightly, most likely to enhance descending handling and comfort on rough gravel roads.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Chainstay Length:</strong> Remains at 420mm, preserving the bike’s snappy acceleration and agility.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-RED-XPLR--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"7858\" height=\"5241\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-RED-XPLR--jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ventum GS1 RED XPLR\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-RED-XPLR--jpg.webp 7858w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-RED-XPLR--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-RED-XPLR--1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-RED-XPLR--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-RED-XPLR--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-RED-XPLR--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ventum-GS1-RED-XPLR--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pricing and Availability – Ventum GS1</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The current offerings are SRAM RED XPLR and Shimano GRX 12-speed.
