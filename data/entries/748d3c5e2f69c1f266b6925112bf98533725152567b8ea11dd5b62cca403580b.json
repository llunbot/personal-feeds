But for everyone else, there's still <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/microsoft-office-2021-is-on-its-way/\">Office 2021</a>, an upgrade to Office 2019 that's coming to both Windows and macOS on October 5, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2021/09/16/office-ltsc-is-now-generally-available/\">Microsoft announced today</a>.Â Office 2021 will add the same features as the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/ltsc2021/overview\">Office Long-Term Servicing Channel</a> (or LTSC, catchy) release, which is available today.</p>\n\n<p>Compared to Office 2019, the last \"perpetual\" version of Office, the new version includes Dark Mode support, support for <a href=\"https://insider.office.com/en-us/blog/office-apps-now-support-opendocument-format-odf-1-3\">version 1.3 of the OpenDocument format</a>, new Excel functions and formulas, improved slide show recording for PowerPoint, and various user-interface tweaks and enhancements. Microsoft lists most of the new features <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-s-new-in-office-2021-43848c29-665d-4b1b-bc12-acd2bfb3910a#Platform=Windows_Desktop\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Microsoft plans to offer five years of \"Mainstream Support\" for Office 2021, without any extended support beyond that. The end date for Office 2021 support is in October of 2016, just a year after support ends for the Windows versions of Office 2016 and Office 2019.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795878#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795878&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"748d3c5e2f69c1f266b6925112bf98533725152567b8ea11dd5b62cca403580b","category":"Tech"}
