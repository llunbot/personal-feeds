Apple is now said to be developing a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/apple-tv-combined-homepod-camera/\">combined HomePod-Apple TV device</a> with a built-in screen and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> camera.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn his latest \"Power On\" newsletter, however, <em>Bloomberg</em> journalist Mark Gurman says that Apple engineers have personally expressed concerns to him about the direction of Apple's living room hardware strategy.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDespite the obvious benefits of an ‌Apple TV‌ for users invested in Apple's ecosystem, Gurman opines that the set-top box is largely failing in a market dominated by cheaper alternatives from the likes of Amazon and Roku, and that Apple needs to introduce a more competitively priced stick-like ‌Apple TV‌ or offer more features if it wants to stay relevant in the living room. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, \"as of now, it's hard to believe that will happen soon,\" claims Gurman, \"especially with Apple engineers telling me that the company doesn't have a strong living room hardware strategy and that there isn't much internal optimism.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGurman points out that the ‌Apple TV‌ software has gone through more interface redesigns that perhaps any other Apple product, and yet still it has failed to crack the market. Meanwhile, Apple's combined Apple TV-HomePod device remains <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/28/gurman-combined-homepod-apple-tv-in-development/\">on schedule</a> for release around 2023. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf that doesn't go well, Gurman suggests \"it might be time for Apple to consider putting the ‌Apple TV‌ on the same shelf as other living room products like the iPod HiFi and high-end ‌HomePod‌.\"<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/08/apple-engineers-pessimistic-apple-tv-strategy/\">Apple Engineers Reportedly Pessimistic About Apple's Living Room Hardware Strategy</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-engineers-reportedly-pessimistic-about-apples-living-room-hardware-strategy.2306915/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0WAQvxXbtj8:YlM2_0Weh6Q:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0WAQvxXbtj8:YlM2_0Weh6Q:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/0WAQvxXbtj8\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5ea6093afb665b5eca4db48dd3675ff24c995f98fa54217fd10076d3348a7efe","category":"Apple"}
