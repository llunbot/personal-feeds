Michael Storer (Team DSM) went on multiple attacks from the breakaway to scoop up Mountains points, eventually taking the lead from his teammate Romain Bardet atop Altu de la Cobertoria. After stealing the Mountains jersey Storer continued on alone, gaining over two minutes advantage on the breakaway behind him with 25 km to go. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead of the final climb and with less than 20 km to go the peloton absolved and spat out the breakaway. Storer, on the hunt for a third Vuelta stage win 2021, remained the only escapee out front.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David de la Cruz (UAE-Team Emirates) attacked from the peloton with 10 km left to climb and caught Storer with 7 km to go only to leave him in the mist. Behind the favourites start to fight each other. Miguel Ángel López (Movistar) attacked a group containg Roglič inside the final 4 km and passed De la Cruz over a km later. He continued on to win the stage alone, with Roglič finishing 14 seconds later. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n    <div>\n\t\t            <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLa Vuelta ciclista a España (2.UWT)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t                            <span>Salas → Altu d'El Gamoniteiru</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t                    </p>\n                    <div>\n                        <div>\n                            <a href=\"/race-result?race=256630\">Full\n                                results</a>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                        <img />\n\t\t\t\t\t                </div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>1</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">LÓPEZ Miguel Ángel</a>\n                                            <span>Movistar Team</span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <time>04:41:21</time>\n                                </div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>2</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">ROGLIČ Primož</a>\n                                            <span>Team Jumbo-Visma</span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <time>00:00:14</time>\n                                </div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>3</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">MAS Enric</a>\n                                            <span>Movistar Team</span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <time>00:00:20</time>\n                                </div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>4</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">BERNAL Egan</a>\n                                            <span>INEOS Grenadiers</span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <time>00:00:22</time>\n                                </div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>5</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">HAIG Jack</a>\n                                            <span>Bahrain -
