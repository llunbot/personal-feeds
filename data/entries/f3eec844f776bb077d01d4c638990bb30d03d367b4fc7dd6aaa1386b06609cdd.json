{"title":"New: 'Apple Intelligence' AI Service for iOS 18 Will Have These Features","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/07/apple-intelligence-service-wwdc/","date":1717758786000,"content":"Apple will announce its new AI feature set for Apple devices at WWDC on June 10, and <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-07/apple-wwdc-2024-what-to-expect-ai-ipados-18-macos-15-siri-updates-more\">reports</a> that it will be officially called \"Apple Intelligence.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iOS-18-Siri-Integrated-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe AI capabilities will be coming to iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15. The features will be opt-in, meaning Apple won't make users adopt them if they don't want to. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe processing requirements of AI will mean that users need an iPhone 15 Pro or one of the iPhone 16 models coming out this year to use it. For those using iPads or Macs, models will need an M1 chip at least. Apple's AI features will be powered by its own technology and tools from OpenAI, but there will also be a partnership with OpenAI that powers a ChatGPT-like chatbot.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Intelligence is expected to handle basic AI tasks, and it will work mostly on-device. In other words, the model is powered by the device's onboard processor, rather than in the cloud. It's not clear what the criteria for a basic task will be, but Apple Intelligence is said to include code that determines if a request can be processed on device or requires Apple's servers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere are some of the key new AI-related features and changes rumored or previewed for iPhones, iPads, and Macs that we've covered so far:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Apple Music:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/\">Auto-generated playlists</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/ios-18-apple-music-song-transitions/\">smarter song transitions</a>.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Apple News:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/\">AI-generated news article summaries</a>.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Health:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-15/apple-s-ai-plans-github-copilot-rival-for-developers-tool-for-testing-apps\">New features powered by AI</a>, but no specific details are known yet.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Keynote and Pages:</strong> AI-powered features for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/\">auto-generating slides in Keynote, writing faster in Pages, and more</a>.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Mail:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/ios-18-mail-app-ai-features-smart-reply/\">Incoming email categorization, and suggested replies to emails,</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/ios-18-mail-app-ai-features-smart-reply/\">email thread summaries and text composition assistance</a>.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Messages:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/ios-18-rumored-features-for-messages-app/\">Per-word effects, suggested replies, custom emoji, message recaps</a>.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Notes:</strong> A built-in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/ios-18-notes-app-voice-memos-math-rumors/\">audio recording tool</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/ios-18-audio-transcriptions-rumor/\">audio transcriptions</a></li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Notifications:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/\">AI-generated notification summaries</a>.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Photos:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/\">AI-powered photo retouching</a>.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Safari:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/ios-18-safari-browsing-assistant-rumor/\">Browsing assistant</a> that can <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/safari-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/\">summarize web pages</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/safari-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/\">\"Web Eraser\" tool</a>.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Siri:</strong> A <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/\">smarter ChatGPT-inspired version of Siri</a> with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/30/ai-siri-features-ios-18-2025/\">more per-app controls</a> (<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/30/ai-siri-features-ios-18-2025/\">in 2025</a>).</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Spotlight:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/03/ios-18-ai-features-for-siri-spotlight-revealed/\">More intelligent search results and improved sorting</a>.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Voice Memos:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/ios-18-audio-transcriptions-rumor/\">Audio transcriptions</a>.</li></ul>Gurman says that The AI features will account for about half of Appleâ€™s WWDC keynote presentation, which starts at 10 a.m. Pacific time on June 10.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor those unable to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-apple-wwdc-2024-keynote-june-10/\">watch the live stream</a>, or who prefer to read a text version of the announcements, we'll have live coverage both here on MacRumors.com and through our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorslive?lang=en\">MacRumorsLive X (Twitter) account</a>, so make sure to follow.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/\">Apple GPT</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/07/apple-intelligence-service-wwdc/\">New: 'Apple Intelligence' AI Service for iOS 18 Will Have These Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-intelligence-ai-service-for-ios-18-will-have-these-features.2428357/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors -
