{"title":"The Onion Buys Alex Jones’s Infowars in Bankruptcy Auction","link":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/onion-wins-alex-jones-infowars-bankruptcy-auction-rcna179936","date":1731605005000,"content":"\n<p>Brandy Zadrozny and Erik Ortiz, NBC News:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Onion, the satirical news company that repeatedly spoofed\nconspiracy theorist Alex Jones, has won the bankruptcy auction for\ncontrol over his media empire — most notably Infowars, the\nfar-right, conspiracy-minded website that served as Jones’ primary\nonline platform.</p>\n\n<p>Jones announced the sale on X on Thursday morning.</p>\n\n<p>“I just got word 15 minutes ago that my lawyers and folks met with\nthe U.S. trustee over our bankruptcy this morning and they said\nthey are shutting us down even without a court order this\nmorning,” Jones said. [...]</p>\n\n<p>The Onion plans to shutter Jones’ Infowars and rebuild the website\nfeaturing well-known internet humor writers and content creators,\naccording to a person with knowledge of the sale. About an hour\nand a half after the announcement of the sale, Infowars’ website\nwas shut down.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you’d told me, say, eight years ago, that in 2024 one of two things would happen in 2024: Infowars would buy The Onion or The Onion would buy Infowars, I don’t know which I’d have considered more likely. But I know which outcome I’d have rooted for. This is just delightful. I think what makes it so amazing is “The Onion Buys Infowars” feels like a perfect Onion headline.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/14/the-onion-infowars\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"21e8ce914f2c66ed4e95d797880371aba29f9976a04e1e71185a191de811afea","category":"Tech"}
