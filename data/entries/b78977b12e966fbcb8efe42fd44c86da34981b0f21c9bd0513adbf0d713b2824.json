{"title":"Custom Domain Names as Bluesky Handles — Fun Feature, and Now a Business Model","link":"https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/7-05-2023-business-plan","date":1688681923000,"content":"\n<p>From the official Bluesky (pro tip: rhymes with <em>brewski</em> and <em>Russki</em>) blog:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We believe that there must be better strategies to sustain social\nnetworks that don’t require selling user data for ads. Our first\nstep in another direction is paid services, and we’re starting\nwith <a href=\"https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky\">custom domains</a>. While setting up a custom domain to\nuse with Bluesky and the AT Protocol is fairly straightforward, it\ndoes require some familiarity with domain registrars and DNS\nsettings. Yet, over 13,000 users have already either repurposed\ndomains they already owned to use as handles, or purchased a\ndomain solely because of Bluesky. Domains have so much potential\nas a personalized way to customize identities and as a\ndecentralized way to verify reputation that builds off the\nexisting web. For example, U.S. Senators have used the\n<code>senate.gov</code> domain to verify their identity on Bluesky without\nour involvement, and a third-party developer built a <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/skylink-bluesky-did-detec/aflpfginfpjhanhkmdpohpggpolfopmb\">web\nextension</a> that checks if websites are linked to an AT\nProtocol identity. The possibilities are wide in the\ndomain-as-a-handle space.</p>\n\n<p><em>We’re partnering with Namecheap, a popular domain registrar, to\n<a href=\"https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/7-05-2023-namecheap\">offer a service</a> for easy domain purchasing and management.</em>\nWith this, people can set a custom domain as their handle on\nBluesky and the AT Protocol in under a few minutes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Making it a built-in feature and a source of recurring revenue for the Bluesky company — legally, a public benefit corporation — is a great idea. Using a custom domain name as your handle is one of the best features of Bluesky and the AT Protocol, and it really is rather simple. But by building it in as a feature, Bluesky can make it <em>super</em> simple, and remove the possibility of error.</p>\n\n<p>In Bluesky’s settings (which are relatively concise), go to “Change Handle” under “Advanced”. Then tap (or click) “I have my own domain.” On the next screen enter the domain name you own and wish to use in the top field, and Bluesky <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/bluesky-custom-domain.png\">will show you the domain and value to enter at your registrar</a>. I’m using “gruber.foo”, but you can just as easily use a subdomain like “john.gruber.foo”. The Daring Fireball account on Bluesky will be “daringfireball.net” — I could have used “gruber.daringfireball.net” for my personal account. A publication like, say, The New York Times could allow reporters to each have official Bluesky accounts like “<em>reportername</em>.nytimes.com”. Verification, in a sense, is built in.</p>\n\n<p>Then just go to your domain registrar and create an entry of type “TXT” using the domain and value you copied from the Bluesky app. Wait a few minutes for the change to propagate and your custom domain is now your Bluesky handle. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/google-domains-gruber-foo-settings.png\">Here’s a screenshot</a> from my settings at Google Domains.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/06/bluesky-domain-names\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b78977b12e966fbcb8efe42fd44c86da34981b0f21c9bd0513adbf0d713b2824","category":"Tech"}
