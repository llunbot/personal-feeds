As the back-to-back Flèche Wallonne winner, Olympic and European champion <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/cyclist-s-31-inspirational-women-no14-anna-van-der-breggen\">Anna van der Breggen</a> was already the main rider to watch, but with her switch of teams from Rabo-Liv to Boels-Dolmans over the winter, she was now part of a squad of serial winners including<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/lizzie-deignan-cyclist\"> Lizzie Deignan</a>, Christine Majerus, Amy Pieters and Chantal van der Broek-Blaak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming into that April’s Amstel Gold Race though, Van der Breggen had notched only one win all season, and that was a team time-trial stage at the Healthy Ageing Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Cheers</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-669072382-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-669072382-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-669072382-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-669072382-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-669072382-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-669072382-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-669072382-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-669072382-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-669072382-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-669072382-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-669072382-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-669072382-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim De Waele/Corbis via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The men’s Amstel Gold Race has been a feature in the men’s calendar since 1966, but the first women’s edition was 2001 and it was gone again by 2004, only coming back in 2017, so the course was pretty much new to the riders on its return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A leading trio of Kasia Niewiadoma, Lizzie Deignan and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/elisa-longo-borghini-cyclist\">Elisa Longo Borghini</a> formed on the Cauberg and the rest of the favourites were left to chase from the reduced group behind. With the gap hovering at around 20 seconds, Ellen van Dijk was put on domestique duties for Sunweb teammate Coryn Rivera, taking the group to within 11 seconds by the time they reached the Bemelerberg with 8.5km to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Annemiek van Vleuten took the opportunity on that climb to make her move, and was followed by Rivera and Van der Breggen, soon catching the front three. With 7.1km to go, Deignan slowed the group down, giving her teammate Van der Breggen the perfect opportunity to attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She hit the final ascent of the Cauberg solo, 30 seconds ahead, and cemented her lead to finish almost a minute ahead of Deignan, who won the sprint for second ahead of an unusual joint third place for Van Vleuten and Niewiadoma, who couldn’t be separated by the photo finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One down.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+7\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-970x300.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Climbing the wall</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-670361680.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-670361680.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-670361680-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-670361680-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-670361680-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-670361680-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-670361680-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-670361680-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-670361680-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim De Waele/Corbis via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Van der Breggen truly made La Flèche Wallonne – and the brutal <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mur-de-huy-cycling\">Mur de Huy</a> – her own. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her first win came in 2015, when she attacked at the bottom of the Mur de Huy, and she went back-to-back in 2016, but this time waited to the final 200m to make her move. She switched it up again in 2017, and the results will make for familiar reading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the penultimate climb, the Côte de Cherave, Niewiadoma lit things up, and could only be followed by Deignan and Van der Breggen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like at Amstel, Deignan sat on the front and Van der Breggen attacked – before they’d even reached the Mur de Huy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In what was the largest winning margin in the history of the race, Van der Breggen cruised up the Mur de Huy, finishing 16 seconds ahead of Deignan, the second 1-2 for the pair in a matter of days and another third place for Niewiadoma. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n

final chapter of the 2017 Ardennes was the first edition of the women’s Liège-Bastogne-Liège. It featured the classic Liège hills of the Côte de La Redoute (2km, 8.9%) and Côte de La Roche aux Faucons (1.3km, 11%), and unsurprisingly Van der Breggen was the favourite going in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niewiadoma’s WM3 team were constantly on the attack and it would be their leader who got the action going in the favourites group on the Côte de La Roche aux Faucons, drawing out a strong quartet of Van der Breggen, Deignan, Ashleigh Moolman-Pasio and Elisa Longo Borghini. Keen to avoid another third place and shake off the Boels-Dolmans duo, Niewiadoma went again on the final climb, but could only drop Longo Borghini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This time it wasn’t the most explosive of attacks, rather a subtle nod from Deignan prompted Van der Breggen to simply ride off the front in the last 5km. Niewiadoma was left to do the work behind but had too much of a gap to close on the ramp to the finish, and Van der Breggen completed the Ardennes triple at the first ever opportunity, again ahead of Deignan and Niewiadoma.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The week was marked by dominance from Van der Breggen, but also the entire Boels-Dolmans unit. Deignan was able to not only work her teammate into the ideal position for her trio of successful attacks, but also then managed to finish second in all three races.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only two women have ever been crowned Queen of the Ardennes, with Demi Vollering also managing to sweep the races in 2023. But with Van der Breggen returning to the pro ranks for the first time since 2021, watch this space.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-history-anna-van-der-breggen-ardennes-2017\">Pro race history: Anna van der Breggen becomes Queen of the Ardennes in 2017</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"940cf190e482d12c6f07a78eef9c6105814c8343a7a981ee8eade1dafd150f08","category":"Cycling"}
