SharePlay is a new feature that's designed to let you watch TV, listen to music, and play games with friends and family members over <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/facetime-screen-sharing.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nSharePlay allows all kinds of apps to work with ‌FaceTime‌, with content synced for all people who are part of the ‌FaceTime‌ call. You can listen to music with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> and access shared playlists, watch synced TV shows and movies together, work out together, and even share your screen for things like group trip planning or device troubleshooting.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple designed SharePlay to work with first-party app options like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, Apple Fitness+, and ‌Apple Music‌, but there's also an API for developers so third-party apps can also use SharePlay ‌FaceTime‌ features <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/25/ios-15-1-shareplay-third-party-apps/\">for games and other experiences</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSharePlay is already available in the release versions of iOS 15.1, iPadOS 15.1, and tvOS 15.1, so the Monterey 12.1 update brings Macs in line with other Apple devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe full release notes for macOS 12.1:<blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\nmacOS Monterey 12.1 adds SharePlay, an entirely new way to have shared experiences with family and friends in FaceTime.
