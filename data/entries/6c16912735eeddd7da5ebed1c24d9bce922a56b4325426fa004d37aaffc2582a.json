And so, despite having no kids and still being in the middle of a pandemic that makes it dangerous to spend time with other people in small enclosed spaces, when Kia asked if I wanted to spend some time with its new $32,100 Carnival minivan I said yes. Because, as already noted, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/04/heres-why-its-high-time-for-a-minivan-renaissance/\">minivans are wonderful</a>.</p>\n<p>They're handsome, too, at least when we're talking about the Carnival. Kia's designers went with a two-box shape and embraced the boxiness. To my eye the proportions are spot-on, particularly in profile where its shape falls midway between hatchback and station wagon, but scaled up by 20 percent.</p>\n<p>Distinguishing features include the brand's big \"tiger nose\" grille up front and, since our test car was the Carnival SX (MSRP: $41,100), a textured chrome panel on the C pillar that gives you something interesting to look at up close. My photos fail to do justice to the optional ($495) ceramic silver paint, which sparkled with pink and gold flecks in the sunlight. Together with the SX's black alloy wheels and the silver accents, it all works rather well.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798244#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798244&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
