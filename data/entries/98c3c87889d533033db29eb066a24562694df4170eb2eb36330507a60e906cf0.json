There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light; a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we're going to take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder.</em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Good morning. It is October 30, and you didn't think I would miss out on a rocket launch photo from time to time, did you?</p>\n<p>This photograph was taken earlier this month, on October 13, during the mid-morning launch of the Psyche asteroid mission on a Falcon Heavy rocket with its 27 Merlin engines. The Psyche mission will study a metal-rich asteroid with the same name, and it is NASAâ€™s first spacecraft ever built to study an asteroid that has more metal than rock or ice. It's super intriguing because we don't know what we will find once we get there.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977552#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977552&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"98c3c87889d533033db29eb066a24562694df4170eb2eb36330507a60e906cf0","category":"Tech"}
