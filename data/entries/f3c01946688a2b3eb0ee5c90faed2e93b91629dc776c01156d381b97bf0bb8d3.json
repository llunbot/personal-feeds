That update is here now, but, unfathomably, Apple has decided Apple Intelligence isn’t important enough to add a chip powerful enough to support it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2025 iPad A16 release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pre-order the M3 iPad Air from <strong>Wednesday, March 4</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>On sale from <strong>Wednesday</strong>, <strong>March 12</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>On March 3 Tim Cook tweeted a message that “this week” something is “in the Air”, suggesting a new product will launch soon.
