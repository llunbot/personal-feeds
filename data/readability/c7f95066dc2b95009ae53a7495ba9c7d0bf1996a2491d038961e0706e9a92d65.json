The brand will introduce the tech at the 2021 UCI Road World Championship on Sunday, with Tadej Pogačar’s brand new V3Rs leading the way.</p><p>The Italian bike maker says that the innovation’s principal utility is to securely prove ownership of all its frames.

Just don’t forget to transfer that virtual token should you sell the actual IRL bike at some point.</p><h2>Colnago blockchain security tech details</h2><div id=\"attachment_272619\"><p><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-272619\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/24093523/1asfee.jpg\" alt=\"colnago blockchain bike security\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/24093523/1asfee.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/24093523/1asfee-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/24093523/1asfee-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/24093523/1asfee-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/24093523/1asfee-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-272619\">Colnago’s inextricable RFID tag</p></div><p>So what does all this look like — visible, tangible? 8-bit? Something else?</p><p>First, Colnago makes each RFID tag integral to the frame by embedding it on the downtube. The tag connects the bike to the Automotive Blockchain ledger. The ledger records every significant transaction involving any frame — principally its manufacture, transport, and sale. Technicalities of blockchain distribution dictate that once an owner registers their bike, it cannot be faked or changed. Though anyone on the MyLime platform can access the information, it promises unalterable proof of ownership.</p><h2>Pogačar will ride it at UCI World Championships</h2><div id=\"attachment_272620\"><p><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-272620\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/24093823/Colnago_V3Rs_IceFire_sign_whiteback1.jpg\" alt=\"colnago blockchain\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/24093823/Colnago_V3Rs_IceFire_sign_whiteback1.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/24093823/Colnago_V3Rs_IceFire_sign_whiteback1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/24093823/Colnago_V3Rs_IceFire_sign_whiteback1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/24093823/Colnago_V3Rs_IceFire_sign_whiteback1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/24093823/Colnago_V3Rs_IceFire_sign_whiteback1-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-272620\">Pogačar’s “Ice &amp; Fire” blockchain-secured Colnago V3Rs</p></div><p>Tadej Pogačar will ride his own blockchain-secured Colnago V3Rs on Sunday, September 26, during the 2021 UCI Road World Championship.
