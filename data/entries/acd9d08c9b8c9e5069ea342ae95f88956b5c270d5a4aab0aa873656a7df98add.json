That’s the second Tuesday in September, and historically the most likely day. We think the likelihood that this report pans out is very high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will unveil the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16</a> line and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157474/new-apple-watch-2024-release-date.html\">Apple Watch Series 10 and Ultra 3</a>. As they have done in recent years, the iPhones will be available for preorder the following Friday, which is September 13 in this case. Then the new iPhones become available the following week on September 20.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman says Apple will announce <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">new AirPods</a> together with the expected iPhone and Apple Watch announcements. There will be two models: a new entry-level model with a new design, and a new mid-tier model that includes noise cancelling for the first time. You can think of these as replacements for the 2nd-generation and 3rd-generation AirPods as far as marketing positioning goes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>New AirPods Max, which have been rumored to be on the way this year as well, are not mentioned in Gurman’s report. That product could be announced at an event in October where we think Apple will announce the first <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2426453/heres-what-to-expect-from-every-m4-mac-and-when-theyre-coming.html\">M4 Macs</a>, perhaps.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"acd9d08c9b8c9e5069ea342ae95f88956b5c270d5a4aab0aa873656a7df98add","category":"Apple"}
