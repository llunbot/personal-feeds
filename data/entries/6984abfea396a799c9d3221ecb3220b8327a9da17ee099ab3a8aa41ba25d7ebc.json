Any bicycle with spare spokes taped to it, especially on the chainstay or seat stay, I think ought to be referred to as what it probably is: a touring bike. I humbly and pedantically submit my Meriwether custom-made steel longtail touring fat bike.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/IMG_9754-copy.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/IMG_9754-copy.jpeg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/IMG_9754-copy.jpeg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/IMG_9754-copy.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/IMG_9608.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/IMG_9608.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/IMG_9608.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/IMG_9608.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Over the last Austral winter, I rode about 9,600 km over four and a half months in the central and western deserts of Australia on this bicycle. The crux of this tour was the Canning Stock Route, which I rode over the course of 28 days, but I also had delightful times on the Abandoned Gunbarrel Highway, Sandy Blight Junction road, the Sandover Highway, the non-abandoned Gunbarrel Highway and all the connecting roads between these places. Old Andado Road was great too.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5089.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5089.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5089.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5089.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5086.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5086.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5086.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5086.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Two winters ago, I cycled across the Anne Beadell Highway and have also ridden on the Border Track between South Australia and Victoria. (This final one was during the Covid border lockdown years, and I was intercepted by SA police on patrol in an unmarked Hilux while out there.)</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5121.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5121.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5121.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5121.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5092.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5092.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5092.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5092.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5061.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5061.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5061.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5061.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Honestly, it rides like a bike. Unloaded, I often look behind myself to ensure that the rear rack is still there; it tends to disappear on me when not loaded down with dozens of liters of water and a week or two’s worth of food. This bike has cable routing for down tube shifters mounted on the seat tube, which I refer to as suicide shifters and have installed in the past. Motorcycles do this sometimes, but I first saw it on an Ira Ryan bicycle when I lived in Portland in the mid-aughts.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5096.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5096.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5096.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5096.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5063.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5063.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5063.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5063.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5088.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5088.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5088.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5088.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The fork takes a 197×12 hub so I get to have two rear wheels. You can’t take the Pugsley out of the boy. I took a Singletor in my repair kit in case of rear derailleur destruction, and maybe if things went pear-shaped, I could have swapped wheels and toddled out with a 22×20 singlespeed.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5117.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5117.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5117.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSCF5117.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>With racks, pedals and sealant it weighs about 22 kgs. It has a sparkly white paint job. White light, white heat. This bicycle is between and six and seven years old. I know that I am extremely lucky and fortunate to have a bicycle as amazing and well-built as this one. I would love to check out what’s in the deserts southeast of Broome, and am also curious about those sand tracks that go east from Cape Arid National Park into the Nullarbor.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Cover.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Cover.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Cover.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Cover.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I could also ride my exact route again next winter and be happy! It would be fun to cycle the CSR with someone, so in that small window after dinner when staring at the fire and before passing out with exhaustion, I could talk with someone about how beautiful the country is.</p>\n<p><strong>Build spec:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Steel frame and fork, removable front and rear racks Paul Klamper brakes</li>\n<li>Paul Love Levers</li>\n<li>180mm rotors</li>\n<li>Cane Creek Viscoset headset upper (set to full sticky)</li>\n<li>Chris King headset lower</li>\n<li>Spank stem</li>\n<li>Hunter Smooth Move handlebars</li>\n<li>Ergon GP2 grips</li>\n<li>Race Face Turbine cranks with 22/32T chainrings</li>\n<li>Chris King bottom bracket</li>\n<li>Burgtec composite pedals</li>\n<li>Shimano 105 chains (all I could find in Alice Springs mid-tour).
