If the European Commission properly enforces its decision, iPhone consumers could see even more wins, like lower cost payment options and better product experiences in the app.\"</blockquote>Spotify has been in a legal spat with Apple in the EU <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/13/spotify-files-complaint-vs-apple-in-europe/\">since 2019</a>, when it filed an antitrust complaint over App Store rules. As recently as March Spotify <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/14/spotify-no-apple-approval-subscription-update/\">complained</a> to the Commission that Apple was failing to approve a Spotify update that adds information on subscription pricing and links its website.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-allows-spotify-show-pricing-eu-app/\">Apple Allows Spotify to Show Pricing Info to EU Users in iPhone App</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-allows-spotify-to-show-pricing-info-to-eu-users-in-iphone-app.2433612/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bbe7d3b38fa238b25e466b5b82f1c9fe548bb20acd0dd370efed7c8ff9f6a9e2","category":"Apple"}
