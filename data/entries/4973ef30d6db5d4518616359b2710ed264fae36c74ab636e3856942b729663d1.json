Battery code in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/apple-releases-macos-monterey-release-candidate/\">macOS Monterey release candidate</a> mentions a \"High Power\" option, and this time, includes additional detail.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/macOS-Monterey-on-MBP-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n\"Your Mac will optimize performance to better support resource-intensive tasks. This may result in louder fan noise,\" reads the code. The mention was discovered by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveMoser\"><em>MacRumors</em> contributor Steve Moser</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere is no High Power mode that appears to be present in the ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta on an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Mac, so it's possible that this is something that's exclusive to the ‌M1‌ Pro and ‌M1‌ Max MacBook Pro machines that are launching next week. Such a feature was not mentioned on stage today.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/monterey-high-power-mention.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's also possible that this is a forthcoming feature that's not quite ready to launch and that's why we're not yet seeing it as a consumer-facing option in ‌macOS Monterey‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌macOS Monterey‌ is set to be released to the public on Monday, October 25, and the ‌M1‌ Pro and ‌M1‌ Max MacBook Pro models will begin arriving to customers the next day, so we won't have long to wait to find out if there's a hidden High Power mode.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234\">macOS Monterey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/macos-monterey-high-power-mode/\">Mentions of High Power Mode Possibly for New MacBook Pros Again Found in macOS Monterey</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mentions-of-high-power-mode-possibly-for-new-macbook-pros-again-found-in-macos-monterey.2317694/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5SEDRTwrGEo:QcyK3JRwwVI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5SEDRTwrGEo:QcyK3JRwwVI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/5SEDRTwrGEo\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4973ef30d6db5d4518616359b2710ed264fae36c74ab636e3856942b729663d1","category":"Apple"}
