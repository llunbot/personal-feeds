black background\" title=\"DSC03684\" />                                            <p>Ridley has taken advantage of UCI rule changes with its new Dean Fast time trial bike to improve aerodynamic performance.</p>\n<p>The Belgian brand claims the updated version of its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/time-trial-bikes/\">time trial bike</a> produces less drag due to a reduced frontal area and elongated tube shapes.</p>\n<p>The Dean Fast comes with a mountain-bike style Universal Derailleur Hanger and can accept up to a 60T chainring in a 2x configuration.</p>\n<p>We expect Ridley-sponsored men and women to race the Dean Fast in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-cycling-world-championships-tv-live-streams/\">2023 UCI World Championships</a> time trials.</p>\n<h2>Drag reduction measures</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ridley Dean Fast time trial bike on black background\" title=\"DSC03684\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Dean Fast frameset is a blank canvas to be specced as the rider pleases.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ridley</i></span></div>\n<p>The ‘3:1 rule’ meant the length-to-width ratio of bike frame tubes used in UCI competitions could not exceed three.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tech/2023-uci-rule-changes/\">UCI rule changes </a>relaxed the ratio to 8:1, allowing manufacturers to deepen tube shapes into a more aerodynamic profile.</p>\n<p>Ridley has capitalised on the relaxed regulations by elongating the head tube of the Dean Fast.</p>\n<p>The brand claims this reduces the amount of turbulence that flows behind and causes drag.</p>\n<p>Ridley says it has also benefited from the UCI easing restrictions on tube shape design.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ridley Dean Fast time trial bike cockpit\" title=\"DSC03696\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The stem sinks into the head tube, which extends back further than before in an hourglass shape.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ridley </i></span></div>\n<p>The new hourglass shape of the head tube “strategically shapes airflow” and diminishes the frame’s front profile, according to the brand.</p>\n<p>As before, the stem sits flush with the top tube, which is also claimed to reduce drag.</p>\n<p>Ridley has applied a textured surface, similar to the dimples on a golf ball, to certain areas of the Dean Fast to improve aerodynamics.</p>\n<p>F-Surface Plus technology, first used on the Ridley Noah Fast Disc, comprises small grooves which, by creating a little turbulence, cause air to flow closely to the surface of the frame.</p>\n<p>This reduces wind resistance on the rider and helps them go faster for the same amount of power, according to Ridley.</p>\n<p>The brand claims the Dean Fast’s PF30 <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">bottom bracket</a> further contributes to the frame’s sleek profile and aerodynamics.</p>\n<h2>Universal Derailleur Hanger on a time trial bike</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cassette and rear derailleur of Ridley Dean Fast time trial bike\" title=\"DSC03669\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Dean Fast is the only time trial bike we know of that uses the UDH.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ridley</i></span></div>\n<p>SRAM introduced the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/sram-udh/\">Universal Derailleur Hanger</a> to unify mountain bike derailleur hanger standards in 2019.</p>\n<p>However, Ridley says the technology can benefit road bikes and has specced it on the Dean Fast.</p>\n<p>Ridley isn’t the first brand to adopt the UDH standard outside of mountain bikes – the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/specialized-crux-expert-review-2/\">Specialized Crux</a> and Ventum GS1, for example, both use the standard.</p>\n<p>However, as far as we’re aware, this is the first time trial bike to adopt the UDH standard.</p>\n<p>The Dean Fast’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/front-derailleur/#bandonbrazeon\">bolt-on front derailleur</a> hanger is removable and can be covered with a cap if the rider switches to a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/1x-drivetrains/\">1x setup</a>.</p>\n<p>There is one front derailleur clamp for 53-40T chainrings and another option for a 60-47T combo.</p>\n<p>The Dean Fast is only compatible with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electronic-groupsets/\">electronic groupsets</a>. Removing the provision for mechanical cable routing gave the frame designers and engineers more freedom, according to Ridley.</p>\n<h2>Multiple bottle cage mounting points</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ridley Dean Fast time trial bike bottle bosses\" title=\"DSC03772\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There is a lower bottle cage mounting position for racing and a higher training position.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ridley</i></span></div>\n<p>On the down tube of the Dean Fast, there are two bottle cage mounting points.</p>\n<p>The higher position is designed to be used for training because it is easier to reach, according to Ridley.</p>\n<p>The brand says the lower position is less accessible but more aerodynamic and therefore optimal for racing.</p>\n<h2>How was the Ridley Dean Fast tested?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ridley Dean Fast time trial bike in wind tunnel\" title=\"DSC00558\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Ridley says its designers harnessed looser UCI rules to make the Dean Fast more aero.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ridley</i></span></div>\n<p>Ridley says it used Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to identify new designs that would minimise drag at 55 km/h – a very high speed for most of us, but one that is regularly attained in top-level time trials.</p>\n<p>The brand tested the most promising designs in a wind tunnel at Bike Valley in Beringen, Belgium.</p>\n<p>The winning frame design became the Dean Fast.</p>\n<h2>Sizing and geometry</h2>\n<p>The Ridley Dean Fast will be available as a frameset (including base bar) in small, medium and large sizes. Ridley will not offer the Dean Fast as a complete bike. Pricing is TBC.</p>\n<p>Ridley claims the Dean Fast frame weighs 1,250g in size medium, the base bar 341g and the fork 460g.</p>\n<p>Ridley says this gives riders the flexibility to customise the Dean Fast as they wish.</p>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th></th><th>S</th><th>M</th><th>L</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Saddle height</b> (mm)</td><td>790</td><td>790</td><td>830</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Seat tube length</b> (mm)</td><td>500</td><td>500</td><td>540</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Top tube length</b> (mm)</td><td>510</td><td>532</td><td>555</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Head tube length</b> (mm)</td><td>90</td><td>90</td><td>110</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Seat tube angle</b> (degrees)</td><td>74.5</td><td>74.5</td><td>74.5</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Head tube angle</b> (degrees)</td><td>71.5</td><td>72</td><td>72</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Chainstay length</b> (mm)</td><td>405</td><td>405</td><td>405</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Bottom bracket height</b> (mm)</td><td>75</td><td>75</td><td>75</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Wheelbase</b> (mm)</td><td>964</td><td>977</td><td>1,001</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Standover height</b> (mm)</td><td>763</td><td>767</td><td>786</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Stack</b> (mm)</td><td>495</td><td>499</td><td>518</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Reach</b> (mm)</td><td>373</td><td>394</td><td>411</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>","author":"Jack Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"3fe3d4c12a06cdab04f3068e31e7700258f7281402b00dd62fd3e20bcda49da6","category":"Cycling"}
