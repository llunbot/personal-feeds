But all indications suggest this new model will not be a more powerful \"Steam Deck 2.0\" that offers better pixel-pushing processors to support the latest high-end games.</p>\n<p>Last month, Valve sleuth Brad Lynch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sadlyitsbradley/status/1699836012900544823\">noticed</a> a South Korean certification under the Valve Corporation for a \"specific low-power wireless device\" in a new piece of hardware identified only by a model number: 1030.
