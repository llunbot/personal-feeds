Starting in February, employees will work at Apple's campuses and offces for one to two days each week.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThen in March, workers will be expected to be in the office Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, working from home on Wednesday and Friday. Teams that have a \"greater need to work in-person\" will not be able to be part of the hybrid work experience.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple also plans to allow employees to work remotely for up to one month per year, an increase from the prior two weeks that the company announced earlier in the year. \"This provides more opportunity to travel, be closer to your loved ones, or simply shake up your routines,\" Cook told employees in the letter.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAfter working from home for more than a year, some Apple employees are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/19/apple-employees-fighting-return-to-work/\">not pleased</a> that Apple is requiring them to return to the office, as the company has been able to release a number of new products with its remote work schedule.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple executives have always made it clear that employees are expected to return. \"Video conference calling has narrowed the distance between us, to be sure, but there are things it simply cannot replicate,\" Cook <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/02/apple-employees-returning-to-work/\">said back in June</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/20/apple-delays-return-to-office-until-january/\">pushed back the deadline</a> for when employees must return to work several times as COVID cases have continued to soar, and in August, the company said that employees would be able to stay home until at least January.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/\">Apple Park</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/18/apple-employees-returning-february/\">Apple Employees Expected to Return to Offices in February</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-employees-expected-to-return-to-offices-in-february.2323935/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fO5_B2gmwTI:W07IbxfVkyo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fO5_B2gmwTI:W07IbxfVkyo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0dff84ece47f80a53eb71ba9e3b1378657a0b80813768dbb302b8ff12e9a6219","category":"Apple"}
