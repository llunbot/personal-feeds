They say it’s the same material and process used on the SRAM RED AXS derailleur’s stock cages, just with a different (and dimpled) shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-2-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2043\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-2-jpg.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of new absoluteblack HOLLOWcage v2 oversize derailleur pulley.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-2-jpg.webp 2043w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-2-297x116.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-2-1536x601.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-2-120x47.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-2-768x301.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the benefits of this mono-plate design is that it can bend slightly, helping keep the lower jockey wheel pulley aimed more directly at the chainring, reducing lateral loading on the bearings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, the original looked a little like plastic, so this should help visually justify the €399 price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also now offer the lower lock-ring in colors besides the original’s flashy Rainbow/Oil Slick. Keep it a bit more subtle with black, titanium (color), gold, or red.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-3-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1427\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-3-jpg.webp\" alt=\"absoluteblack HOLLOWcage v2 oversize derailleur pulley shown from different angles.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-3-jpg.webp 1427w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-3-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-3-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-3-768x431.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve never seen aB’s OSPW before, there are quite a few things that make it unique…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than a standard two-piece cage that sandwiches pulleys between them, the HOLLOWcage uses a single mono plate with a massively oversized lower pulley that spins the toothed jockey wheel around a large diameter ring.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-4-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-4-jpg.webp\" alt=\"absoluteblack HOLLOWcage v2 oversize derailleur pulley bearings exploded view.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-4-jpg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-4-297x186.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-4-120x75.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-4-768x480.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They use a full ceramic design, with bearing races made out of 100% Zirconia Oxide ceramic, and balls are made of Silicon Nitride ceramic. They verify the material composition using X-ray diffraction by Lucideon Ltd, a specialist in ceramics and materials science.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-5-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-5-jpg.webp\" alt=\"absoluteblack HOLLOWcage v2 oversize derailleur pulley shown from back top side.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-5-jpg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-5-297x186.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-5-120x75.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-hollowcage-v2-ospw-5-768x480.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The upper guide pulley uses a special rubber ring around it to soften the chain’s contact with it, which they say reduces chain noise by ~5db, or about 40% over a standard Shimano Dura-Ace derailleur.<br /><br />MSRP is $419 / €399, available for Shimano Dura-Ace 9250 only at launch. Original owners of the HOLLOWcage V1 can get a discounted upgrade. I’ve been riding the original for a couple of years and it’s been great, and it is indeed noticeably quieter than stock cages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>GRAPHENlube wax chainlube updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-graphenlube-wax-chainlube-v2-a-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1199\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-graphenlube-wax-chainlube-v2-a-jpg.webp\" alt=\"absoluteblack graphenlube wax chain lube in new 50ml size.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-graphenlube-wax-chainlube-v2-a-jpg.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-graphenlube-wax-chainlube-v2-a-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-graphenlube-wax-chainlube-v2-a-1536x1151.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-graphenlube-wax-chainlube-v2-a-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-graphenlube-wax-chainlube-v2-a-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve wanted to try their graphene-infused wax chain lube but been turned off by the price, they’ve just added a smaller 50ml bottle for $43.90 (€39.90). They still offer a tiny 14ml sample size, but the 50ml bottle lets you immerse the chain if you want, or get quite a few drip applications out of it…enough for thousands of kilometers of riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’ve also recently updated the formula to last longer in wet conditions, claiming dramatically longer-lasting performance than their competition:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-graphenlube-wax-chainlube-v2-chart-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-graphenlube-wax-chainlube-v2-chart-jpg.webp\" alt=\"comparison chart of wax chain lubes.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-graphenlube-wax-chainlube-v2-chart-jpg.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-graphenlube-wax-chainlube-v2-chart-297x192.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-graphenlube-wax-chainlube-v2-chart-120x78.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/absoluteblack-graphenlube-wax-chainlube-v2-chart-768x497.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how they tested, in their words:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“All chains were prepared with single lube application according to manufacturer instructions. Friction test at 250W resistance, 100rpm cadence, 40km/h speed, 25deg C and 25% humidity. The test continued until the chain reached 8W losses. Chains and testing machine had a 5km warmup/break-in period. First 50km on the graph were recorded in DRY conditions. Without stopping the machine after the 50km mark chains were continuously sprayed with liquid to simulate wet road conditions. The liquid contains water, trace amounts of diesel oil and small amounts of micronized alumina powder to simulate the contaminants which get onto the chain when riding in the rain.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been using their original formula for several years and really like this one, too. If you have the means, it’s worth a try.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://absoluteblack.cc\" target=\"_blank\">absoluteBLACK.cc</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/absoluteblack-hollowcage-2-ospw-graphenlube-wax-chain-lube/\">absoluteBLACK updates HOLLOWcage OSPW &amp; GRAPHENlube for more speed</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"570fb4a3b098e9bf5c534c3033783592021db0a4c18adf70b86d6736bae216ad","category":"Cycling"}
