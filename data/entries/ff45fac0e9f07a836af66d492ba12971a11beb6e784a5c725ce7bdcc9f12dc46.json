We also talk about <a href=\"https://www.parktool.com\" target=\"_blank\">Park Tool’s</a> history, why they’re blue and why that color is so important to their brand, and how they come up with ideas for new tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really enjoyed this one, and some of his insights on learning are world-class.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<h3><strong>Want More?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Find every episode of the BikeRumor Podcast on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/bikerumor-podcast/id1455519558\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/bikerumor-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.podbean.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Podbean</a>, and through <a href=\"https://feed.podbean.com/bikerumor/feed.xml\" target=\"_blank\">RSS</a>, or wherever you listen to podcasts! Hit like, hit subscribe, and hit play!
