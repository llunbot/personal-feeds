The new Specialized S-Works Torch shoes are now offered in a Lace-up version that is lighter and about $100 cheaper than its BOA counterpart.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Torch Lace-up shoe\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized has been adding lace-up options to most of the S-Works shoe line for some time now.

What better way to show everyone on the group ride you’re most fashionable? <em>But seriously</em> — Eliminating the BOA enclosure removes the ability to overtighten and cause hot spots, which gives a level up in comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-tounge-out-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"449\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-tounge-out--800x449.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Torch Lace-up shoe tounge out\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-tounge-out--800x449.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-tounge-out--297x167.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-tounge-out--120x67.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-tounge-out--768x431.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-tounge-out--400x225.jpeg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-tounge-out--1200x675.jpeg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-tounge-out-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For some, the BOA dials don’t sit in the most comfortable place, and laces do not require any extra plastic molding to keep them in place. Eliminating the molding means a very pliable and supple shoe, especially considering the upper material. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-toe-box-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-toe-box--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Torch Lace-up shoe toe box\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-toe-box--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-toe-box--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-toe-box--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-toe-box--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-toe-box-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The S-Works Torch Laceup has a new upper with reinforcement in critical zones, redesigned from the BOA removal. Eliminating the asymmetrical BOA bed gives the shoe a super clean symmetrical look, with a striking line down the middle of the toe box.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-close-up-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-close-up--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Torch Lace-up shoe close up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-close-up--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-close-up--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-close-up--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-close-up--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-close-up-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>How is it different from the S-Works BOA Torch?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The lace-up version of the S-Works Torch carries overall (except the BOA) technology and features, including the new wider base plate, 4mm wider (than the previous S-Works 7 shoe) at the ball of the foot.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-i-bear-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-i-bear--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Torch Lace-up shoe i beam\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-i-bear--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-i-bear--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-i-bear--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-i-bear--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Specialized-S-Works-Torch-Lace-up-shoe-i-bear-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The sole and last are the same as used in the S-Works Torch (BOA), with a full carbon sole and internal ‘I-Beam.’ The I-Beam construction allows the sole to be super lightweight without excess carbon.
