And globally, the increase in water vapor caused by global warming is slowing the rate at which methane breaks down in the atmosphere. If those feedbacks intensify, scientists said, it could outpace efforts to cut methane from fossil fuel and other human sources.</p>\n<p>Methane traps about 80 times more heat than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period, and <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/methane/?intent=121#:~:text=(Learn%20more%20about%20the%20Global,(which%20began%20in%201750).\">scientists estimate</a> itâ€™s responsible for 20 to 30 percent of climate warming since the start of the industrial age, when atmospheric methane was at a concentration of about 0.7 parts per million. It has <a href=\"https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends_ch4/\">zig-zagged upward</a> since then, spiking with the first fossil gas boom in the 1980s, then leveling off slightly before a huge surge started in the early 2000s. The amount of methane in the atmosphere reached about 1.9 ppm in 2023, nearly three times the pre-industrial level.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045807#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045807&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Inside Climate News","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"97dc307e4a178d7722a011d9b0f85e30f8b8e6e9b20c711785cc97d7423af78f","category":"Tech"}
