During the company's annual WWDC keynote, Apple announced a ship date for watchOS—and a couple of notable new additions for Apple Watch users.</p>\n<p>The main focus of the watchOS 10 update is the addition of widgets, which are similar to those previously seen in iOS and iPadOS. Using widgets, Watch wearers will be able to access some information and features of Watch apps without actually launching or browsing around in those apps. Widgets will appear on the watch face by just turning the digital crown and will appear in a \"smart stack,\" and you can long-press on the stack to add more widgets. Apple demoed widgets for the weather, stocks, the calendar, fitness, timers, and complications, and developers will be able to add more, too.</p>\n<p>Apple also spruced up some of the built-in apps. The activity app now has corner icons for awards and other fitness tracking, and there are new full-screen views. These corner icons will be a theme in most of the new app designs. There are two new watch faces, a minimalistic color-based watch face called \"palette,\" and a licensed Snoopy &amp; Woodstock watch face.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944239#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944239&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"03cf85601f032e6291172e596af8c14d16a614545e383b7ab2ec1f8a0ebc61ba","category":"Tech"}
