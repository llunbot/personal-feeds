Triple-i's first event on Wednesday delivered 30-plus game trailers and teases within 45 minutes, and there was a consistent intrigue to all of them. There were some big names with some bigger studios loosely attached, and the definition of what is \"triple-i\" is quite vague, maybe intentionally. But there were a lot of games worth noting, especially on PC.</p>\n<p>What kind of games? Triple-i's website notes the announcement \"may contain traces of rogue-lites.\" At a breakpoint in the showcase, the omniscient text narrator notes there are \"Only a few more rogue-lites (promise).\" Triple-i was stuffed full of rogue-lites, roguelikes, survival, city-builders, deckbuilders, <em>Hades</em>-likes, 16-bit-esque platformers, <em>Vampire</em> <em>Survivors </em>and its progeny, turn-based tacticals, and then a car that sometimes has legs. There are strong trends in indie and indie-adjacent gaming, but also some real surprises.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016286#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016286&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"91dcd1da3eff88cebc4db6dfde99e364573511fa61c7634c66029139c7dcc796","category":"Tech"}
