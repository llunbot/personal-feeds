Water will constantly be supplied to the chain during the entire test period.</p>\n<p>“After 20 minutes, we remove the chain and check the ‘loss of watts’. Then we add it again to our water test. Every hour after that, we repeat the watt loss test. This process continues for five straight hours.”</p>\n<p>CeramicSpeed says external testing is also being carried out by Adam Kerin of Zero Friction Cycling. The brand says it will publish this data when it is available.</p>\n<h2>UFO Drip Indoor</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The UFO Drip Indoor chain lube is new, too.</span></figcaption><span> <i>@cyclingmedia_agency - Ceramicspeed Products-5-large</i></span></div>\n<p>CeramicSpeed says its Drip Indoor delivers the benefits of using a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-wax-a-chain/\">waxed chain</a> on your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-smart-trainer/\">smart trainer </a>without shedding excess wax onto your floor.</p>\n<p>The brand claims to have adjusted the formula of its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/chain-lubes/\">chain lube</a> to maximise efficiency while minimising build-up of wax on the chain.</p>\n<h2>UFO Bike Wash</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A bike wash has been added to the range, which also includes a drivetrain cleaner and bearing cleaner.</span></figcaption><span> <i>@cyclingmedia_agency - Ceramicspeed Products-5-large</i></span></div>\n<p>The UFO Bike Wash is said to be an eco-friendly, perfume- and scent-free foaming bike soap.</p>\n<p>CeramicSpeed says it’s safe to use on all parts of your bike, so you won’t need to worry about <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-silence-disc-brakes/\">contaminating your disc brakes</a> when you <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/clean-your-bike-in-7-simple-steps/\">clean your bike</a>.</p>\n<p>A 500ml bottle of UFO Bike Wash costs $22.</p>","author":"Jack Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"478fea27ca2647271306f2065e48e4f11acbed647f1628295c551066de2bde15","category":"Cycling"}
