And it’s just as modular and serviceable. It is also still a combination of CNC-machined 7075 alloy and 3D-printed PA12 plastic, rotating on an in-house machined bushing and offering tons of adjustability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply push the paddle to downshift. Pull back to release from the other side to upshift.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-Trigger-Shifter_new-prototype-shifter-and-existing-12sp-mechanical-rear-derailleur-for-mountain-bikes.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-Trigger-Shifter_new-prototype-shifter-and-existing-12sp-mechanical-rear-derailleur-for-mountain-bikes.jpg\" alt=\"Ingrid MTB Trigger Shifter prototype &amp; 12-speed mechanical rear derailleur, mountain bike groupset is made-in-Italy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-Trigger-Shifter_new-prototype-shifter-and-existing-12sp-mechanical-rear-derailleur-for-mountain-bikes.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-Trigger-Shifter_new-prototype-shifter-and-existing-12sp-mechanical-rear-derailleur-for-mountain-bikes-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-Trigger-Shifter_new-prototype-shifter-and-existing-12sp-mechanical-rear-derailleur-for-mountain-bikes-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-Trigger-Shifter_new-prototype-shifter-and-existing-12sp-mechanical-rear-derailleur-for-mountain-bikes-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-Trigger-Shifter_new-prototype-shifter-and-existing-12sp-mechanical-rear-derailleur-for-mountain-bikes-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all photos by Cory Benson, c. Bikerumor</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mounting is with a standard band clamp or MatchMaker direct mount. The shift lever angle is fully adjustable. And the end of the trigger can be replaced with a different shape paddle. The large black PA12 cylinder hold the shift ratchet inside. At first, Ingrid will offer the MTB Trigger Shifter with 12-speed compatibility to work with their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sneak-peek-prototype-ingrid-12sp-mtb-derailleur-3d-prints-cncs-mechanical-shifts-on-or-off-road/\" target=\"_blank\">RD1 derailleur</a> (SRAM Eagle gear spacing). But other options are inevitable. 11 &amp; 13-speed come to mind next. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New CRS MTB crankset protector, too</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-prototype-mechanical-mountain-bike-groupset_new-CRS-crankset-protector.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-prototype-mechanical-mountain-bike-groupset_new-CRS-crankset-protector.jpg\" alt=\"Ingrid alternative 12-speed mechanical mountain bike groupset, made-in-Italy, new CRS-crankset protector\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-prototype-mechanical-mountain-bike-groupset_new-CRS-crankset-protector.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-prototype-mechanical-mountain-bike-groupset_new-CRS-crankset-protector-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-prototype-mechanical-mountain-bike-groupset_new-CRS-crankset-protector-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-prototype-mechanical-mountain-bike-groupset_new-CRS-crankset-protector-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-prototype-mechanical-mountain-bike-groupset_new-CRS-crankset-protector-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-prototype-mechanical-mountain-bike-groupset_new-CRS-crankset-protector-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-prototype-mechanical-mountain-bike-groupset_new-CRS-crankset-protector-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-prototype-mechanical-mountain-bike-groupset_new-CRS-crankset-protector-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another nice little new detail, Ingrid has added an anti-scuff protector option for their cranks. Seen here on their heavy-duty, CRS-G2 MTB crankset, the protector is made of the same plastic as their crank boots protectors. The new anti-scuff guards are simply stuck in place with a durable double-sided adhesive, and continue the machined lines aesthetic of the crank arm underneath. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get them soon to protect all Ingrid CRS cranks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ingrid Dropbar Gravel &amp; 1x Road shifters, too.</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-Gravel-Dropbar-Shifter-Brake-prototype-and-complete-alternative-12-speed-mechanical-1x-road-gravel-bike-groupset_made-in-Italy.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-Gravel-Dropbar-Shifter-Brake-prototype-and-complete-alternative-12-speed-mechanical-1x-road-gravel-bike-groupset_made-in-Italy.jpg\" alt=\"Ingrid 1x Dropbar Shifter prototype, complete alternative 12-speed mechanical gravel road bike groupset, made-in-Italy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-Gravel-Dropbar-Shifter-Brake-prototype-and-complete-alternative-12-speed-mechanical-1x-road-gravel-bike-groupset_made-in-Italy.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-Gravel-Dropbar-Shifter-Brake-prototype-and-complete-alternative-12-speed-mechanical-1x-road-gravel-bike-groupset_made-in-Italy-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-Gravel-Dropbar-Shifter-Brake-prototype-and-complete-alternative-12-speed-mechanical-1x-road-gravel-bike-groupset_made-in-Italy-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-Gravel-Dropbar-Shifter-Brake-prototype-and-complete-alternative-12-speed-mechanical-1x-road-gravel-bike-groupset_made-in-Italy-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-Gravel-Dropbar-Shifter-Brake-prototype-and-complete-alternative-12-speed-mechanical-1x-road-gravel-bike-groupset_made-in-Italy-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-Gravel-Dropbar-Shifter-Brake-prototype-and-complete-alternative-12-speed-mechanical-1x-road-gravel-bike-groupset_made-in-Italy-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-Gravel-Dropbar-Shifter-Brake-prototype-and-complete-alternative-12-speed-mechanical-1x-road-gravel-bike-groupset_made-in-Italy-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Less further along in development are dropbar levers, too. But prototypes do now officially exist. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These were not working prototypes like the MTB shifters, so I could only get a feel for the shape of the hood, body, and angular lever at this point in development. They aren’t especially slim, but felt good in hand – even that long straight lever blade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, these are much more complicated, hiding a new brake master cylinder inside there, as well. Ingrid did say that the shift mechanics will be essentially the same as the MTB shifter. That means 12-speed compatibility at first, but 11 &amp; 13sp possibilities, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ingrid MTB shifter &amp; groupset – Pricing &amp; ultimate availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-Trigger-Shifter-prototype-and-complete-alternative-12-speed-mechanical-mountain-bike-groupset_made-in-Italy.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-Trigger-Shifter-prototype-and-complete-alternative-12-speed-mechanical-mountain-bike-groupset_made-in-Italy.jpg\" alt=\"Ingrid MTB Trigger Shifter prototype and complete alternative 12-speed mechanical mountain bike groupset, made-in-Italy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-Trigger-Shifter-prototype-and-complete-alternative-12-speed-mechanical-mountain-bike-groupset_made-in-Italy.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-Trigger-Shifter-prototype-and-complete-alternative-12-speed-mechanical-mountain-bike-groupset_made-in-Italy-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-Trigger-Shifter-prototype-and-complete-alternative-12-speed-mechanical-mountain-bike-groupset_made-in-Italy-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-Trigger-Shifter-prototype-and-complete-alternative-12-speed-mechanical-mountain-bike-groupset_made-in-Italy-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-Trigger-Shifter-prototype-and-complete-alternative-12-speed-mechanical-mountain-bike-groupset_made-in-Italy-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ingrid-MTB-Trigger-Shifter-prototype-and-complete-alternative-12-speed-mechanical-mountain-bike-groupset_made-in-Italy-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ingrid was reluctant to put a price on their new shifter just yet, but was happy to let me guess how much it would probably cost. That led to me optimistically lowballing them to try to see when their eyes perked up. We stopped virtually haggling somewhere north of 200€. That would make this about the most expensive single mechanical shifter on the market. But don’t forget, it’s totally made in Italy, and pairs with a 600€ mechanical derailleur. Plus, in the days of electronic drivetrains, it’s still cheaper that most AXS kit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for when you’ll be able to buy it? Soon. Officially, these are almost ready for production. So we expect you’ll be able to buy them at the start of next year. The road levers though, will have to wait at least another half year, we think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ingrid.bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Ingrid.bike</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ingrid-shifter-completes-1x-12-speed-mtb-drivetrain-made-in-italy-for-bespoked/\">Ingrid Shifter Completes 1x 12-speed MTB Drivetrain, Made-in-Italy for Bespoked</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"5360f025cd1b2b5e039b0b917423d173299595cd3e464ae56317bb3cf6bfdde2","category":"Cycling"}
