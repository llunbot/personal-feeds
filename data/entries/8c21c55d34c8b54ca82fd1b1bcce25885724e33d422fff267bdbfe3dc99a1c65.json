Right before you end up in the North Sea you’ll find yourself passing through the town of North Shields. It’s an area famous for its fishing port and shipyards, making it a fitting home for composites specialist Viola Townsend and her homemade carbon fibre bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s funny what boat builders view as waste,’ Townsend tells <em>Cyclist</em>. ‘The scrap from a 50-foot-long boat isn’t much to them, but just one little corner offcut could make nearly a whole bike.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Townsend’s background in composite engineering has put her in a unique position when it comes to building bikes. Her time spent working for a fishing rod company taught her about the science of tube construction, while her work in the boat industry has given her access to a bountiful supply of bike-building materials that would otherwise end up in landfill.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/me-and-my-bike-fish-fabrications\">Meet the maker: Sam Fish of Fish Fabrications</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/dan-craven-onguza-bicycles\">Meet the maker: Dan Craven of Onguza Bicycles</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 138: on sale now!</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>‘The fishing rod stuff was amazing for learning about tubing and how to tune material usage, different material types, fibre placement and how to tweak how much a tube bends just by putting different tapers in the material. It was very useful.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Townsend’s interest in bikes goes back to childhood. ‘They’ve been a major part of my life since I was old enough to form conscious thought,’ she says. As a child, she spent many a weekend with her cycling club chairman grandad, marshalling time-trials and learning the ins and outs of the sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She started building frames over half a decade ago while studying mechanical engineering at university, going on to hold composite engineering positions at companies specialising in everything from luxury vehicles to Olympic sailing dinghies. But bikes have always been a passion project in the background, and recently she committed to going full time with her brand, Sideways.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"741\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-02-741x970.jpg\" alt=\"Sideways Viola Townsend\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-02-741x970.jpg 741w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-02-229x300.jpg 229w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-02-768x1005.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-02-1174x1536.jpg 1174w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-02-750x981.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-02-1140x1492.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Having learned about tube construction at a fishing rod factory, Viola Townsend  uses scrap from the shipyards in her native North Shields to build unique carbon bikes</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘The name Sideways is about trying to be a little bit different,’ she says. ‘It’s about going against the grain and doing things my own way. There’s a bit more to it than that, but I think it’s good to leave a shroud of mystery.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment, Townsend is running Sideways out of her spare bedroom-cum-workshop, a far cry from the laboratory-like composite bike factories we’re used to seeing in big-brand marketing material. It works, though, and has allowed her to produce some remarkable bicycles. What’s more, it’s located just over the road from her former employer, Ovington Boats, which has proved handy in terms of sourcing materials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘For a while a lot of the materials I worked with were leftovers,’ says Townsend. ‘I showed a gravel bike that was pretty much 90 per cent scraps at Bespoked, and it won Best Off-Road Bike, and the lugged road bike here is almost 100 per cent scraps.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-03-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Sideways Viola Townsend\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-03-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-03-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-03-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>This rim brake racer is Townsend’s personal road bike, and is modelled loosely on the geometry of her 2011 Scott Addict. ‘It’s got quite an unforgiving position,’ she says. ‘But I’ve been on bikes my whole life, so folding myself onto the front of them doesn’t feel too bad. I built a frame for my dissertation that was very similar. There was a lot I wasn’t happy with due to time constraints and lack of experience, so four or five years later I decided to build it properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The way I’ve chosen to make the lugs is fairly complex. I make a mould of the exterior shape, then an inflatable bladder goes inside. I do the layup, close the mould up and then the bladder inflates and squishes it from the inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Then I make the tubes in the method that I learned at the fishing rod place. It’s roll wrapping – you make a mandrel and then roll the layers of carbon fibre around it. It’s really good for seat tubes and stuff where I need to guarantee the interior dimensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘From there it goes into the jig, and I use structural adhesive to join it all together. When properly applied it can hold a metre lever arm with a person hanging off it.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"646\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-04-646x970.jpg\" alt=\"Sideways Viola Townsend\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-04-646x970.jpg 646w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-04-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-04-1022x1536.jpg 1022w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-04-750x1127.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-04-1140x1713.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/sideways-viola-townsend-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Componentry-wise, it’s a bit of a hodgepodge of bits and bobs that Townsend has collected over the years. The groupset is a combination of Sram Red and Force 10-speed, with a pair of single-pivot callipers and an Easton wheelset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I used to love browsing through Weight Weenies listings,’ Townsend says. ‘I was always on the hunt for the cheapest, lightest upgrade I could make. All in all, I think this groupset cost me about £250.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Townsend has built numerous frames to date, but this was the first to bear the Sideways logo. Since completing it, she has built a hardtail mountain bike out of fishing rods and the aforementioned gravel bike, which gained a lot of attention at Bespoked after she earned a place through the show’s inclusivity scholarship. But as far as Townsend is concerned, this is just the beginning for Sideways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I’m always thinking,’ she says. ‘I’ve got a million and one different stupid ideas I’d like to work on. If you don’t get up every day and challenge yourself, there’s no real point in getting up at all.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• Sideways road bike; frames from £2,500.
