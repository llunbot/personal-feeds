{"title":"A new generative engine and three voices are now generally available on Amazon Polly","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/a-new-generative-engine-and-three-voices-are-now-generally-available-on-amazon-polly/","date":1715224630000,"content":"<p>Today, we are announcing the general availability of the generative engine of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/polly\">Amazon Polly</a> with three voices: Ruth and Matthew in American English and Amy in British English. The new generative engine was trained with publicly available and proprietary data, a variety of voices, languages, and styles. It performs with the highest precision to render context-dependent prosody, pausing, spelling, dialectal properties, foreign word pronunciation, and more.</p> \n<p>Amazon Polly is a machine learning (ML) service that converts text to lifelike speech, called text-to-speech (TTS) technology. Now, Amazon Polly includes high-quality, natural-sounding human-like voices in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/SupportedLanguage.html\">dozens of languages</a>, so you can select the ideal voice and distribute your speech-enabled applications in many locales or countries.</p> \n<p>With Amazon Polly, you can select various voice options, including neural, long-form, and generative voices, which deliver ground-breaking improvements in speech quality and produce human-like, highly expressive, and emotionally adept voices. You can store speech output in standard formats like MP3 or OGG, adjust the speech rate, pitch, or volume with <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/ssml.html\">Speech Synthesis Markup Language</a> (SSML) tags, and quickly deliver lifelike voices and conversational user experiences with consistently fast response times.</p> \n<p><strong><u>What’s the new generative engine?<br /> </u></strong>Amazon Polly now supports four voice engines: standard, neural, long-form, and generative voices.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/polly-text-to-speech-in-47-voices-and-24-languages/\">Standard TTS voices</a>, introduced in 2016 use traditional concatenative synthesis. This method strings together the phonemes of recorded speech, producing very natural-sounding synthesized speech. However, the inevitable variations in speech and the techniques used to segment the waveforms limit the quality of speech.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-polly-introduces-neural-text-to-speech-and-newscaster-style/\">Neural TTS (NTTS) voices</a>, introduced in 2019, use a sequence-to-sequence neural network that converts a sequence of phonemes into spectrograms, and a neural vocoder that converts the spectrograms into a continuous audio signal. The NTTS produces even higher quality human-like voices than its standard voices.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-long-form-voices-for-amazon-polly/\">Long-form voices</a>, introduced in 2023, are developed with cutting-edge deep learning TTS technology and designed to captivate listeners’ attention for longer content, such as news articles, training materials, or marketing videos.</p> \n<p>In February 2024, Amazon scientists introduced a new research TTS model called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.science/publications/base-tts-lessons-from-building-a-billion-parameter-text-to-speech-model-on-100k-hours-of-data\">Big Adaptive Streamable TTS with Emergent abilities (BASE)</a>. With this technology, Polly Generative engine is able to create human-like synthetically generated voices. You can use these voices as a knowledgeable customer assistant, a virtual trainer, or an experienced marketer.</p> \n<p>Here are the new generative voices:</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>Name</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Locale</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Gender</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Language</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Sample prompt</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>NTTS voices<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Generative voices<br /> </strong></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Ruth</td> \n   <td>en_US</td> \n   <td>Female</td> \n   <td>English (US)</td> \n   <td><code>Selma was lying on the ground halfway down the steps.
