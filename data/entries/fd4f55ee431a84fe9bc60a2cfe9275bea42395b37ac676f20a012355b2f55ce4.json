AnandTech, a staple of CPU and GPU news and reviews since 1997, will stop publishing today, according to <a href=\"https://www.anandtech.com/show/21542/end-of-the-road-an-anandtech-farewell\">an announcement</a> from Editor-in-Chief Ryan Smith.</p>\n<p>\"For better or worse, we’ve reached the end of a long journey—one that started with a <a href=\"https://www.anandtech.com/show/42/amd-k6-review\">review of an AMD processor</a>, and has ended with the <a href=\"https://www.anandtech.com/show/21524/the-amd-ryzen-9-9950x-and-ryzen-9-9900x-review\">review of an AMD processor</a>,\" wrote Smith, referring to reviews of AMD's K6 and Ryzen 9000-series chips, respectively. \"It’s fittingly poetic, but it is also a testament to the fact that we’ve spent the last 27 years doing what we love, covering the chips that are the lifeblood of the computing industry.\"</p>\n<p>The site's current owner, Future PLC, will keep the AnandTech archives online \"indefinitely\" and will continue to manage the site's forums, Smith wrote. Several AnandTech staffers will continue to publish articles at <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/\">Tom’s Hardware</a>, another '90s vintage technology site that continues to publish today (AnandTech and Tom’s have both been owned by the same company since 2014, though they retained separate sites and branding).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046409#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046409&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fd4f55ee431a84fe9bc60a2cfe9275bea42395b37ac676f20a012355b2f55ce4","category":"Tech"}
