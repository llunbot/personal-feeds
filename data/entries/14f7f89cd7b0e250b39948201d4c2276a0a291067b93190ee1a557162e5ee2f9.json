Between June and Oct. 26, 2022, the day before Twitter’s acquisition by Musk, there was a weekly average of 6,204 tweets deemed “plausibly antisemitic”—that is, where at least one reasonable interpretation of the tweet falls within the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s <a href=\"https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/sites/default/files/inline-files/legal%20analysis%20IHRA%20working%20definition%20of%20antisemitism.pdf\">definition of the term</a> as “a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred towards Jews.”</p>\n<p>But from Oct. 27 until Feb 9, 2023, the average was 12,762—an increase of 105%. In all, a total of 325,739 tweets from 146,516 accounts were labeled as “plausibly antisemitic” over the course of our study, stretching from June 1, 2022 to Feb. 9, 2023.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925490#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925490&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"The Conversation","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"14f7f89cd7b0e250b39948201d4c2276a0a291067b93190ee1a557162e5ee2f9","category":"Tech"}
