You can’t chuck a bread roll without hitting an Esteban Chaves, a Kasia Niewiadoma or a George Bennett.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The city was ‘discovered’ in the mid-1990s by American riders crossing the Atlantic to join the European pro circuit, and the trickle of interest became a flood when Lance Armstrong’s US Postal was the first team to establish a European base there in 1997. From the mid-2000s, for any rider to show they had what it took to make it in cycling, first they had to prove themselves on the local test-piece: Rocacorba.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the Anglos of that particular era are long gone, their successors have kept on coming. That means the Strava leaderboard, rather than being replete with Rauls, Enrics and Jordis, is made up mainly of names of the Harrison, Neilson, Brandon and Jordan variety. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current titleholder is actually a Brit, Paul Double of Human Powered Health, who claimed the title only this past summer. South African pro <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/cyclist-s-31-inspirational-women-no12-ashleigh-moolman-pasio\" target=\"_blank\">Ashleigh Moolman-Pasio</a> claimed the women’s record during the summer of Covid.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Classic climb: Rocacorba\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-02.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The road surface is silky in the early stages, but gets a lot rougher from the halfway mark.</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘The first day we could ride outside, I made it my mission,’ she told GCN in 2023. At the time of writing there isn’t another woman within four minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>In and out of fashion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Be warned. Where once Rocacorba was trendy, it is now just as likely to invite scorn. Tell a certain sort of person you’re excited to take it on and they will almost certainly reply with how overrated it is, or sniff about how many superior climbs there are in Catalunya.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-03-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Classic climb: Rocacorba\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-03-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-03-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-03-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-03-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-03-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-03-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-03.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Don’t be put off. Rocacorba would not have maintained its popularity among the pros if it didn’t offer a particular kind of test, one that is hard to find elsewhere. That challenge is one of variety rather than hard-as-nails difficulty. Rocacorba is not outrageously long nor is it particularly steep, but it has a way of draining energy through constant changes of gradient that make it tougher than its stats would suggest.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Classic climb: Rocacorba\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rocacorba-04.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘If there’s one thing that’s hard on this climb,’ says David Millar, former pro and founder of Velo Club Rocacorba, ‘it’s finding a rhythm.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first decision you’ll have to make is whether to tackle Rocacorba in its 14km form or the 10km version.

Besides, you’ll know the true beginning when you reach it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The start point, signposted at a bridge crossing of the El Matamors river, sees the road tilt up to 5% and leads you into the shadow of woodland, which is at once welcoming and a little daunting.

The downside is the lack of grand vistas to feast on as you rise.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A fridge too far</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This first kilometre is the kindest. You know you’re going uphill but it’s comfortable enough to stay in the big ring. You might even be moving swiftly enough to feel a breeze.

The green ‘Rocacorba’ road sign confirms your arrival. Stickers slapped over every square inch celebrate many of those who have preceded you. Take a moment to gaze towards the blissful lake of Banyoles below, then turn around and head back down.
