This function will be integrated across various listening modes, including noise cancellation and transparency mode â€“ but only in the US and Canada at launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeanwhile, the Hearing Test and Hearing Aid features are expected to be available fall 2024, according to Apple. Apple has obtained FDA authorization in the United States to market AirPods Pro 2 as \"clinical grade\" hearing aids. However, the company said in September that the Hearing Aid feature is pending marketing authorization from global health authorities, so there is a question mark over worldwide availability.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new hearing health functions allow AirPods Pro 2 owners to take hearing tests directly through their iPhone, with results stored in the Health app. For users who show signs of hearing loss, the AirPods can function as genuine hearing aids, boosting specific frequencies in real-time. The update also introduces advanced hearing protection features that automatically reduce exposure to loud environmental sounds.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/21/18-new-things-your-iphone-can-do-ios-18-1/\">18 New Things Your iPhone Can Do in iOS 18.1</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nThe company is expected to release iOS 18.1 to the public on Monday, October 28, bringing the new AirPods Pro 2 capabilities to eligible users.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<small><em>Article corrected to Hearing Protection regional limitations, not hearing features per se.
