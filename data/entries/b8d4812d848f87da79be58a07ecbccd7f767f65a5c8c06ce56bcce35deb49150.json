The initiative, known as “IronHeart” internally, is still in its early stages and would require the cooperation of automakers. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIronHeart would take CarPlay a step further. The iPhone-based system could access a range of controls, sensors and settings, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the project is secret. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThat includes inside and outside temperature and humidity readings, temperature zones, fans and the defroster systems, settings for adjusting surround-sound speakers, equalizers, tweeters, subwoofers, and the fade and balance, seats and armrests, the speedometer, tachometer and fuel instrument clusters.</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>More to follow…</strong><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg/\">Bloomberg</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/07/apple-expanding-carplay-ac-functions-more/\">Apple Looking to Expand CarPlay With New Integrations for AC, Seats, Instrument Cluster, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-looking-to-expand-carplay-with-new-integrations-for-ac-seats-instrument-cluster-and-more.2315815/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5IgrPpJyrOs:9dem9G1Cq1Q:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5IgrPpJyrOs:9dem9G1Cq1Q:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/5IgrPpJyrOs\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b8d4812d848f87da79be58a07ecbccd7f767f65a5c8c06ce56bcce35deb49150","category":"Apple"}
