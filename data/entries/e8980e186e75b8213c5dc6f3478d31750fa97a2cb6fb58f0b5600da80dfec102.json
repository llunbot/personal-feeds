Inspired by continued success on the World Tour in recent years, and driven by positive feedback from their 2021 SL series overhaul, Vision continues to improve their level of quality and top pro-race performance, while still retaining pricing below many of their top-tier competitors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These all-new Vision Metron 45 &amp; 60 RS wheels combine proven aerodynamics with lighter and stiffer carbon spokes and smoother hubs to create a premium aero wheelset with a hard-to-beat cost-to-performance ratio. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Vision Metron 45 &amp; 60 RS carbon spoke aero road wheels</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Metron has always been Vision’s fastest, most aerodynamic road bike wheel line. But in order to overcome its historically strong position as a primarily OEM brand, they’ve had to push the envelope in developing higher performance, lighter, stiffer, and better-performing wheels. For a brand known as the wheels that came stock on your bike, Vision is fighting hard to show they can deliver a wheelset worthy of upgrading and choosing over the likes of Enve or Zipp, for example. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these all-new carbon-spoked Metron RS wheels make a compelling argument.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what’s new?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lighter, stronger carbon spokes</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels_design-development.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels_design-development.webp\" alt=\"Vision Metron 45|60 RS carbon aero road wheels, R&amp;D\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels_design-development.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels_design-development-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels_design-development-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels_design-development-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels_design-development-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels_design-development-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Vision)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is Vision’s first full carbon wheelset to combine carbon rims with carbon spokes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new RS (<em>Racing Series</em>) wheels significantly improve on stiffness &amp; reactivity thanks to the new carbon spokes.

The higher tensile strength of the carbon spoke allows Vision to build wheels with essentially the same tension, yet create higher stiffness and more reactive/responsive wheels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The spokes are a full UD carbon body with a molded aero-bladed midsection, and on each end an alloy interface with hub &amp; rim. Those alloy ends are held mechanically in place with a tapered design that can’t separate. At the hub, they slot into a special T-head slot. At the rim, it looks like conventional external nipples, but what you actually see on the outside is that tooled alloy end of the spoke’s threads. And you actually tighten/adjust the spokes from inside of the rim bed via hidden internal nipples. Not simple, but if you damage a spoke, it is replaceable relatively easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New mid-depth aero rim profiles</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels_new-rim-section-profiles.webp\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels_new-rim-section-profiles.webp\" alt=\"Vision Metron 45|60 RS carbon aero road wheels, rim sections profiles\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels_new-rim-section-profiles.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels_new-rim-section-profiles-297x149.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels_new-rim-section-profiles-120x60.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels_new-rim-section-profiles-768x384.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new wheels feature two new blunt-nosed aerodynamic rim profiles – 45mm or 60mm deep.

Worst case, you can just pedal harder to make them quiet again!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Vision Metron RS – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels-review_photo-by-Mirror-Media-for-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_45RS-on-MMR.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels-review_photo-by-Mirror-Media-for-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_45RS-on-MMR.webp\" alt=\"Vision Metron 45 60 RS carbon spoke aero road wheels review, photo by Mirror Media for Road Bike Connection Spring, 45mm on MMR\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels-review_photo-by-Mirror-Media-for-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_45RS-on-MMR.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels-review_photo-by-Mirror-Media-for-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_45RS-on-MMR-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels-review_photo-by-Mirror-Media-for-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_45RS-on-MMR-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels-review_photo-by-Mirror-Media-for-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_45RS-on-MMR-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels-review_photo-by-Mirror-Media-for-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_45RS-on-MMR-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels-review_photo-by-Mirror-Media-for-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_45RS-on-MMR-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Vision Metron 45 RS</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These all-new carbon-spoked Vision Metron RS wheels are available now from your local FSA/Vision retailer, in 45mm or 60mm depths. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels-review_photo-by-Mirror-Media-for-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_glossy-on-matte-graphics.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels-review_photo-by-Mirror-Media-for-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_glossy-on-matte-graphics.webp\" alt=\"Vision Metron 45 60 RS carbon spoke aero road wheels review, photo by Mirror Media for Road Bike Connection Spring, gloss-on-matte graphics\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels-review_photo-by-Mirror-Media-for-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_glossy-on-matte-graphics.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels-review_photo-by-Mirror-Media-for-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_glossy-on-matte-graphics-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels-review_photo-by-Mirror-Media-for-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_glossy-on-matte-graphics-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels-review_photo-by-Mirror-Media-for-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_glossy-on-matte-graphics-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vision-Metron-45-60-RS-carbon-spoke-aero-road-wheels-review_photo-by-Mirror-Media-for-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_glossy-on-matte-graphics-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both are built entirely by hand, feature molded-in (not drilled) spoke holes, and get low-key straight-out-of-the-mold glossy-on matte carbon graphics.
