It appears to share the same <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/spotted-prototype-next-gen-xc-mtb-tires-from-maxxis-michelin-schwalbe/\" target=\"_blank\">Super Race</a> transparent (tanwall) sidewall construction we’ve seen on the XC race circuit for a couple of years.

But even here they are bigger than on Burt, with wider spacing and a less pronounced in-and-out offset of the outer row. Those tweaks presumably would improve grip in more varied -wetter and muddier- conditions, without sacrificing speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_tread-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_tread-detail-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Prototype Schwalbe First Ride fast-rolling XC race mountain bike tire, tread detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_tread-detail-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_tread-detail-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_tread-detail-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_tread-detail-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_tread-detail-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_tread-detail.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving out towards the shoulder, there’s an all-new row of transition tread with a low-profile, slightly trapezoidal lug spaced-out with 4 tiny horizontal bars in between. Then lastly, there’s another spaced-out row of the same new trapezoidal block but a bit larger for the tire’s shoulder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These simple more open-spaced and equally-offset transition &amp; shoulder lugs should provide more consistent grip while cornering, improved shoulder support, while also digging into loose terrain when needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Other interesting XC tread details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_Thoemus-team-setup.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_Thoemus-team-setup-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Prototype Schwalbe First Ride fast-rolling XC race mountain bike tire, Thoemus team\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_Thoemus-team-setup-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_Thoemus-team-setup-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_Thoemus-team-setup-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_Thoemus-team-setup-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_Thoemus-team-setup-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_Thoemus-team-setup-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_Thoemus-team-setup.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the Racing Ray &amp; Ralph, this new XC tire is not front- or rear-specific. But it is directional with lug edges slightly pointing forward at the top of the tire – for fast rolling but good braking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, while a lot of more aggressive trail-to-enduro tires employ share edges for extra grip, this new XC racing tire follows more of the rounded-knob trend we saw debut on Schwalbe’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/schwalbe-racing-brothers-ray-ralph-tires-rethink-xc-mountain-bike-grip/\" target=\"_blank\">Racing Brothers</a> update a few years back – which Schwalbe suggested also improved braking while cornering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, every tread lug gets a sipe to allow the individual block to deform more for grip over irregular obstacles – square cutouts for the center, horizontal lines cut from the transitions, and angle lines cut into the shoulder knobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_smooth-round-profile.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_smooth-round-profile-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Prototype Schwalbe First Ride fast-rolling XC race mountain bike tire, round profile\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_smooth-round-profile-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_smooth-round-profile-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_smooth-round-profile-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_smooth-round-profile-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_smooth-round-profile.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The prototype Schwalbe XC tire also appears to feature a more rounded overall cross-section, with those shoulder knobs extended further around the curved profile of the tire. There’s also not a huge relative difference in lug height from the center to the tire’s absolute outer edge. All of that suggests a tire that can be leaned incredibly far into a hard surface for faster cornering.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Is it a dry, mixed, or wet conditions XC race tire?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_dry-racing.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_dry-racing-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Prototype Schwalbe First Ride fast-rolling XC race mountain bike tire, dry racing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_dry-racing-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_dry-racing-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_dry-racing-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_dry-racing-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_dry-racing-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_dry-racing-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-Schwalbe-First-Ride-fast-rolling-XC-race-mountain-bike-tire_dry-racing.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Without knowing details from Schwalbe, we’d have to assume that this is meant to be an all-conditions XC race tire. We were lucky with mixed weather in Nove Mesto to see who rode the new tires and when. In the weekend’s races that stayed completely dry, Schwalbe XC racers seemed about evenly split between this new prototype and the existing Thunder Burt. But, whenever there was a threat of rain, it looked like the new tire prevailed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a
