Apple has also seeded a new beta of macOS Big Sur 11.6.2 for those who have not yet updated to Monterey or who can't on an older machine. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌macOS Monterey‌ 12.1 brings SharePlay to Macs for the first time. SharePlay is a new feature that's designed to let you watch TV, listen to music, and play games with friends and family members over <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/facetime-screen-sharing.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nSharePlay allows all kinds of apps to work with ‌FaceTime‌, with content synced for all people who are part of the ‌FaceTime‌ call. You can listen to music with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> and access shared playlists, watch synced TV shows and movies together, work out together, and even share your screen for things like group trip planning or device troubleshooting.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple designed SharePlay to work with first-party app options like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, Apple Fitness+, and ‌Apple Music‌, but there's also an API for developers so third-party apps can also use SharePlay ‌FaceTime‌ features <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/25/ios-15-1-shareplay-third-party-apps/\">for games and other experiences</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSharePlay is already available in the release versions of iOS 15.1, iPadOS 15.1, and tvOS 15.1, so the Monterey 12.1 update brings Macs in line with other Apple devices.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234\">macOS Monterey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/16/apple-seeds-macos-monterey-12-1-beta-3/\">Apple Seeds Third Beta of macOS Monterey 12.1 to Developers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-beta-of-macos-monterey-12-1-to-developers.2323644/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GNRD2ptZy0k:VT9eixl6ou0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GNRD2ptZy0k:VT9eixl6ou0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"896697a94925bd66707f267e0682042420dcd16a7ef98ebfb9b8ef53d92d4541","category":"Apple"}
