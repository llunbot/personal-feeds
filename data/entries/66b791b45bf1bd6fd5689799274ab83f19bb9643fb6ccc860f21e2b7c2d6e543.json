{"title":"Meta Company","link":"https://meta.company/","date":1635984081000,"content":"\n<p>Nate Skulic, founder of MetaCompany (a name they’ve been using since at least 2014):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On October 20th, 2021, during a phone call with Facebook\nattorneys, we declined their low offer and maintained our\nrequirements. At this point, we presumed it was Facebook and\nidentified them on the call. The attorney representing Facebook\ndeclared they would respect our existing right and registration.</p>\n\n<p>On October 28th, 2021, Facebook decided to commit trademark\ninfringement and call themselves “Meta”.</p>\n\n<p>They couldn’t buy us, so they tried to bury us by force of media.\nWe shouldn’t be surprised by these actions — from a company that\ncontinually says one thing and does another. Facebook and its\noperating officers are deceitful and acting in bad faith, not only\ntowards us, but to all of humanity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Looks like they’re going to fight Facebook for their name. Good for them.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a common word, so it would be surprising if they <em>weren’t</em> existing companies using “Meta”. There’s also <a href=\"https://www.meta.inc/\">Meta.inc</a>, founded by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/awilkinson/status/1453790072701001728\">Andrew Wilkinson</a>: “A long-term home for the world’s best digital agencies.”</p>\n\n<p>What is surprising to me is that Facebook didn’t use their “infinite money” cheat code and just buy these names. I think that’s basically <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/01/10/cisco-iphone-tm\">what Apple did</a> with the “iPhone” trademark <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/01/11/cisco-general\">that was held by Cisco</a> back in 2007. (I had forgotten that the prototype iPhones on display at Macworld Expo <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/01/10/cisco-lawsuit\">didn’t have “iPhone” printed on them</a>.) There’s an entitled petulance at play here on Facebook’s part.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/03/meta-company\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"66b791b45bf1bd6fd5689799274ab83f19bb9643fb6ccc860f21e2b7c2d6e543","category":"Tech"}
