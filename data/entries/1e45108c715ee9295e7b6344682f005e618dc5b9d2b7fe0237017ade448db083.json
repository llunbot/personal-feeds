There was a gentle form-factor change with Series 4, but at a glance, today’s Series 8 (and, almost certainly, next month’s Series 9) looks nearly identical to the original “Series 0” models. It’s almost criminally under-remarked-upon just how good the original Apple Watch design was. 1993 Macs didn’t look like the 1984 original Macintosh, except for the gimmicky <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Color_Classic\">Color Classic</a> that almost no one bought then and even fewer remember now. The iPhone underwent multiple major form factor revisions in its first decade: iPhone 4, 5, 6, and X. Yet here we are on the cusp of the 9th generation Apple Watch and the original design still looks fresh and remains band-compatible with the original models. But, says Gurman:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But that’s poised to change. Apple is planning a “Watch X” model\nto mark the device’s 10-year anniversary, and it promises to be\nthe biggest overhaul yet. (The category was unveiled in 2014 and\nreleased the following year, so Apple is planning to launch Watch\nX either in 2024 or 2025.) With the X model, Apple designers are\nworking on a thinner watch case and have explored changing the way\nbands are attached to the device.</p>\n\n<p>Starting with the original Apple Watch, bands have slid into the\nsides of the chassis and attached with a locking mechanism.\nKeeping that design the same let the bands stay compatible with\nold and new models, but it has downsides. People involved in the\ndevelopment of new Apple Watches say the system takes up a\nconsiderable amount of space that could be better filled with a\nbigger battery or other components.</p>\n\n<p>To that end, the company has explored a new magnetic band\nattachment system, though it’s unclear if it will be ready or used\nin the Watch X revamp. Even bigger changes are coming as well: a\nmicroLED display that tops the color and clarity of the current\nOLED screens, as well as a technology for monitoring blood\npressure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Surely the band connectors will break backwards compatibility <em>eventually</em>, but it’s worth noting that even the Apple Watch Ultra is band-compatible with the regular “large” Apple Watches.</p>\n\n<p>If Apple goes with “X” in lieu of “10”, <em>a la</em> iPhone X, I’d still bet on “Series X”, not just “X”. And we can take it to the bank that all this will happen, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/14/prosser-flat-edge-watch\">just like we could when Gurman reported</a>, <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/29/apple-watch-series-7-size-faces-report/\">two weeks before it was announced</a> in 2021, that Series 7 would have both a flat display and flat-sided case. (Series 7 watches in fact had <em>rounder</em> displays and the curvature of the cases didn’t change a whit.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/gurman-watch-series-x\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1e45108c715ee9295e7b6344682f005e618dc5b9d2b7fe0237017ade448db083","category":"Tech"}
