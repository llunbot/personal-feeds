One way is to watch a Christmas special on TV, and one of the best is <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/a-charlie-brown-christmas/umc.cmc.mbxalimrwrtq72wj4h601pyf\"><em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em></a>. For decades, it aired on broadcast TV, but that’s no longer the case–it’s now an Apple TV+ exclusive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the fact that this institution is on a streaming service may cause you to exclaim, “Bah! Humbug!” and send Apple a stocking full of coal, but stop, sip some egg nog, and relax–<em>yes, I’m talking about you, Uncle Fred</em>. Apple is making <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em> available to anyone to watch for free, for a limited time. If you are an Apple TV+ subscriber, however, you can watch it anytime.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h2>How to watch <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em> for free on Apple TV+</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 14 and 15, anyone with an Apple ID can watch <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/a-charlie-brown-christmas/umc.cmc.mbxalimrwrtq72wj4h601pyf\"><em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em></a>. Anyone who owns an Apple device has an Apple ID, but if you don’t, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/334285/how-to-set-up-an-apple-id-without-using-a-payment-method.html\">Apple IDs are free</a> and you don’t need a credit card to sign up. Once you have signed up, you can watch in several ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Through the TV app on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On smart TVs with the Apple TV app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On the web at <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com\">tv.apple.com</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On an Apple TV device.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has all the classic Peanuts specials for the holiday season that used to air over broadcast TV. There is one more holiday special left for the season, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/happy-new-year-charlie-brown/umc.cmc.72bog44gdxl0cafwane0z8r32&amp;xcust=1-1-1353489-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/1353489/how-to-watch-its-the-great-pumpkin-charlie-brown-for-free-on-apple-tv.html\"><em>Happy New Year, Charlie Brown</em></a>, but it doesn’t seem likely that it will be made available for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In case you missed them and your holiday season isn’t complete without watching them, you can watch <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/its-the-great-pumpkin-charlie-brown/umc.cmc.1c5nvp802hos5t3u0umlukkwh\"><em>It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown</em></a> and <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/a-charlie-brown-thanksgiving/umc.cmc.7grdgbjdq3tiy37f4dc3yeyms\"><em>A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving</em></a> on Apple TV+–but they aren’t free anymore. You need to have an Apple TV+ subscription.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Years ago, <a href=\"//www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/apple-produce-new-peanuts-content-deal-new-series-specials-shorts-1169464\">Apple acquired the rights to the Peanuts cartoon</a><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/apple-produce-new-peanuts-content-deal-new-series-specials-shorts-1169464/\"> </a><a href=\"//www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/apple-produce-new-peanuts-content-deal-new-series-specials-shorts-1169464\">series</a> that stars Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy, and other memorable characters. Since then, Apple has aired new Peanuts shows such as <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/episode/happiness-is-the-gift-of-giving/umc.cmc.7dfsfn4aup8yc0uye42b5dfix\"><em>The Snoopy Show</em></a> and <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/show/snoopy-in-space-the-search-for-life/umc.cmc.12l86ri6vfjlimw2m8b8dzszs\"><em>Snoopy in Space</em></a>, and new movies, including <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/peanuts-in-space-secrets-of-apollo-10/umc.cmc.6ippzjfc3jg0l4b8x8cslmhfa\"><em>Peanuts in Space: Secrets of Apollo 10</em></a>, <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/lucys-school/umc.cmc.45v5b3bbri53qgfjhirzrivp2\"><em>Lucy’s School</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/its-the-small-things-charlie-brown/umc.cmc.gr1rsr9lp2tzfwb0w6zhq9y3\"><em>It’s the Small Things, Charlie Brown</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple TV+ subscription television streaming service is $9.99/£9.99 per month.
