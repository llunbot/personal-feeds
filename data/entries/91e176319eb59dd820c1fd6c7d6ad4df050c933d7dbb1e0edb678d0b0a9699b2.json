The finding puts to bed the earlier theory that the RecoveryOS partition was something exclusive to the A18 chip in the iPhone 16.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEvidence that Apple has been working on an over-the-air recovery method for iOS devices first appeared <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/02/26/ios-13-4-over-the-air-recovery-feature/\">way back in iOS 13.4</a>. Whether Apple intends to add the functionality to other iPhone or iPad models via a software update remains unclear. Apple introduced the iPad mini 7 on October 15, and the first pre-orders are arriving in the hands of customers today.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/ipad-mini-7-ota-recovery-ios-device/\">iPad Mini 7 Supports Over-the-Air Recovery Using Another iOS Device</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-mini-7-supports-over-the-air-recovery-using-another-ios-device.2440760/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"91e176319eb59dd820c1fd6c7d6ad4df050c933d7dbb1e0edb678d0b0a9699b2","category":"Apple"}
