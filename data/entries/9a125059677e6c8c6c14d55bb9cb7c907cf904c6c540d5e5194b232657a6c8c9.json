The 8-bit architecture debuted in 1976 and powered a small-business-PC revolution in conjunction with <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/718124/what-was-cpm-and-why-did-it-lose-to-ms-dos/\">CP/M</a>, also serving as the heart of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/game-boy-20th-anniversary/\">Nintendo Game Boy</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/egad-7-key-british-pcs-of-the-1980s-americans-might-have-missed/\">Sinclair ZX Spectrum</a>, the Radio Shack <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80\">TRS-80</a>, the <em>Pac-Man</em> arcade game, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-83_series\">TI-83</a> graphing calculator.</p>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.mouser.com/PCN/Littelfuse_PCN_Z84C00.pdf\">letter</a> to customers dated April 15, 2024, Zilog wrote, \"Please be advised that our Wafer Foundry Manufacturer will be discontinuing support for the Z80 product and other product lines. Refer to the attached list of the Z84C00 Z80 products affected.\"</p>\n<p>Designers typically use the Z84C00 chips because of familiarity with the Z80 architecture or to allow legacy system upgrades without needing significant system redesigns. And while many other embedded chip architectures have superseded these Z80 chips in speed, processing power, and capability, they remained go-to solutions for decades in products that didn't need any extra horsepower.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018763#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018763&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9a125059677e6c8c6c14d55bb9cb7c907cf904c6c540d5e5194b232657a6c8c9","category":"Tech"}
