My goal was to create a book to the absolute best of my abilities as a photographer and artist at this point in my journey. It truly represents my dedication and commitment to my craft with no compromises and illustrates my passion for studio photography, cycling and bicycles! I created it and put it out into the world with the hope that people will truly enjoy the book and recognize that it was a genuine labor of love.”</em> – Robert D.
