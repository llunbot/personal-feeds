SpaceX's steamroller is still rolling, but for the first time in many years, it doesn't seem like it's rolling downhill. After a three-year run of perfect performance—with no launch failures or any other serious malfunctions—SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket has suffered a handful of issues in recent months. Meanwhile, SpaceX's next-generation Starship rocket is having problems, too. Kiko Dontchev, SpaceX's vice president of launch, addressed some (but not all) of these concerns in a <a href=\"https://x.com/TurkeyBeaver/status/1899488103535923362\">post on X</a> this week. Despite the issues with the Falcon 9, SpaceX has maintained a remarkable launch cadence. As of Thursday, SpaceX has launched 28 Falcon 9 flights since January 1, ahead of last year's pace.</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>.

The two-stage, kerosene-fueled rocket will launch a self-funded technology demonstration satellite for Lockheed Martin. It's the first of up to 25 launches Lockheed Martin has booked with Firefly over the next five years. This launch will be the sixth flight of an Alpha rocket, which has become a leader in the US commercial launch industry for dedicated missions with one-ton-class satellites.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/rocket-report-ula-confirms-cause-of-booster-anomaly-crew-10-launch-on-tap/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/rocket-report-ula-confirms-cause-of-booster-anomaly-crew-10-launch-on-tap/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d7b55f674c1c6bc985755d6da5ac3eb9f51c6c49dc3d37f5d27716c70ad50fa5","category":"Tech"}
