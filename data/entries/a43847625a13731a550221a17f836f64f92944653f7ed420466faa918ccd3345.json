{"title":"Sports Tech Week in Review: March 10th, 2024","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/03/sports-review-march.html","date":1710074047000,"content":"<p><img title=\"WeekInReview-Roundup.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/03/WeekInReview-Roundup-1.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"479\" /></p>\n<p>The Week in Review is a collection of both all the goodness I’ve written during the past week around the internet, as well as a small pile of links I found interesting – generally endurance sports related. I’ve often wondered what to do with all of the coolness that people write, and while I share a lot of it on Twitter/X and Facebook, this is a better forum for sending it on to y’all. Most times these different streams don’t overlap, so be on the lookout at all these places for good stuff!</p>\n<p>So with that, let’s get into the action!</p>\n<h3><span><strong>DCR Posts In the Past Week:</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Here’s all the latest on the site:</p>\n<p><strong>Tuesday:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/03/looks-blade-pedals-power-meter-pedal-hands-on.html\"> Look’s New Road KEO Blade &amp; SPD Power Meter Pedals: Hands-on!</a></p>\n<p>A quieter week of travel for some product stuff, more to come soon!</p>\n<h3><span><strong>YouTube Videos This Past Week:</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Here’s what hit the tubes over on the You of Tube, definitely don’t forget to subscribe there to get notified of videos the second they hit!</p>\n<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<h3><span><strong>Stuff I Found Interesting Around The Interwebs:</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Here’s a not-so-small smattering of all the random things that I stumbled on while doing my civic duty to find the end of the Internet:</p>\n<p><strong>1) <a href=\"https://escapecollective.com/behind-f1s-velvet-curtain/\">Behind F1’s Velvet Curtain:</a> </strong>This article has caused all sorts of drama, where it was initially pulled from Road &amp; Track because…well…it probably ticked off F1. I see this article as less about F1 tech/etc, and a more interesting comparison between cycling &amp; F1 journalism/media coverage. The journalist (Kate Wagner), is also a writer at the Escape Collective, which has republished the pulled article in full.</p>\n<p><strong>2) <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/29/apple-fitness-teams-up-with-gympass/\">Apple Fitness+ now on Gympass:</a></strong> This was apparently announced <a href=\"https://gympass.com/en-us/blog/gympass-news/apple-fitness-plus-now-available-gympass/\">back in January</a>, but it definitely slipped by my radar in the flood of CES news that week. Anyways, interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>3) <a href=\"https://www.garmin.com/en-US/blog/outdoor/2023-garmin-inreach-sos-year-in-review/\">Garmin’s inReach SOS Year in Review:</a> </strong>This report charts every emergency button press, by location, type, and more. Worth a quick glance.</p>\n<p><strong>4) <a href=\"https://dronedj.com/2024/02/29/red-bull-drone-f1-fastest/\">The engineering of Redbull’s 300KPH F1-chasing drone:</a> </strong>You may have seen the social media snippets of that crazy F1 drone, but just in case you didn’t see some of the engineering aspects, the full Redbull YouTube video is worth a watch. Also, didn’t expect to have two F1 things in my round-up this week, since it’s been a very long time (if ever), since I’ve had even one F1 thing.</p>\n<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p><strong>5) <a href=\"https://connectthewatts.com/2024/03/08/more-peloton-games-tread-bike-gallery/\">Peloton is testing more new games on their platforms:</a> </strong>And these ones are definitely quite unique compared to the regular Peloton experience.</p>\n<p><strong>6) <a href=\"https://forum.slowtwitch.com/forum/Slowtwitch_Forums_C1/Triathlon_Forum_F1/Deakin_University_-_PhD_research_study_on_Age_Group_Triathlete_Training_Load_-_please_participate_P8095144/?page=unread#unread\">University research looking for data from age-group triathletes:</a></strong> Essentially they’re looking for 6-months of training data, and then a quick survey. You <a href=\"https://researchsurveys.deakin.edu.au/jfe/form/SV_0i8t6TYQt21Bwk6\">can enter here</a>, or more details at the Slowtwitch post link above.</p>\n<p><strong>7) <a href=\"https://shandor.medium.com/the-nix-hydration-biosensor-for-triathletes-55e809473476\">Nix Hydration Sensor Review:</a></strong> This came across my Twitter feed, and is quite well done. As some of you know, I started a review last year on the Nix Hydration Sensor, and had all assortment of problems. I did a large slate of tests, along with my wife, and also another friend as well. We did all the pre-workout naked weigh-ins (…not together with our friend), hydration and nutrition weight tracking, post-workout naked weigh-ins, etc… The whole thing. And TLDR: Nix was way off. Way way off. For all of us. All the time. Then, as I got close to review, Nix significantly changed their algorithms, to account for breathing losses. But I haven’t tested that. However, I have some hot-weather travel coming up next month, and will restart this entire naked circus again. In the meantime, that link/review seems to show exactly what I found a year ago, on virtually every level (from tech quirks to hydration data quirks)…except now just with current data/experience.</p>\n<p><strong>8) <a href=\"https://www.globalcyclingnetwork.com/racing/news/its-a-joke-anti-doping-testers-swoop-spanish-amateur-race-130-riders-abandon\">Anti-doping testers swoop Spanish amateur race, 130 riders abandon:</a> </strong>Well then, seems like there might be something slightly more important for the UCI and related authorities to focus on <a href=\"https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/uci-increase-fines-and-penalties-for-non-compliant-socks-and-clothing-in-2024-rule-update/\">than non-compliant socks</a>.</p>\n<p>–</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>","author":"DC Rainmaker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"a43847625a13731a550221a17f836f64f92944653f7ed420466faa918ccd3345","category":"Cycling"}
