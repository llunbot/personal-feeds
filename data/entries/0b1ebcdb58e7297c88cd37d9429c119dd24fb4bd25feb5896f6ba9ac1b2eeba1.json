This made the Long March 5, with a height of some 200 feet, the tallest rocket China has ever flown.</p>\n<p>Adding to the intrigue, the Chinese government claimed the spacecraft aboard the Long March 5 rocket, named Yaogan-41, is a high-altitude optical remote-sensing satellite. These types of surveillance satellites usually fly much closer to Earth to obtain the sharpest images possible of an adversary's military forces and strategically important sites.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991612#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991612&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0b1ebcdb58e7297c88cd37d9429c119dd24fb4bd25feb5896f6ba9ac1b2eeba1","category":"Tech"}
