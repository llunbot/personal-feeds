Colnago V4Rs has had a change of cockpit for the 2023 Tour de France.</p>\n<p>Pogačar had been using Colnago’s CC.01 handlebar through the first half of the season but ENVE has now supplied Pogačar with an as-yet-unreleased one-piece handlebar and stem.</p>\n<p>While ENVE has yet to officially launch its latest component, the brand told BikeRadar it’s based on the current two-piece SES Aero Road Handlebar but “with a few geometry tweaks to get Tadej the exact bar he was looking for”.</p>\n<p>The new handlebar has a knife-like leading edge and deep, flattened tops – all, of course, to improve its aerodynamic performance.</p>\n<p>ENVE came on board as the UAE Team Emirates wheel and handlebar partner in January.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago

for the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/events/tour-de-france/\">Tour de France</a>, and is made in-house in Utah.</p>\n<p>The handlebar uses the same In-Route internal routing design as found on ENVE’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/enve-melee-ultegra-di2-build-review/\">Melee</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/enve-mog-2023/\">MOG</a> road and

Pogačar.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>With this, any cables (not present on Pogačar’s bike as he uses wireless Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 shifters) and hydraulic hoses pass through the handlebar and stem before being routed through a cover above the upper headset bearing.</p>\n<p>Pogačar’s new handlebar will be available for sale later this summer, along with headset covers that, according to ENVE, will adapt the internal routing on “some of the leading bike brands” to accommodate In-Route.</p>\n<p>Pricing has not yet been
