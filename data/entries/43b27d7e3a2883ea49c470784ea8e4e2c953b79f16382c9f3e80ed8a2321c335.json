Vision says this creates a 'compact and unique structure' that is aerodynamically superior.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9856/vision-launches-new-metron-45-and-60-sl-disc-wheels-images#10\"><p><span>Image 11 of</span> 12</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/vision-metron-60sl-post-xdr.jpg?itok=C_dSOJ3t\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 11 of </span>12</p>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>Something the brand calls 'space-derived foam' has also been added between carbon layers to bring down the weight while maximising stiffness – we're assuming air space not outer space.</p>\n<p>Vision's new 'PRS technology' has been deployed in the hubs. It uses a 72-tooth engagement system, to bring the angle of freehub engagement down to a quick 5 degrees. They're also available with either a SH11 or XDR freehub.</p>\n<p>Finally, the 'top of the range' Italian-made spokes are aero-bladed and double-butted in stainless steel.</p>\n<h3>Sight for sore thighs</h3>\n<p>Both the Metron 45 SL Disc and Metron 60 SL Disc come in clincher/tubeless-ready and tubular versions, with the 45 and 60 indicating rim depth. It should mean that the 45 is the all-round performer, capable on cobbles, climbs and in <a href=\"/tags/cyclocross\">cyclocross</a>, while the 60 is mainly for fast, flat races.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1755/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2021: Everything you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8632/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-tour-de-france-2021\">How to watch and live stream the Tour de France 2021</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nThey are also impressively lightweight, coming in at a claimed 1,390g for the 45 and 1,460g for the 60.</p>\n<p>Pricewise there's not too much between the two, with the 45 costing €2,006 (about £1,724) and the 60 slightly more at €2,058 (about £1,770).</p>\n<p>For more information, visit <a href=\"https://www.visiontechusa.com/en/news/metron-45-60-sl-disc-world-premiere-tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">visiontechusa.com</a> </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/news/9856/vision-launches-new-metron-45-and-60-sl-disc-wheels-images\">Vision launches new Metron 45 and 60 SL Disc wheels images</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/news\">News</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>8 Jul 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9856%2Fvision-launches-new-metron-45-and-60-sl-disc-wheels-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Vision%20launches%20new%20Metron%2045%20and%2060%20SL%20Disc%20wheels%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9856%2Fvision-launches-new-metron-45-and-60-sl-disc-wheels-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Vision%20launches%20new%20Metron%2045%20and%2060%20SL%20Disc%20wheels%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9856%2Fvision-launches-new-metron-45-and-60-sl-disc-wheels-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Vision%20launches%20new%20Metron%2045%20and%2060%20SL%20Disc%20wheels%20images&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9856%2Fvision-launches-new-metron-45-and-60-sl-disc-wheels-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9856/vision-launches-new-metron-45-and-60-sl-disc-wheels-images#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 12</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/bettiniphoto_0524768_1_2000px.jpg?itok=NEGSS5GA\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/wheels\">Wheels</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"43b27d7e3a2883ea49c470784ea8e4e2c953b79f16382c9f3e80ed8a2321c335","category":"Cycling"}
