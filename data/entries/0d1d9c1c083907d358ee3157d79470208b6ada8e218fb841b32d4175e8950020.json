As a result, these outdated \"Series 0\" watches are no longer eligible for repairs or other service at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Provider locations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Watch-Edition-Gold-2015.jpg\" alt width=\"2117\" height=\"1191\" />\r<br />\nThe list of obsolete models includes the first-generation Apple Watch Edition with an 18-karat gold casing, which cost up to $17,000 in the U.S. when it was available. The solid-gold Apple Watch was discontinued in 2016 and replaced with a ceramic Apple Watch Edition, which was a more affordable luxury at up to $1,299. On the software side, watchOS 5 dropped compatibility with the solid-gold Apple Watch in 2018.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll other 38mm and 42mm aluminum and stainless steel versions of the original Apple Watch, including Herm√®s variants, are also now classified as obsolete.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple classifies a product as technologically obsolete once more than seven years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. The original Apple Watch was discontinued in September 2016 upon the release of Apple Watch Series 2 and Series 1 models, so the first-generation models recently crossed that seven-year mark.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has not yet updated its public-facing vintage and obsolete products list to reflect these additions, but that should happen soon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stellafudge\">@StellaFudge</a>!)</em><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/\">Vintage and Obsolete Apple Products</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/original-apple-watch-now-obsolete/\">Original Apple Watch is Now Obsolete, Including $17,000 Gold Model</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/original-apple-watch-is-now-obsolete-including-17-000-gold-model.2405966/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0d1d9c1c083907d358ee3157d79470208b6ada8e218fb841b32d4175e8950020","category":"Apple"}
