The cases are in people ranging from infants to the elderly, including a 100-year-old. Of the cases, 61 (52 percent) have been hospitalized, and two deaths have been reported in Minnesota.</p>\n<p>The CDC attributes the unusually high hospitalization rate to the fact that the pre-cut fruit was served at long-term care facilities and childcare centers. The elderly and young children are at higher risk of severe <em>Salmonella </em>illness.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987766#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987766&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"04a8e953fbf40828d7f0cc53cf876a481ccfce0870ddef823d5c1a5834265308","category":"Tech"}
