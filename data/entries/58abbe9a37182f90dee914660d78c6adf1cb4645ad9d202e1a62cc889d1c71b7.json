And it was… honestly, it was a bit overwhelming (in a good, bike nerd kinda way). For this story, I will get right to the gist of it. I ran into Charlie Murray, the man behind Heavy Bikes, early on in the show. When I saw the<a href=\"https://www.heavybikes.net/\" target=\"_blank\"> bike</a> that was on display, I was pretty skeptical. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, after talking with Charlie, it was clear that he was on to something. And his enthusiasm and genuine stoke about it was contagious. So, let’s talk about the bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Heavy Bikes: The Hypocrite Gravel Bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-hero.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-hero-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Heavy Bikes Hypocrite gravel bike hero\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-hero-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-hero-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-hero-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-hero-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-hero-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-hero.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all c.

They start the process with a custom bike fit. That fit drives a 3D-printed sand mold design. The mold is then filled with molten A356 aluminum. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-down-tube-to-bottom-bracket.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-down-tube-to-bottom-bracket-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Heavy Bikes Hypocrite gravel bike down tube to bottom bracket\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-down-tube-to-bottom-bracket-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-down-tube-to-bottom-bracket-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-down-tube-to-bottom-bracket-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-down-tube-to-bottom-bracket-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-down-tube-to-bottom-bracket-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-down-tube-to-bottom-bracket.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-down-tube.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-down-tube-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Heavy Bikes Hypocrite gravel bike down tube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-down-tube-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-down-tube-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-down-tube-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-down-tube-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-down-tube-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heavy-Bikes-Hypocrite-gravel-bike-down-tube.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Heavy Bikes says that “<em>the pressurized solidification ensures a properly filled part with enhanced mechanical properties</em>“.
