Freeride isn’t dead. It just somehow got blended in with a type of riding we do on bikes that we sometimes pedal to the top of the mountain. You’ll find more ‘enduro’ bikes and single-crown forks in bike parks most days than proper DH bikes with double-crowns. You even see riders at Rampage sending off cliffs on single-crown enduro forks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So suspension makers had to keep beefing up their single crowns to handle the 170mm, 180mm &amp;  190mm of single-crown travel that modern enduro buyers demanded.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>But really, why?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_UV-complete-on-black.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_UV-complete-on-black.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Formula Belva lightweight double-crown enduro mountain bike fork, 170mm or 180mm rtavel in purple\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_UV-complete-on-black.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_UV-complete-on-black-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_UV-complete-on-black-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_UV-complete-on-black-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_UV-complete-on-black-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_UV-complete-on-black-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For Formula, it wasn’t about bigger travel, or necessarily saving a bunch of weight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their engineers just knew that building a dual-crown meant eliminating the inherent structural cantilever issue where a single crown, steerer &amp; stanchions come together. This is simply the point where most single-crown flex is going to occur, no matter how big the stanchions get.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_upper-crown-direct-mount-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_upper-crown-direct-mount-detail.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Formula Belva lightweight double-crown enduro mountain bike fork, upper crown detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_upper-crown-direct-mount-detail.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_upper-crown-direct-mount-detail-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_upper-crown-direct-mount-detail-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_upper-crown-direct-mount-detail-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_upper-crown-direct-mount-detail-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_upper-crown-direct-mount-detail-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So with the same 35mm diameter stanchions, Formula could significantly reduce flex and achieve more supple suspension action. Plus, they could lower stack if they wanted with a much shorter/thinner lower crown. They could deliver more precise and connected direct-mount steering. And all at very little additional weight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This fork weighs about 400g more than the lightest 170mm 29er Selva S – at a claimed 2370g for the new Belva.  But that’s still said to be lighter than either a 38mm-stanchion RockShox Zeb or Fox 38, either with 180mm of travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_crown-details-up-close.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_crown-details-up-close.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Formula Belva lightweight double-crown enduro mountain bike fork, crown details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_crown-details-up-close.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_crown-details-up-close-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_crown-details-up-close-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_crown-details-up-close-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_crown-details-up-close-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_crown-details-up-close-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Formula doesn’t really push the adjustable axle-to-crown aspect as their initial push it to work with getting the new fork as a simple direct-swap on existing bikes without changing suspension characteristics. But the dual-crown inherently gives riders ~1cm of a-c adjustment. That means you can probably replicate the setup of your existing fork exactly. But its much shorter-stack lower crown also means you could probably swap in a 180mm fork in the same a-c height of your current 170mm fork, without changing ride height or bike geometry. There’s simply much more opportunity for customized setup with a dual-crown. And Formula could easily lower stack on the lower crown by another centimeter if they wanted (or if there was demand.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_170-or-180mm-of-supple-freeride-MTB-travel_new-35mm-stanchions-and-crowns.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_170-or-180mm-of-supple-freeride-MTB-travel_new-35mm-stanchions-and-crowns.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Formula Belva lightweight double-crown enduro mountain bike fork, new uppers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_170-or-180mm-of-supple-freeride-MTB-travel_new-35mm-stanchions-and-crowns.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_170-or-180mm-of-supple-freeride-MTB-travel_new-35mm-stanchions-and-crowns-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_170-or-180mm-of-supple-freeride-MTB-travel_new-35mm-stanchions-and-crowns-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_170-or-180mm-of-supple-freeride-MTB-travel_new-35mm-stanchions-and-crowns-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_170-or-180mm-of-supple-freeride-MTB-travel_new-35mm-stanchions-and-crowns-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_170-or-180mm-of-supple-freeride-MTB-travel_new-35mm-stanchions-and-crowns-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The dual-crown Belva enduro fork delivers either 170mm or 180mm of internally adjustable travel.

The fork was just so smooth and handling so precise, that I felt like my personal skill level had instantly notched up a level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not nearly as stiff as a DH fork. But this is meant for a lighter, shorter travel, more maneuverable bike. One that you are likely to pedal back uphill sometimes, too. It truly felt like it soaked up hits better than every single crown fork I had ridden previously. So it gave me extra confidence to bomb root-strewn tracks and air it out a bit higher on the buff jump lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest obstacles to riding a dual-crown enduro fork though, is mental. It’s impossible not to see those stanchions extend up next to your headtube. And to know that you can only turn your bars about 30° to either side. It’s a real limit that must be contended with. No big casual whips, at least until you learn how to better-control the bike in the air than I do.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_170-or-180mm-of-supple-freeride-MTB-travel_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_airtime.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_170-or-180mm-of-supple-freeride-MTB-travel_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_airtime.jpg\" alt=\"Formula Belva prototype light double-crown enduro mountain bike fork with 180mm of freeride travel, bike park airtime\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_170-or-180mm-of-supple-freeride-MTB-travel_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_airtime.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_170-or-180mm-of-supple-freeride-MTB-travel_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_airtime-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_170-or-180mm-of-supple-freeride-MTB-travel_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_airtime-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_170-or-180mm-of-supple-freeride-MTB-travel_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_airtime-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_170-or-180mm-of-supple-freeride-MTB-travel_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_airtime-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Formula-Belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork_170-or-180mm-of-supple-freeride-MTB-travel_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_airtime-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo by Rupert Fowler/BCA)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, flying down rooted DH tracks, rocky bike park trails, and blasting berms at ungodly speeds – that’s a non-issue. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet riding steep, slow technical trail is a different story.
