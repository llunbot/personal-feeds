Sour will offer 20 of each new SRD mountain bike at a time, in 4 time slots over the year. That means that pre-orders for each set will open on 4 Jun, 23 Aug, 17 Oct &amp; 18 Feb 2025. In each pre-order window, once 20 of each bikes sell, you’ll have to wait 3 months for the next slot. Sour will deliver frames 10-12 weeks later. That is, the first buyers now should have their frames at the end of August, in time for autumn adventure races?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Sour-Racing-Development-steel-Cowboy-Cookie-and-Double-Choc-full-suspension-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_Riva-debut.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Sour-Racing-Development-steel-Cowboy-Cookie-and-Double-Choc-full-suspension-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_Riva-debut.jpg\" alt=\"Sour Racing Development steel Cowboy Cookie and Double Choc full-suspension mountain bikes made-in-Germany,  Riva debut\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Sour-Racing-Development-steel-Cowboy-Cookie-and-Double-Choc-full-suspension-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_Riva-debut.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Sour-Racing-Development-steel-Cowboy-Cookie-and-Double-Choc-full-suspension-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_Riva-debut-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Sour-Racing-Development-steel-Cowboy-Cookie-and-Double-Choc-full-suspension-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_Riva-debut-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Sour-Racing-Development-steel-Cowboy-Cookie-and-Double-Choc-full-suspension-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_Riva-debut-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Sour-Racing-Development-steel-Cowboy-Cookie-and-Double-Choc-full-suspension-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_Riva-debut-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Sour-Racing-Development-steel-Cowboy-Cookie-and-Double-Choc-full-suspension-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_Riva-debut-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both new SRD bikes are offered exclusively as frame-only for 3500€, without a shock (including 19% German VAT).
