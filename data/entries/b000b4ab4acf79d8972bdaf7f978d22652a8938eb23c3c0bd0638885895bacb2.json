So what exactly constitutes \"PhD-level AI\"? The term refers to models that supposedly perform tasks requiring doctoral-level expertise. These include agents conducting advanced research, writing and debugging complex code without human intervention, and analyzing large datasets to generate comprehensive reports. The key claim is that these models can tackle problems that typically require years of specialized academic training.</p>\n<p>Companies like OpenAI base their \"PhD-level\" claims on performance in specific benchmark tests. For example, OpenAI's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/\">o1 series</a> models reportedly performed well in science, coding, and math tests, with results similar to human PhD students on challenging tasks.
