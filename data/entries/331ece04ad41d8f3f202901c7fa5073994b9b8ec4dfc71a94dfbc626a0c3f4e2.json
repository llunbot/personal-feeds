Specific details are unknown but it appears the proprietary carbon stem belonging to the Argon-18 Pursuit frameset suffered a catastrophic failure. The 25-year-old hit his head in the incident and after walking to the infield, he was checked for concussion by medical staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three Australian remaining riders stopped their effort and were granted a restart by commissaires, albeit after Team Great Britain’s effort and after the finals of the women’s team sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-02-at-6.59.46-pm-12-1340x754.jpg\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier in the event Italy set a new Olympic record with a 3:45.895, beaten shortly afterwards by the reigning world champions Denmark who posted a 3:45.014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex Porter returned to the track for the restarted ride and Australia went on to qualify fifth fastest with a time of 3:48.448, less than a second behind Great Britain. That fifth position puts Australia out of gold medal contention. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>More to come …</em></p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/australians-handlebar-snaps-during-olympic-team-pursuit-qualifying/\">Read More</a>","author":"Matt de Neef","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"331ece04ad41d8f3f202901c7fa5073994b9b8ec4dfc71a94dfbc626a0c3f4e2","category":"Cycling"}
