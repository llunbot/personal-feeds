Over the course of his time in the sport, the Frenchman came to be known by the nickname of Dr. Mabuse, after the fictional German villain, although Sainz is not actually a licensed physician. He has described himself as a “naturopath.”</p><p>Sainz, 78, has already been convicted of offenses related to facilitating doping by cyclists and horses in the past, having received prison sentences (some of them suspended) and fines in multiple cases in the past 10 years. He was investigated for illegal practice of medicine in 1999 and in 2002 had his car searched in Belgium, turning up EPO, morphine, and clenbuterol. He told police he had been on his way to visit Vandenbroucke, who later claimed the drugs were for his dog.</p><p>The charges for which he now faces prison time came about after a French investigative television show caught Sainz on a hidden camera telling athletes how to dope.</p><p>Prosecutors in the current case have argued that Sainz is “dangerous for society,” noting that he has has told “vulnerable people,” including cancer patients, to “stop treatments” prescribed by physicians. Sainz’s defense team says that he has only given people nutritional advice.</p><p>A court decision in Sainz’s case is expected in January of 2022.</p></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"45c4015b60bbf58d01fe63ea351e011875d58251c28192be2f4464bf382ea22b","category":"Cycling"}
