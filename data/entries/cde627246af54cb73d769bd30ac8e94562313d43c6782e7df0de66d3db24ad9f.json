After all, we never know when a crash is going to happen.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, upper-body armour has become lighter and less restrictive compared to the bulky suits of years gone by.</p>\n<p>Much body armour now employs protective materials such as D3O or Koroyd and uses high-stretch or breathable fabrics to create comfortable and secure fits. This makes it easier to wear more of the time –  which consequently means you are better protected on more of your rides.</p>\n<p>It’s important to consider what type of riding you do when choosing upper-body protection for mountain biking (or, in fact, any type of protection). The more extreme your type of riding, the more protection you will need.</p>\n<p>If you’re taking to relatively easy trails and spend more time pedalling than heading downhill, lightweight protection might be suitable for you.</p>\n<p>If you’re racing in downhill events, riding black trails or sending some big jumps, you should invest in a jacket or suit that will protect more of your body.</p>\n<p>Our pick of the best body armour for mountain biking includes options for all manner of riding types. Our expert team of independent testers have racked up hours of riding and considered protection, fit, comfort, extra features and price when scoring these products.</p>\n<p>Finally, you should always wear a helmet when mountain biking, so be sure to check out our picks of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-helmets-for-trail-riding/\">best mountain bike helmets</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-enduro-helmets/\">best enduro helmets</a>.</p>\n<p>We have also included our <a href=\"#bodyarmourguide\">buyer’s guide to MTB body armour below</a>.</p>\n<h2>Best MTB body armour in 2023</h2>\n<h3>Fox Baseframe Pro Sleeveless Chest Guard</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Fox Baseframe Pro Sleeveless - protective vest for mountain bikers\" title=\"Best of protective Vests - Fox Baseframe Pro Sleeveless\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A snug fit holds the padding in place without the vest feeling overly tight.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £150 / $190 / €150 / AU$200 (as tested)</li>\n<li><strong>Back protection:</strong> D3O Viper Stealth (CE L1)</li>\n<li><strong>Additional protection:</strong> Foam hip pads</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Baseframe Pro is one of the most comfortable vests we’ve tested, going mostly unnoticed while riding.</p>\n<p>Fox uses a D3O insert, which is well-suited to trail riding.</p>\n<p>The Baseframe Pro is barely visible under a jersey, yet gives good coverage with a snug fit that holds the padding in place, without the vest feeling overly tight.</p>\n<p>Breathability is very good, but the Baseframe Pro is not as well ventilated as others we’ve tested.

<i>Craig Mercer - CameraSport / Contributor</i></span></div>\n<p>Wearing body armour can help minimise or even prevent injuries when crashing, helping you to keep riding instead of staying at home recovering.</p>\n<p>The best mountain bike armour features impact-absorbing pads that don’t take away from your on-bike mobility and will remain breathable on the hottest days when you’re standing at the back of the lift queue.</p>\n<p>Many riders choose to wear armour on every ride, while some reserve it for tracks and trails with large jumps or technical features – your choice depends on your attitude towards risk, and how often you crash.</p>\n<p>Body armour is less relevant if you are riding cross-country, because you’re less likely to have the same high-impact crashes that enduro and downhill riders collect.</p>\n<p>While wearing body armour can add to your confidence, enabling you to overcome features you may have previously had a mental block about, it’s important to be wary of false confidence, because no body armour can protect you from all incidents.</p>\n<h3>What to look for in MTB body armour</h3>\n<h4>Pad construction</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"D3O Foam\" title=\"1264776895823-wu5v45vw6req-a6c3b7f\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> D3O foam is widely used in body armour, and can be identified by its distinct orange colour.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jeff Jones / BikeRadar</i></span></div>\n<p>Most body armour will feature non-newtonian impact-hardening polymers, such as D3O, which remains pliable when in normal use and hardens up under impact.</p>\n<p>For those living in colder climates, these types of pads have the tendency to be a little stiff for the first half-hour of riding, with body heat needed to loosen them up to a malleable state.</p>\n<h4>Vest material construction</h4>\n<p>The material used for the vest of the armour is important if you want to avoid overheating.</p>\n<p>While the vest needs to be strong to keep pads in place, it’s also important it’s breathable, otherwise it will soon end up smelling like Serrano ham in the summer months.</p>\n<p>Much of the best body armour will use a stretchy mesh vest for moisture wicking.</p>\n<h4>Size and fit</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"front view armour jacket for mountain biking\" title=\"SixSixOne Recon Advanced armour jacket 02\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Body armour vests should be tight-fitting to keep pads in place.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd</i></span></div>\n<p>For the pads to be effective, they need to be held in place over the parts of your body they’re designed to protect.</p>\n<p>A tight fit will reduce the amount of movement from the pads, while making the body armour less obstructive to your movements.</p>\n<p>Most body armour is designed to sit below a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-jerseys/\">mountain bike jersey</a>, so the tighter it is the less obvious it will appear.</p>\n<h4>Protection</h4>\n<p>Not all body armour offers the same protection, with brands creating discipline-specific body armour to cope with varying demands.</p>\n<p>Trail armour is usually the easiest to wear, with less padding and therefore more breathability for longer days in the saddle.</p>\n<p>Enduro armour remains comfortable for riding, but features increased padding, while downhill armour has the biggest focus on protection.</p>\n<p>Some body armour will have more pads than others to protect your ribs, kidneys, hips and coccyx.</p>\n<h4>Weight</h4>\n<p>Weight makes a big difference to how the body armour feels, with heavier items feeling more restrictive to your natural riding position and causing added fatigue.</p>\n<p>The best body armour will feel secure when you’re riding without sacrificing comfort.</p>\n<h4>Certification</h4>\n<p>All body armour sold in the EU is certified to Level 1 or Level 2, which indicates the amount of force the padding can absorb.</p>\n<p>CE Level 1 is rated to transmit a maximum force of 18kN, with no single value exceeding 24kN upon impact.</p>\n<p>CE Level 2 is designed for higher impacts and is rated to transmit a maximum force of 9kN, with no single value exceeding 12kN upon impact.</p>\n<h4>Women’s mountain bike body armour</h4>\n<p>While most body armour is unisex, some brands offer women’s-specific versions of their body armour, featuring a more shapely cut that takes in wider hips, curvier chests and narrower shoulders for a more secure fit.</p>\n<h3>What other protection do I need for mountain
