Among the changes to the F-150 lineup are standard LED lights, a new grille, new wheel designs, and standard Sync 4 infotainment across the range.</p>\n<p>Ford has dropped the naturally aspirated 3.3 L V6 as the entry-level motor, replacing it with a turbocharged 2.7 L V6 EcoBoost. But from our perspective, the most interesting news to come from this update is that there's now no price difference between the best-selling turbocharged 3.5 L V6 EcoBoost engine and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/americas-favorite-truck-goes-hybrid-the-ford-f-150-reviewed/\">the hybrid 3.5L V6 PowerBoost</a>.</p>\n<p>\"We're making hybrid more accessible to our customers, giving them the power of choice by offering it at the same price as the 3.5-liter EcoBoost. This is the latest example of Ford democratizing technology for all truck customers,\" said Andrew Frick, vice president of sales and trucks at Ford Blue, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/03/ford-reorg-prioritizes-evs-keeps-fossil-fuel-vehicles-as-engines-of-cash/\">the division of the company responsible for internal combustion engine-powered vehicles</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968053#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968053&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
