It will come in color options that are similar to the 24-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, which we've heard rumored before. According to the leaker, the keyboard will be the same off-white shade as the bezels, and it will feature full-size function keys and a 1080p webcam.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe machine will have no SD card slot or HDMI port, which, along with the design, will distinguish it from the MacBook Pro models. The ‌MacBook Air‌ will use a next-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> chip, a followup to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a>. It is not expected to be as powerful as the ‌M1‌ Pro and ‌M1‌ Max as it will be aimed at lower-power devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>The upcoming MacBook (Air) will release in the middle of 2022. It will have MagSafe, a 1080p webcam, USB C ports, a 30W power adapter, and no fans. There will be color options similar to the iMac 24. The bezels and keyboard will be an off white with full sized function keys.</p>— Dylan (@dylandkt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1451273740722098177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 21, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nPrior rumors <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/06/m2-macbook-air-to-arrive-in-2022/\">have indicated</a> that the ‌M2‌ chip will have the same number of computing cores (eight) but nine or 10 graphics cores instead of seven or eight. Apple is said to be designing a 30W power adapter for the new machine, and it is said to have no fans inside, much like the current ‌M1‌ ‌MacBook Air‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOther leaks <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/17/macbook-air-2022-notch-design/\">have suggested</a> that the new MacBook will include a notch at the front like the MacBook Pro, which perhaps makes sense if it's going to have a 1080p webcam and MacBook Pro-style design. At the same time, it would be an unusual design choice with white bezels. The ‌MacBook Air‌ may include a mini-LED display, but Dylandkt says that ProMotion technology will not be included. A name change could also potentially be in the works, with Apple allegedly considering just \"MacBook.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRumors suggest the next-generation ‌MacBook Air‌ will be released in mid to late 2022.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dylandkt/\">dylandkt</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/21/macbook-air-2022-details-leaked/\">Next MacBook Air to Feature Off-White Bezels and Keyboard, M2 Chip, USB-C Ports Only, MagSafe, and iMac-Like Colors</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-macbook-air-to-feature-off-white-bezels-and-keyboard-m2-chip-usb-c-ports-only-magsafe-and-imac-like-colors.2318530/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=v93eIz3ddX8:QzHX5u9291E:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=v93eIz3ddX8:QzHX5u9291E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/v93eIz3ddX8\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b6a1a971ca582c8f7b3b6aa687ffd64c8f16ab41aeb32f4131523fd06f013525","category":"Apple"}
