A little over one year on from a crash that nearly took his life, sprinter Fabio Jakobsen took an emotional first victory back in a Grand Tour on stage four. This was to be the Dutchman's race; he went on to win two more stages, the pick of them stage 16 (above), survive the mountains to win the green points jersey, and he leaves Spain back at the top of the sport. <em>Credit: ASO/Photogomezsport</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/fabio-jakobsen-a-story-of-strength-bravery-and-courage\"><em>Read: Fabio Jakobsen – A Story of Strength, Bravery and Courage</em></a></p>\n<div><em></em></div>\n<div><em></em></div>\n<div>\n<em><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/CAuldPhoto-Vuelta-Stage5-4032_1024x1024.jpg?v=1630876071\" /></em>It wasn't all plain sailing for Jakobsen and Deceuninck-Quick-Step. Jasper Philipsen and his Alpecin-Fenix lead-out train ran him close and the Belgian took two stages of his own. He withdrew after stage 10 but completed the Grand Tour hat-trick for his squad. <em>Credit: Chris Auld</em>\n</div>\n<div><em></em></div>\n<div><em><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/20211808VUE027-Photogomezsport_1024x1024.jpg?v=1630876336\" /></em></div>\n<div>Nor was it straightforward for the rest of the bunch.
