And that’s with one fewer week than last year’s quarter—so all around a strong performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gains were due to strong iPhone sales, which posted a 6 percent increase, and Services, which posted a 14 percent gain for a record $23 billion in sales. Apple bumped the price of Apple TV+ to $9.99 during the quarter, a 40 percent increase. Mac sales also held their own with an extremely small increase but were mostly flat following <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1501590/apple-q1-2023-loss-iphone-mac-sales.html\">a massive decline last year</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again, iPad sales were down, dropping 25 percent over last year. Apple hasn’t introduced a new iPad model in more than a year, though a new M3 iPad Pro and larger iPad Air are expected to arrive in March.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wearables, which includes AirPods, Apple Watch, and HomePod, was also down about 8 percent, but the category should get a boost in quarter two with the launch of Apple Vision Pro. Apple has reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2214079/vision-pro-preorder-weekend-sales-180000-units-report.html\">sold some 200,000 of the next-gen headsets</a> and is planning a massive launch, with early Apple Store hours and in-store demos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Cook noted that Apple’s installed base of active devices has surpassed 2.2 billion, an all-time high. The company will hold an earnings call with investors at 5pm ET. We will update this article with any pertinent information.</p>\n\nApple Inc</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d8d88783cf9f89d61550f2a0e58dbd373ef62535c89ccfc31e8997043b27f827","category":"Apple"}
