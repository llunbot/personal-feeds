Kaplan, a lawyer for Ms. Carroll, asked the \njury in a crisp and methodical summation to award her client at \nleast $24 million to help Ms. Carroll repair her reputation and to \ncompensate her for the emotional harm Mr. Trump had inflicted with \nhis attacks. </p>\n\n<p>Ms. Kaplan also asked the jury to award substantial punitive \ndamages to deter Mr. Trump from continuing to attack Ms. Carroll. \nMs. Kaplan did not specify an amount, but she noted that Mr. \nTrump, in an excerpt from a video deposition played for the jury, \nestimated that his brand alone was worth “maybe $10 billion” and \nthat he placed the value of various of his real estate properties \nat $14 billion. </p>\n\n<p>“Donald Trump is worth billions of dollars,” Ms. Kaplan told \nthe jury. </p>\n\n<p>“The law says you can consider Donald Trump’s wealth as well as \nhis malicious and spiteful continuing conduct in making that \nassessment,” Ms. Kaplan said, adding, “Now is the time to make him \npay for it, and now is the time to make him pay dearly.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It must have been delicious using Trump’s own absurd lies about his wealth against him.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/26/trump-carroll-83-million\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ab2a6892a695b2cb7f230a764c9aabdf76585cdb93fe1ed96eefee2d92e6ccdd","category":"Tech"}
