Years later, Sweeney was checking ‌Find My‌, and as the Mac was still connected to his <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a> account, it showed him the location where the thief lived.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>This feature is super creepy surveillance tech and shouldn’t exist. Years ago, a kid stole a Mac laptop out of my car. Years later, I was checking out Find My and it showed a map with the house where the kid who stole my Mac lived. WTF Apple? How is that okay?!</p>— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1818249443449225726?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 30, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nSweeney's take is curious, because providing the location of a lost or stolen device is exactly what the ‌Find My‌ service is meant to do. Apple devices remain tied to a user's account if not removed, a feature that is meant to thwart theft.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>A lot of people are saying this here.
