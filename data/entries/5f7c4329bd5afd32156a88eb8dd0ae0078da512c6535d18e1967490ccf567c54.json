{"title":"The Microsoft Event Was In-Person","link":"https://twitter.com/caro_milanesi/status/1440709608608202756","date":1632440508000,"content":"\n<p>Carolina Milanesi, on Twitter:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I had the opportunity to see the new @surface devices live … and I\nam so glad I did.</p>\n\n<p>Holding #SurfaceDuo in my hand, seeing the clever case that\nsecures the #SurfacePen that looks like a finish rather than a\ncase not adding any thickness, the fluidity of the screen and\nthe clever gaming controls…. Very much looking forward to giving\nit a spin!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Amen to this enthusiasm for seeing the product introduction live. I get it why Apple did not hold an in-person press event last week — iPhone events are <em>huge</em>, and while I think small events can safely be held in person now, there’s no practical way to shrink the iPhone event.</p>\n\n<p>I miss having hands-on time with new devices as soon as keynotes end. You pick up on things immediately: that something is heavier or lighter than you expected. That certain colors or finishes look different. Remember the Jet Black iPhone 7? You <em>had</em> to see it in person to understand how it looked. And I miss in-person briefings, both official ones and unofficial. In-person communication simply cannot be beaten for conveying subtlety.</p>\n\n<p>Product reviews are hampered too. With in-person Apple events, most reviewers get kit in the hours after the keynote ends. With virtual Apple events, the kit ships for delivery the next day. An extra day makes a big difference when the review embargo drops just one week after the event.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/23/microsoft-event-was-in-person\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5f7c4329bd5afd32156a88eb8dd0ae0078da512c6535d18e1967490ccf567c54","category":"Tech"}
