On Tuesday, he got his first look at dust grains returned by NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission.</p>\n<p>Because they want to be sure, members of the OSIRIS-REx science team will wipe some of the dust from the asteroid sample canister and send it to a laboratory for analysis. But there's little question the dust grains visible immediately after scientists opened the lid to the canister are from asteroid Bennu, where the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft captured rocks during a touch-and-go landing in 2020.</p>\n<p>The spacecraft completed its round-trip journey to asteroid Bennu with a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/09/nasa-spacecraft-returns-to-earth-with-pieces-of-an-asteroid/\">near-bullseye landing</a> of its sample return capsule Sunday morning in Utah. The OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer) mothership released the capsule to plunge into the atmosphere while it fired its thrusters to maneuver on a trajectory to head back into the Solar System for an extended mission to visit another asteroid.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971340#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971340&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b317394961c98abcb55477be56132c02b48a1ff28e3e4423a01f37c7a7257929","category":"Tech"}
