The Act of Parliament allows the British Home Office to force technology companies to disable security features like end-to-end encryption without telling the public. The IPA also enables storage of internet browsing records and authorises the bulk collection of personal data in the UK. Due to the secrecy surrounding these demands, little is known about how many have been issued and complied with.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCurrently, this process involves independent oversight via a review process and tech companies can appeal before having to comply. Under the proposed update to the IPA, disabling security features without informing the public would have to be immediate. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe UK government started an eight-week consultation process on the proposed amendments to the IPA and Apple has submitted a nine-page-long document condemning many of the changes. The company opposes the requirement to inform the Home Office of any changes to product security features before they are released, the requirement for non-UK-based companies to comply with changes that would affect their product globally, and having to take action immediately if a notice to disable or block a feature is received from the Home Office without review or an appeals process.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple added that it would not make changes to security features specifically for one country that would weaken a product for all users. Some changes would require issuing a software update so could not be made secretly. The proposals \"constitute a serious and direct threat to data security and information privacy\" that would affect people outside the UK.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple, WhatsApp, and Signal also oppose a clause in the Online Safety Bill allowing the communications regulator to require companies to install technology to scan for child-abuse material in encrypted messaging apps and other services. Signal has threatened to leave the UK over the matter.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/20/apple-threatens-to-pull-facetime-and-imessage-uk/\">Apple Threatens to Pull FaceTime and iMessage in the UK Over Proposed Surveillance Legislation Changes</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-threatens-to-pull-facetime-and-imessage-in-the-uk-over-proposed-surveillance-legislation-changes.2396404/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"016763f8c9545fbb2e692a604ce99bd9c58e8c042e3727eab6f3f3acdcb5c98d","category":"Apple"}
