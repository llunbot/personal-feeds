{"title":"Apple TV+, Arcade, and News+ just got massive price hikes","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2116172/apple-tv-arcade-news-plus-price-hikes-october-2023.html","date":1698246448000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead of its “Scary Fast” Mac event next week. Apple dropped another surprise this morning, and this one isn’t so exciting. According to Apple’s site, the price for three of its services are going up–including Apple TV+.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple hasn’t officially announced the pricing changes, but the sites for Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and Apple News+ now list new monthly prices that are significantly higher than they were before:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Apple TV+:</strong> $9.99/£8.99 (previously $6.99/£6.99)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Apple Arcade:</strong> $6.99/£6.99 (previously $4.99/£4.99)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Apple News+:</strong> $12.99/£12.99) (previously $9.99/£9.99))</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The price of the Apple One bundles have also increased to reflect the change and some additional savings over the new prices:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Individual:</strong> $19.95/£18.95 (previously $16.99/£16.99)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Family:</strong> $25.95/£24.95 (previously $22.95/£22.95)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Premier:</strong> $37.95/£36.95 (previously $32.95/£32.95)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The new prices, which affect the U.S., U.K., and many other countries, represent the largest price increases for Apple’s services. Since its November 2019 launch, Apple TV+ has doubled in price, following a price hike from $4.99 to $6.99 last October. Apple Music increased from $9.99 a month to $10.99 a month last October as well, but doesn’t appear to be part of this latest round of price hikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this month, Netflix announced it was increasing the price of its basic plan from $9.99 to $11.99 a month and raising its monthly premium plan from $19.99 to $22.99.</p>\n\nApple TV</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0c15344cec7442f795034d16a1f24fbb98f7010422b21a876bce3d5b0078de5a","category":"Apple"}
