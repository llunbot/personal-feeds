If you live anywhere like us (Bristol, in the south-west of England, if you were wondering), the clocks have now changed, the roads and trails are a carpet of fallen leaves, and there’s a distinct chill in the air.</p>\n<p>For an increasing number of riders, winter riding season is now <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/beginners-guide-to-indoor-training-all-you-need-to-get-started/\">indoor cycling</a> season.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say there’s no joy in riding on a crisp, clear winter’s day – it can be <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/10-reasons-to-love-winter-cycling/\">one of our favourite times of the year</a> – but with short days, long nights and inclement weather, indoor training is a way for many riders to keep the pedals turning and fitness up.</p>\n<p>Indoor training is also more interactive than ever, thanks to the rise of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-smart-trainer/\">smart trainers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-indoor-cycling-apps/\">indoor cycling apps</a>. You can throw yourself into a structured training plan, pedal through virtual worlds or compete against other riders.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, we’re starting a new mini-series of the BikeRadar Podcast, dedicated to indoor training. Over four episodes, we’ll help you get the most out of indoor training this winter, covering setup tips, how to choose a smart trainer, coaching advice and plenty more.</p>\n<p>For the first episode, BikeRadar’s editor-in-chief, George Scott, is joined by senior technical writer, Simon Bromley.</p>\n<p>The pair dive straight into what you need to get started (and what you don’t), chat through their personal training setups, and share a few tips and tricks for using a smart trainer.</p>\n<hr /><h2>Subscribe to the BikeRadar Podcast</h2>\n<p>You can use the player at the top to listen to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/bikeradar-podcast/\">BikeRadar Podcast</a> – and make sure you subscribe via <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-bikeradar-podcast/id1461106709\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/6aLvE13Bge7WC7AWbiR3LS\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify</a> or your chosen podcast provider, so you don’t miss a future episode.</p>\n<p>The BikeRadar Podcast takes you to the heart of the issues that matter to bike riders, whether you’re a roadie, mountain biker, gravel rider or commuter.</p>\n<p>From the latest tech news, reviews and debates, to interviews with the biggest and most interesting personalities in cycling, the podcast is your direct line into the BikeRadar team.</p>\n<p></p>","author":"BikeRadar","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"7a2972ff0af8303d880125a716385e4b012815093c6542e5a200ce687412c007","category":"Cycling"}
