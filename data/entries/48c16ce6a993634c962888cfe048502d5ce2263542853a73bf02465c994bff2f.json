This starts with a new 'progressive' geometry – phrasing that tends to be used more in mountain bikes, something which Trek certainly have some experience in – that means adding 2cm to the front-center through longer top tubes and reaches, with shorter-reach stems and bars to make up for it, as well as longer chainstays.</p>\n<p>That, alongside the clearance for 700×45mm or 27.5×2.1in tyres on all the bikes is designed to create a speedy and agile, yet stable and controlled ride.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/09/trek_checkpoint_2022_geometry.png?itok=tbO3aAcb\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<h3>Trek Checkpoint ALR 2022 spec, weight and pricing</h3>\n<p>The most accessible model of the range is the Checkpoint ALR 5, it's built with a 300 Series Alpha aluminium frame and carbon fork that brings the weight to a claimed 9.75kg and Trek labels it as 'the utility-focussed bike in the line-up' with plenty of mounts for mudguards, bags, bottles and racks and internal cable routing.</p>\n<p>As you'd expect it's finished off with heaps of Bontrager kit including tubeless-ready Paradigm SL wheels with CenterLock flat-mount disc brakes and comes equipped with a Shimano GRX RX600 groupset and an 11-speed Shimano 105 cassette.</p>\n<p>Costing £2,250 it's still not cheap but Trek notes it's 'more than capable' of taking on commutes, adventure rides and races.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Buy the <a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/gb/en_GB/bikes/road-bikes/gravel-bikes/checkpoint/checkpoint-alr/checkpoint-alr-5/p/35172/?colorCode=white_black\" target=\"_blank\">Trek Checkpoint ALR 5</a> now from <a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/gb/en_GB/bikes/road-bikes/gravel-bikes/checkpoint/checkpoint-alr/checkpoint-alr-5/p/35172/?colorCode=white_black\" target=\"_blank\">trekbikes.com</a></strong></em></p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/10143/trek-checkpoint-2022-images#11\"><p><span>Image 12 of</span> 64</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/09/checkpointalr5_22_35172_a_primary.png?itok=4nGAuN_p\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 12 of </span>64</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Trek Checkpoint SL 2022 spec, weight and pricing</h3>\n<p>Next up is the Checkpoint SL, of which there are a three: SL 5, SL 6 eTap and SL 7 eTap.</p>\n<p>Formerly the top of the Checkpoint range, the SL bikes are carbon-framed and now marketed as the most adventure-ready of the bunch with plenty of mounts, internal cable routing and internal tool storage in the down tube as well as terrain-smoothing features including the IsoSpeed decoupler that allows for extra seat tube movement to dampen rougher surfaces and dropper post compatibility.</p>\n<p>They're all built with Trek's 500 Series OCLV Carbon – OCLV being <a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/gb/en_GB/inside_trek/oclv_carbon/\" target=\"_blank\">Optimum Compaction Low-Void</a> and involving a handy lifetime warranty – and differ when it comes to componentry.</p>\n<p>The SL 5 has the same specifications as the ALR 5 with those Paradigm SL wheels and Shimano GRX groupset, weighs only slightly less at a claimed 9.65kg and will set you back a good amount more at £3,200.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Buy the <a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/gb/en_GB/bikes/road-bikes/gravel-bikes/checkpoint/checkpoint-sl-5/p/35169/?colorCode=grey_greydark\" target=\"_blank\">Trek Checkpoint SL 5</a> now from <a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/gb/en_GB/bikes/road-bikes/gravel-bikes/checkpoint/checkpoint-sl-5/p/35169/?colorCode=grey_greydark\" target=\"_blank\">trekbikes.com</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>The SL 6 eTap is kitted out with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sram/9405/sram-rival-etap-axs\" target=\"_self\">SRAM's new wireless 1×12 Rival eTap AXS groupset</a> and has Bontrager Paradigm Comp 25 wheels.

They also all come with 2× setups.</p>\n<p>While the need for speed takes over it still has mounts for bags and mudguards – though not racks – and internal storage in the down tube.</p>\n<p>The SLR also boasts a new level of IsoSpeed technology. While the SL had seat tube IsoSpeed, here you've got a new top tube IsoSpeed, meaning it goes a step further on damping bumps by adding even more movement where the seat and top tubes meet. A similar system is used on the Madone SLR and Domane SLR bikes, however in those instances it is an adjustable IsoSpeed whereas the Checkpoint features a non-adjustable version that's said to minimise weight and maximises compliance.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/10097/cyclist-magazine-podcast-episode-39-cherie-pridham\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast Episode 39 - Cherie Pridham</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/sponsored/9297/cyclist-s-31-inspirational-women-no7-cherie-pridham\">Cyclist’s 31 Inspirational Women No7: Cherie Pridham</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9537/the-directors-cut-israel-start-up-nation-ds-cherie-pridham-profile\">The director's cut: Israel Start-Up Nation DS Cherie Pridham profile</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nThere are another four bikes in the SLR umbrella: SLR 6 eTap, SLR 7, SLR 7 eTap and SLR 9 eTap.</p>\n<p>The SLR 6 eTap and both SLR 7s come with Bontrager Aeolus Pro 3V OCLV Carbon wheels, though the SLR 6 eTap has the wireless 2×12 SRAM Rival eTap AXS groupset while the SLR 7 is equipped with a 2×11 Shimano GRX mechanical groupset and the SLR 7 eTap has the wireless 2×12 SRAM Force eTap AXS.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/10143/trek-checkpoint-2022-images#63\"><p><span>Image 64 of</span> 64</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/09/checkpointslr9etap_22_35296_b_primary.png?itok=oGT8eHpk\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 64 of </span>64</p>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>Weight-wise the SLR 6 eTap is actually lighter than the SLR 7, with Trek claiming their weights at 8.65kg and 8.81kg respectively though the price of the 6 is set at £6,450 to the 7's £7,650.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Buy the <a href=\"https://www.leisurelakesbikes.com/bikes/gravel-bikes/trek-checkpoint-slr-6-etap-gravel-bike-2022-radioactive-coral__371231\" target=\"_blank\">Trek Checkpoint SLR 6 eTap</a> from <a href=\"https://www.leisurelakesbikes.com/bikes/gravel-bikes/trek-checkpoint-slr-6-etap-gravel-bike-2022-radioactive-coral__371231\" target=\"_blank\">leisurelakesbikes.com</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/gb/en_GB/bikes/road-bikes/gravel-bikes/checkpoint/checkpoint-slr/checkpoint-slr-7/p/35294/?colorCode=black_greendark\" target=\"_blank\">Trek Checkpoint SLR 7</a> now from <a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/gb/en_GB/bikes/road-bikes/gravel-bikes/checkpoint/checkpoint-slr/checkpoint-slr-7/p/35294/?colorCode=black_greendark\" target=\"_blank\">trekbikes.com</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>Meanwhile the SLR 7 eTap is said to be 8.45kg and costs £7,800.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Buy the <a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/gb/en_GB/bikes/road-bikes/gravel-bikes/checkpoint/checkpoint-slr/checkpoint-slr-7-etap/p/35295/?colorCode=black_greendark\" target=\"_blank\">Trek Checkpoint SLR 7 eTap</a> now from <a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/gb/en_GB/bikes/road-bikes/gravel-bikes/checkpoint/checkpoint-slr/checkpoint-slr-7-etap/p/35295/?colorCode=black_greendark\" target=\"_blank\">trekbikes.com</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>Top of the top is the SLR 9 eTap, which has SRAM's highest groupset in the wireless 2x12 Red eTap AXS with a 10-44t cassette.
