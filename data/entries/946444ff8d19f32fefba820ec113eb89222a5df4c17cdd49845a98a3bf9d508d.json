{"title":"For the empire: Please take the grand Ars Technica 2021 Reader Survey","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818467","date":1638889554000,"content":"<div>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ars-survey.jpg\" />\n      <p>(credit: Aurich Lawson / Thinkstock)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>It's that time of year again—holiday decorations festoon the lampposts and store windows, the smell of pumpkin spice lattes pervades the air, and the chill of winter has settled in (unless you live in Houston, where <a href=\"https://spacecityweather.com/warmth-to-soon-return-but-the-weekend-will-feel-decidedly-more-winter-like/\">it's going to be in the mid-80s this week</a> because this city is a miserable swamp). As we wrap up 2021 and gird our loins for whatever fresh hell 2022 is preparing to fling at us, the Ars crew could really use your help with something: if you have a few minutes, would you please fill out <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ArsTechnica\">the Ars Technica 2021 Reader Survey</a>?</p>\n<p>It's been a couple of years since we last did one of these, and they're incredibly useful for helping us to understand how you all interact with Ars and what you'd like for us to do better. In fact, as Ars Editor-in-Chief Ken Fisher has mentioned in surveys past, out of all the ways we have to get feedback from our readers, surveys like this are the most important—it's typically the hardest of hard-core Ars readers who take them, and that means we know the responses you give come directly from our most engaged and informed audience. And you're exactly who we want to hear from.</p>\n<p>This year's survey should take maybe 10 minutes to fill out. We have several free-form questions this time (all of which are optional) that give y'all the opportunity to weigh in on what your favorite or least favorite stories have been over the past year or two, as well as asking what kind of coverage you'd like to see more of. The responses gathered will only be examined in aggregate, with no personally identifying information attached, and we will <em>never</em> sell or share this data with anyone else.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818467#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818467&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Lee Hutchinson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"946444ff8d19f32fefba820ec113eb89222a5df4c17cdd49845a98a3bf9d508d","category":"Tech"}
