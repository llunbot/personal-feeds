{"title":"★ Regarding — and, Well, Against — Substack","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/regarding_and_well_against_substack","date":1732159993000,"content":"\n<p>Anil Dash, “<a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2024/11/19/dont-call-it-a-substack/\">Don’t Call It a Substack</a>”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We constrain our imaginations when we subordinate our creations to\nnames owned by fascist tycoons. Imagine the author of a book\ntelling people to “read my Amazon”. A great director trying to\npromote their film by saying “click on my Max”. That’s how much\nthey’ve pickled your brain when you refer to your own work and\nyour own voice within the context of their walled garden. There is\nno such thing as “my Substack”, there is only your writing, and a\nforever fight against the world of pure enshittification.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am upset by the above, but only insofar as I’m jealous that I had never thought to make the analogy to an author telling people to “read my Amazon”. A publication on Substack is no more “a Substack” than a blog on WordPress is “a WordPress”. It’s really quite a nifty — but devious — trick that Substack has pulled to make this parlance a thing.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Substack is, just as a reminder, a political project made by\nextremists with a goal of normalizing a radical, hateful agenda by\nco-opting well-intentioned creators’ work in service of\ncross-promoting attacks on the vulnerable. You don’t have to take\nmy word for it; Substack’s CEO explicitly said they won’t ban\nsomeone who is explicitly spouting hate, and when confronted with\nthe rampant white supremacist propaganda that they are profiting\nfrom on their site, they took down... four of the Nazis. Four.\nThere are countless more now, and they want to use your email\nnewsletter to cross-promote that content and legitimize it. Nobody\ncan ban the hateful content site if your nice little newsletter is\non there, too, and your musings for your subscribers are all the\ncover they need.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I know quite a few people whose opinions I admire who feel the same way as Dash here. I’ll disagree. I think Substack sees itself as a publishing tool and platform. They’re not here to promote any particular side. It makes no more sense for them to refuse to publish someone for being too right-wing than it would for WordPress or Medium or, say, GitHub or YouTube. Substack, I think, sees itself like that.</p>\n\n<p>You might disagree. Like I said, I know a bunch of good, smart people who see Substack like Dash does, and refuse to pay for any publication on Substack’s platform because of their “<em>Hey we’re just a neutral publishing platform, not an editor, let alone a censor</em>” stance. What I can say, personally, is that I read and pay for several publications on Substack, and for the last few weeks I’ve tried using their iOS app (more on this in a moment), and I’ve never once seen a whiff of anything even vaguely right-wing, let alone hateful. Not a whiff. If it’s there, I never see it. If I never see it, I don’t care.<sup><a href=\"#fn1-2024-11-20\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>What I object to isn’t their laissez faire approach to who they allow to publish on their platform, but rather <em>how</em> they present all publications. People do call the publications on Substack “Substacks”. And Substack publications do all look the same, most of them right down to that telltale serif typeface, <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Spectral\">Spectral</a>,<sup><a href=\"#fn2-2024-11-20\">2</a></sup> which is kerned so loosely it looks like teeth in need of orthodontia. It’s not an ugly font, per se, but it is very distinctive, which contributes, I think significantly, to the blurring of the branding line between Substack publications as discrete standalone independent entities or as mere sections under “Substack” as an umbrella publication.</p>\n\n<p>Substack, very deliberately, has from the get-go tried to have it both ways. They <em>say</em> that publications on their platform are independent voices and brands. But they present them all as parts of Substack. They all look alike, and they all look like “Substack”. I really don’t get why any writer trying to establish themselves independently would farm out their own <em>brand</em> this way. It’s the illusion of independence.</p>\n\n<p>I absolutely despise that a Substack publication’s home page is, typically, nothing more than a sign-up field for your email address to get the publication by email, and a small “No thanks” link to actually read the damn thing. Half the time when I see that page, I just close the tab out of spite. In what world is “No thanks” a good link to convey the meaning “Let me read the thing I came here to read”?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/substack/id1581650857\">Substack’s app</a>, along with <a href=\"https://substack.com/\">the company’s home page</a>, defaults to presenting itself as a Twitter-like short-form posting platform. As if what we need right now is <em>another</em> Twitter-like platform. But especially: why would anyone want to participate in a social platform tied to one specific publishing platform? It doesn’t make any sense to me, as a reader, nor do I see the appeal to writers on the platform. It only makes sense strategically from Substack’s own perspective. If, as a writer, your feedback and social interaction with your audience is tied to Substack’s own social graph, your publication is tied to Substack, too. It’s so transparently a lock-in play that it’s almost hard to object to it. It’s right there on the tin. But it’s not hard at all to just not use it.</p>\n\n<p>Substack no longer even hosts a majority of the newsletter-style writers I subscribe to. <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/why-platformer-is-leaving-substack/\">Casey Newton moved Platformer</a> from Substack to <a href=\"https://ghost.org/\">Ghost</a> in January. Craig Calcaterra moved his excellent baseball-focused-but-with-heavy-dashes-of-politics-and-pop-culture <a href=\"https://cupofcoffee.beehiiv.com/\">Cup of Coffee</a> <a href=\"https://cupofcoffee.substack.com/p/cup-of-coffee-has-moved-to-beehiiv\">from Substack to Beehiiv</a> in January as well.<sup><a href=\"#fn3-2024-11-20\">3</a></sup> Molly White runs <a href=\"https://www.citationneeded.news/\">Citation Needed</a> on Ghost. My newest paid subscription is to CNN expat Oliver Darcy’s new media-industry focused <a href=\"https://www.status.news/\">Status</a>, for which he chose Beehiiv. And of course there’s my friend and <a href=\"https://dithering.fm/\">Dithering</a> co-host Ben Thompson, whose <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/\">Stratechery</a>, running on his own platform <a href=\"https://passport.online/\">Passport</a>, not only long predates Substack <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/16/substack-sinocism-launch/\">but served as their model to replicate</a>. (Substack’s pitch deck was “Stratechery in a box.”) All of these sites look distinctive, with their own brand. All of them offer much better subscription and delivery management interfaces than Substack.</p>\n\n<p>My advice to any writer looking to start a new site based on the newsletter model would be to consider Substack <em>last</em>, not first. Not because Substack is a Nazi bar, which I don’t think it is at all, but simply because there are clearly better options, and the company’s long term goal is clearly platform lock-in.</p>\n\n<div>\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li>\n<p>I feel the same way about social media platforms. Are there people I find objectionable on Mastodon, Bluesky, Instagram, and Threads? Definitely. On YouTube? Even more definitely. Do I care? No, because I tend never to see their posts, and when one pops up, I can block or mute them, and I never see them again. That’s in contrast with X, the former Twitter, where the top replies to many posts are from first class shitbird trolls. More and more I simply find X an unpleasant place to devote any of my attention, and so I go there less and less. I don’t eat at restaurants whose food I dislike, and the food at X tastes bad and is only getting worse. <a href=\"#fnr1-2024-11-20\">↩︎︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n\n<li>\n<p>A free Google font, which says something about Substack. <a href=\"#fnr2-2024-11-20\">↩︎︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>Coincidentally, <a href=\"https://cupofcoffee.beehiiv.com/p/cup-of-coffee-november-21-2024\">Calcaterra is moving Cup of Coffee from Beehiiv to Ghost</a> this coming week.
