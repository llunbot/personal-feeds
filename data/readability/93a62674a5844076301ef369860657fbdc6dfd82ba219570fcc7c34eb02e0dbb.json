Straight tubes with as few curves at the joints as possible plus minimal overlap of carbon fiber sheets saves a lot of weight. It also lets them use longer sheets and more continuous fibers running throughout the frame, which maintains the necessary strength and durability.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06143848/2022-specialized-crux-S-works-gravel-race-bike-details-5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06143848/2022-specialized-crux-S-works-gravel-race-bike-details-5.jpg\" alt=\"frame details on new specialized crux s-works gravel bike\" width=\"1400\" height=\"933\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06143848/2022-specialized-crux-S-works-gravel-race-bike-details-5.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06143848/2022-specialized-crux-S-works-gravel-race-bike-details-5-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06143848/2022-specialized-crux-S-works-gravel-race-bike-details-5-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06143848/2022-specialized-crux-S-works-gravel-race-bike-details-5-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06143848/2022-specialized-crux-S-works-gravel-race-bike-details-5-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06143832/2022-specialized-crux-S-works-gravel-race-bike-details-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06143832/2022-specialized-crux-S-works-gravel-race-bike-details-2.jpg\" alt=\"frame details on new specialized crux s-works gravel bike\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06143832/2022-specialized-crux-S-works-gravel-race-bike-details-2.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06143832/2022-specialized-crux-S-works-gravel-race-bike-details-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06143832/2022-specialized-crux-S-works-gravel-race-bike-details-2-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06143832/2022-specialized-crux-S-works-gravel-race-bike-details-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06143832/2022-specialized-crux-S-works-gravel-race-bike-details-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06143832/2022-specialized-crux-S-works-gravel-race-bike-details-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>They say the layup alone saves 150g, and then the tube shapes do even more.
