Choosing a kid’s bike helmet that fits well and, let’s be honest, looks and feels good enough that they’re willing to keep it on even when you’re not looking, is critically important. Here, our test crew at Bikerumor is sharing the helmets that our kiddos wear as they come along on our adventures.</p><h3><span>&nbsp;BEST OVERALL: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=b5770911-39dc-46ac-ba0f-b49dbb30c5c7&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2FStore%2Fcatalog%2Fsearch.jsp%3Fs%3Du%26q%3Dkali%2Bchakra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kali Chakra Child</a><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FKali-Chakra-Youth-Pixel-Helmet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">/</a><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FKali-Chakra-Youth-Pixel-Helmet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Youth Helmets&nbsp;</a></span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01154311/kali-chakra-youth-child-bike-helmets.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01154311/kali-chakra-youth-child-bike-helmets.jpg\" alt=\"kali youth kids mountain bike helmets\" width=\"1198\" height=\"623\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01154311/kali-chakra-youth-child-bike-helmets.jpg 1198w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01154311/kali-chakra-youth-child-bike-helmets-297x154.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01154311/kali-chakra-youth-child-bike-helmets-800x416.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01154311/kali-chakra-youth-child-bike-helmets-120x62.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01154311/kali-chakra-youth-child-bike-helmets-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1198px) 100vw, 1198px\"></a></p><p>We love the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=b5770911-39dc-46ac-ba0f-b49dbb30c5c7&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2FStore%2Fcatalog%2Fsearch.jsp%3Fs%3Du%26q%3Dkali%2Bchakra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chakra Child</a> and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FKali-Chakra-Youth-Pixel-Helmet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Youth helmets</a> from Kali for a few reasons, but we’ll get the basic one out of the way first: They just look cool. Not only are there plenty of colors available, but Kali also does limited-run artist collaborations, so you can get an incredibly unique helmet that helps your kid stand out in a crowd.</p><p>From a safety standpoint, Kali’s hard to beat, and these take age and size into consideration with the features. The Child versions have an integrated visor, and the XS uses an easier elastic retention strap. The Youth helmets upgrade to an adjustable dial-fit that allows us to ensure a properly fitting helmet, with a breakaway visor. The extended rear coverage on all sizes is not only great for protection on the trails, it’s also more comfortable for kiddos who are stuck sitting in the trailer while we get our miles in.</p><p>We also appreciate that the Youth helmet goes a bit bigger than most helmets for kids, offering an option for kids six and up who might still need a smaller helmet. And there’s a <em>Plus</em> model that uses some of Kali’s more advanced protective materials for more aggressive little riders.</p><ul><li>Size: Kali Chakra Child: XS 46-48 CM, S 48-54 CM / Youth: One Size 52-57 CM</li><li>Material: Composite Fusion in-mold construction</li><li>Weight: 245 grams for XS</li><li>Color: Kali Chakra Child: 8 options plus limited run artist series options / Youth: 5 options plus limited run artist series options</li><li>MSRP: Kali Chakra Child $40 / Youth $50 / Youth Plus $60</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Great price for such a feature-rich helmet, tons of colors<br><strong>CONS</strong>: None, really.<br></p><h3><span>&nbsp;RUNNER UP: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F129365%2Fgiro-scamp-mips-bike-helmet-kids\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Giro Youth Scamp MIPS Bike Helmet&nbsp;</a></span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09083440/Giro-Youth-Scamp-Bike-Helmet-best-children-bike-helmet.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09083440/Giro-Youth-Scamp-Bike-Helmet-best-children-bike-helmet.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09083440/Giro-Youth-Scamp-Bike-Helmet-best-children-bike-helmet.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09083440/Giro-Youth-Scamp-Bike-Helmet-best-children-bike-helmet-297x149.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09083440/Giro-Youth-Scamp-Bike-Helmet-best-children-bike-helmet-800x400.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09083440/Giro-Youth-Scamp-Bike-Helmet-best-children-bike-helmet-120x60.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09083440/Giro-Youth-Scamp-Bike-Helmet-best-children-bike-helmet-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F129365%2Fgiro-scamp-mips-bike-helmet-kids\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Giro Scamp</a> is one of very few kids’ helmets to use MIPS (Multi-Directional Impact Protection System) technology, yet it still comes in at a reasonable price point.

The helmet even includes Leatt’s 360° Turbine rotational impact protection system, their excellent alternative to MIPS. The weight is a hefty 960 grams, but it is a lot of helmet, so that’s actually quite a reasonable weight. We appreciate that the inner liner can be removed and is machine-washable, and we love that if you are planning a more extreme day on the trails, this helmet is compatible with a neck brace for more protection.</p><p>The one issue we’ve noticed is that sizing is a bit tricky compared to other Leatt helmets, so it’d actually be great to be able to try on to confirm fit. This helmet doesn’t have the dial adjustments of conventional MTB helmets, meaning finding the right size is important. It’s both CPSC and ASTM-certified, since it is a downhill helmet (more on that in the FAQ below).<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/06/30/review-top-end-leatt-8-0-dh-versus-budget-friendly-leatt-1-0-dh-helmet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Read our review of the adult size right here.</a></p><ul><li>Size: XXS (51 – 52cm), XS (53 – 54cm), S (55 – 56cm)</li><li>Material: Outer hard shell, EPS foam inner</li><li>Color: Red or black</li><li>MSRP: $99</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Ultimate in protection for young MTBers<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Not adjustable<br></p><h3><span>&nbsp;BEST KIDS HELMET ADD-ON: <a href=\"https://cratoni.com/en/produkt/crash-sensor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cratoni C-Safe crash sensor&nbsp;</a></span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09083444/cratoni-crash-sensor-best-children-bike-helmet.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09083444/cratoni-crash-sensor-best-children-bike-helmet.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09083444/cratoni-crash-sensor-best-children-bike-helmet.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09083444/cratoni-crash-sensor-best-children-bike-helmet-297x149.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09083444/cratoni-crash-sensor-best-children-bike-helmet-800x400.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09083444/cratoni-crash-sensor-best-children-bike-helmet-120x60.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09083444/cratoni-crash-sensor-best-children-bike-helmet-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p>If your kid rides without you, you may want to add a crash sensor to their helmet.

Specialized</p></div><h2>Buyer’s Guide For Children’s Bike Helmets</h2><p><strong>Consider usage when choosing the style</strong>. If your kiddo is already seriously into mountain biking and shreds the trails at speeds that stress you out, consider a full-face MTB helmet. But if your big rides are just down the road to school, a “normal” helmet will work just fine. It’s not just about the style though: Shape matters in some cases. The shape should have a round back that doesn’t protrude too far rearward if you’re going to be sitting them in a child trailer. Otherwise, the helmet will be pushing their head forward and down, which is uncomfortable at best.</p><p><strong>Check your kiddo’s head size</strong>. Use a soft tape measure to get an accurate measurement of your child’s head diameter in centimeters at the widest point, and reference that against the sizing. If he or she is right between sizes, you may need to try before you buy to see which is more comfortable. (From a cost-saving perspective, obviously sizing up so your child can grow into it is great, but if that bigger size can’t be dialed in to fit properly, then it’s not a good choice.)</p><p><strong>Look for safety ratings.</strong> Make sure the helmet has a CPSC rating from the <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/safety-education/safety-guides/sports-fitness-and-recreation-bicycles/which-helmet-which-activity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Consumer Product Safety Commission</a>. For downhill or BMX, also look for the ASTM F1952 safety rating. (For more on what makes a helmet safe, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/10/27/how-to-choose-a-bike-helmet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we have an explainer article here</a>.)</p><p><strong>Remember 2V1 for fit</strong>. When trying a helmet on, make sure it can be adjusted for a 2V1 fit: 2 fingers from eyebrow to the helmet, a clean V shape around the ears with the straps, and 1 finger under the chin for the strap. Some children’s helmets are so simple that they become impossible to adjust, so your child may not fit properly in the first helmet you try.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103247/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-14.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103247/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103247/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-14.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103247/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-14-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103247/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-14-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103247/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-14-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103247/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-14-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Children’s Bike Helmets</h2><p><strong>Why not buy a cheap one at a big box store?</strong><br>Simply put, the quality of a cheap children’s helmet is a bit dubious. Technically, all helmets sold after 1999 in the US are required to have a CPSC rating, but the construction is often lower quality than the helmets we’ve listed here. Cheap helmets may also lack both fit and the ability to adjust interior straps and dials.</p><p><strong>Does my kid need MIPS?<br></strong>It depends. We’ll say this: MIPS or any other technology like Bontrager’s WaveCel is not going to be a bad idea for your child’s helmet, though there’s not much research done on youth and technologies like MIPS.
