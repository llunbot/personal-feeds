{"title":"★ Quickly Toggling Closed Captions on Apple TV (But Not in Netflix)","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2024/03/quickly_toggling_closed_captions_on_apple_tv","date":1710541830000,"content":"\n<p>I know it’s a trend for people to just leave closed captions enabled whenever they’re watching TV, even for shows and movies in which they can easily understand the dialog. I can’t do that though, because I find captions highly distracting if I don’t need them.</p>\n\n<p>But while watching the <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/15/the-gentlemen\">aforelinked</a> <em>The Gentlemen</em> on Netflix this past week, I found myself toggling captions on and back off frequently, as I couldn’t understand the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s11qjmvTdJ8\">cockney accent</a> spoken by many characters. So when a scene with cockney-speaking characters would start, I’d swipe up on the Apple TV remote, and toggle the on-screen “CC” button in the Netflix app. When the scene ended, repeat.  I tried just leaving captions on, but I really do find it unbearably distracting when I <em>do</em> understand what’s being said. This made me think there has to be a better way to toggle captions than manually swiping and clicking on the Apple TV remote touchpad.</p>\n\n<p>Turns out there are two better ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>If you use the Control Center Apple TV remote control on your iPhone, <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/use-ios-or-ipados-control-center-atvb701cadc1/tvos\">there’s a dedicated “CC” button</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>In tvOS, go to Settings → Accessibility → Accessibility Shortcut, and set it to  “Closed Captions”. Now you can just triple-click the Menu/Back button on the remote to toggle captions. (On older Apple TV remotes, the button is labelled “Menu”; <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205305\">on the new remote</a>, it’s labelled with a “&lt;”.)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>But here’s the hitch: Netflix’s tvOS app doesn’t support either of these ways to toggle captions. Netflix <em>only</em> supports the on-screen caption toggle in their custom video player. I get why Netflix and other streaming apps want to use their own custom video players, but it ought to be mandated by App Store review that they support <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/accessibility-features-atvbaeff85db/tvos\">accessibility features</a> like this one.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Postscript:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@bpmarkowitz/post/C4jkB2ktO8p\">Ben Markowitz tried the captions accessibility shortcut in a dozen popular tvOS apps</a>. Only works in Paramount+ and ESPN. Just terrible.</p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b764e966f6a9fec5fb88c53c8cb51358d484169c009f10ed78565b0ce401e5c0","category":"Tech"}
