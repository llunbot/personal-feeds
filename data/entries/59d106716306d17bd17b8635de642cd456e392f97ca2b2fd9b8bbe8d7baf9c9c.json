{"title":"Bloomberg Broke an Embargo and Put Evan Gershkovich’s Release at Risk Just to Claim a Scoop","link":"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/bloombergs-risky-embargo-breaking-evan-gershkovich-scoop.html","date":1722632541000,"content":"\n<p>Charlotte Klein, reporting for New York Magazine:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to multiple sources at the Journal and other major\noutlets, the Bloomberg scoop left journalists and government\nofficials fuming. With a prisoner swap, you don’t know if it’s\ngoing to happen until it happens. (As one Journal reporter put it:\n“We literally had Yaroslav Trofimov on the ground with binoculars\nwaiting to see Evan come off the plane, and we pubbed as soon as\nthat happened.”) Which means that Bloomberg’s story proclaiming\nGershkovich was free was inaccurate, given that the Russian plane\nwas still in the air at the time of publication. That plane could\nhave just turned around and gone back to Moscow, which is why the\nJournal and other publications had agreed to hold off.</p>\n\n<p>“Incensed” is how one reporter, whose outlet had agreed to an\nembargo — delaying publishing what they knew — reacted to\nBloomberg’s decision. “People are very, very disappointed in\nBloomberg. And not just the embargo breaking, but the football\nspiking.” (The Bloomberg editor’s X post was later deleted.)\nAnother reporter added, “We all want to break stories. We also\nneed to consider the risks of breaking those stories. I hope\neditors and reporters thought long and hard about the risks of\nrevealing the details of a hostage transfer before the hostages\nwere back in U.S. custody.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is no accountability at Bloomberg. I’ve fumed for years regarding their refusal to retract “The Big Hack”. But this is so much worse. As bad as “The Big Hack” was, journalistically, it wasn’t life-and-death. The exchange of these prisoners was.</p>\n\n<p>What a disgrace, driven by their institutional obsession with being the first to report scoops.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/02/bloomberg-evan-gershkovich-scoop\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"59d106716306d17bd17b8635de642cd456e392f97ca2b2fd9b8bbe8d7baf9c9c","category":"Tech"}
