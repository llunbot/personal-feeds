It can unexpectedly toss large airplanes up and down by several hundred feet, potentially damaging the airframe and injuring passengers and crew.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/dangerous-clear-air-turbulence-is-worsening-due-to-global-warming/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/dangerous-clear-air-turbulence-is-worsening-due-to-global-warming/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Bob Berwyn, Inside Climate News","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a8757e1f6fdd88b9428a7b5dc927755a3a53e2c192e09714655d52697ddc9d65","category":"Tech"}
