Intel and other chipmakers go to great lengths to prevent such access by unauthorized people.</p>\n<p>Once in developer mode, an attacker can extract the key used to encrypt data stored in the TPM enclave and, in the event TPM is being used to store a Bitlocker key, defeat that latter protection as well. An adversary could also bypass code-signing restrictions that prevent unauthorized firmware from running in the <a href=\"https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/getting-started-with-intel-active-management-technology-amt.html\">Intel Management Engine</a>, a subsystem inside vulnerable CPUs, and from there permanently backdoor the chip.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813247#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813247&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e5d6dc0f014d09d6e657a490391cd6230a2cd333f5659da24581b17e230c28db","category":"Tech"}
