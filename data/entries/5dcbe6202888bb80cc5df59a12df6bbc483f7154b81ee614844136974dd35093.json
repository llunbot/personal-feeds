Last year, Google was found to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/google-search-antitrust-monopoly/\">have a search monopoly</a>, and antitrust regulators have since been deciding on the actions that should be taken to address Google's anticompetitive practices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe DoJ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/google-search-antitrust-monopoly/\">first asked the court</a> to force the sale of Chrome back in November, under the Biden administration. Google <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/09/google-donates-1-million-to-trumps-inauguration-fund.html\">donated $1 million</a> to Trump's inauguration fund, and Google leadership heaped praise on Trump, perhaps in the hope that the Trump administration would scale back on its recommendations, but that does not appear to have happened.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe latest DoJ filing refers to Google's \"unlawful and unchecked, monopolistic conduct\" that has led to people being reliant on the Google search engine, calling Google an \"economic goliath.\"\r<br />\nThe DoJ says that \"Google must divest the Chrome browser\" to provide the opportunity for another company to \"operate a significant gateway to search the internet\" without Google's control.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to divesting Chrome, the DoJ is also recommending that Google be barred from entering into search engine agreements with Apple, which would put an end to the payments that Google makes to Apple to be the default search engine on iPhones, iPads, and Macs, but the DoJ does allow for Google to pay Apple for services that don't have to do with search.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe DoJ says that it would also recommend the divestiture of Android if the proposed remedies do not go far enough to keep Google from \"improperly leveraging\" Android to its advantage, or if Google attempts to circumvent the remedies put in place by the court, but it has backed off of an imminent Android sale. Google is also not being required to divest all of its AI investments. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle and the DoJ will be back in court in April where the judge overseeing the case will decide on remedies.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chrome/\">Chrome</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/doj/\">DOJ</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/doj-google-chrome-sale/\">U.S. DoJ Again Calls for Google to Sell Chrome</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/u-s-doj-again-calls-for-google-to-sell-chrome.2452752/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5dcbe6202888bb80cc5df59a12df6bbc483f7154b81ee614844136974dd35093","category":"Apple"}
