This new version of their bikepacking model is a 4130 triple-butted chromoly version of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/viral-bikes-derive-pinion-smart-shift-titanium-bikepacking-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">titanium Dérive</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-complete-bike-rigid.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-complete-bike-rigid.webp\" alt=\"Viral Bikes Dérive CR complete bike rigid\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-complete-bike-rigid.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-complete-bike-rigid-297x129.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-complete-bike-rigid-120x52.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-complete-bike-rigid-768x333.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Viral Bikes)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Viral says they’ve been hesitant about releasing a steel bike, stating they were worried that the weight would be too much. But at the same time, they recognize that the price of the titanium version is “prohibitively expensive” and the “ride quality of steel is still so sublime”. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-non-drive.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-non-drive.webp\" alt=\"Viral Bikes Dérive CR non-drive\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-non-drive.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-non-drive-297x129.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-non-drive-120x52.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-non-drive-768x333.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Viral Bikes’ Founder and Engineer, Steve Domahidy continued, “We can now offer a complete bike at nearly half the price of our titanium bike, which just makes it more approachable to a lot more people”. Boom, the Dérive CR was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dérive CR Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Dérive maintains the same geometry as the titanium version. Instead of corrosion-resistant Ti, the new frames are coated in a rust-proofing process before painting. That allows the new Dérive to carry the same lifetime warranty as all of the Viral Bike models.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-seat-stay-bridge.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-seat-stay-bridge.webp\" alt=\"Viral Bikes Dérive CR seat stay bridge\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-seat-stay-bridge.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-seat-stay-bridge-297x129.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-seat-stay-bridge-120x52.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-seat-stay-bridge-768x333.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When purchasing the new Dérive CR, you can pick to run a color-matched Viral Carbon Boost fork or a Rock Shox Pike Select with 120mm of travel. Designed for all-day comfort, the frame’s ride quality with the 29 x 2.6″ tires will give you a smooth and supple ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-gearbox.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-gearbox.webp\" alt=\"Viral Bikes Dérive CR gearbox\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-gearbox.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-gearbox-297x129.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-gearbox-120x52.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-gearbox-768x333.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also buy this new Dérive as a frameset only, in case you have an existing gearbox you’d like to continue to use. The frame can also be purchased with a mechanical or Smart.Shift gearbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-frame-kit-rigid.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-frame-kit-rigid.webp\" alt=\"Viral Bikes Dérive CR frame kit rigid\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-frame-kit-rigid.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-frame-kit-rigid-297x129.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-frame-kit-rigid-120x52.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-frame-kit-rigid-768x333.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Rigid or…</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-frame-kit-Pike-fork.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-frame-kit-Pike-fork.webp\" alt=\"Viral Bikes Dérive CR frame kit Pike fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-frame-kit-Pike-fork.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-frame-kit-Pike-fork-297x129.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-frame-kit-Pike-fork-120x52.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-frame-kit-Pike-fork-768x333.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>….Rock Shox Pike 120mm</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When purchasing the frameset, you still get the same fork choice of either a color-matched Viral Carbon Boost fork or a Rock Shox Pike Select.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-frame-deets.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-frame-deets.webp\" alt=\"Viral Bikes Dérive CR frame deets\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-frame-deets.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-frame-deets-297x129.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-frame-deets-120x52.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Viral-Bikes-Derive-CR-frame-deets-768x333.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Viral Dérive CR complete bike has a great build spec, with a PNW cockpit and dropper post, Ergon saddle, and grips.
