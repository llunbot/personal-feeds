The cable TV replacement service launched in 2017 for $35, but it went up to $40 in 2018, $50 in 2019, $65 in 2020, and with this latest price increase, it's up to $72.99 a month. It's a cable TV replacement at cable TV prices.</p>\n<p>YouTube made the announcement <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouTubeTV/status/1636405345810780163\">on Twitter</a>, saying, \"As content costs have risen and we continue to invest in our quality of service, we’ll be adjusting our monthly cost.\" You have to wonder if \"content costs\" means the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/with-apple-bowing-out-youtube-is-close-to-scoring-nfl-sunday-ticket/\">massive NFL Sunday Ticket</a> deal Google recently signed for $2 billion per year. Google will probably charge individual users $300 per year for its new NFL package, but the service is typically a <a href=\"https://tvanswerman.com/2022/05/11/directv-does-nfl-sunday-ticket-make-a-profit/\">money-losing endeavor</a> even with those giant yearly bills, so raising the YouTube TV price for non-subscribers makes some financial sense.</p>\n<p>The good news is that YouTube's announcement isn't all about higher prices. That $72.99 a month only gets you HD service, and an upgrade to 4K resolution has traditionally been available for $19.99 extra per month. The 4K add-on is now going <em>down</em> in price to $9.99 per month, so if you've been subscribed to 4K this whole time, your monthly bill will actually go down $2.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924908#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924908&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7f3769d7e70ea73d90cd7559e780eb219c74e2d0035b81f3e829914d2cdb5e01","category":"Tech"}
