Matthew has expounded on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/are-folding-bikes-good\" target=\"_blank\">the delights of folding bikes</a> while Paddy Madison discovered why the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hardknott-pass\" target=\"_blank\">Hardknott Pass</a> is the hardest climb in England.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-of-britain\" target=\"_blank\">Tour of Britain</a> is in full swing, with a dominating display so far by Olav Kooij, Wout van Aert and their <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jumbo-visma\" target=\"_blank\">Jumbo-Visma</a> teammates.

I’m still trying to fit in longer walks and hikes as the summer sun insists on staying out for just a while longer, and this backpack from Stubble &amp; Co is extremely good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed for cycling and the outdoors in general, the backpack is made lightweight and comes in either 14L or 20L sizes. There are two side pockets and water-resistant zips, although fortunately I haven’t needed to test its full capabilities against rain just yet. There are also compartments and pockets galore inside, ideal for cycling trip essentials, laptop carrying or general life bumf. It all closes with the roll top and G clip.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stubbleandco.com%2Fpages%2Fshop-all%3Fgclid%3DCjwKCAjw6eWnBhAKEiwADpnw9tuTufA8Q1HIahu_2bbCiwM9aDBroCDilNJC8S6uu6cnnd0eO1SE6RoCdRwQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">Stubble &amp; Co (£105)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><em>The Race of Truth</em> by Leigh Timmis</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"727\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/The-Race-of-Truth-book-970x727.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/The-Race-of-Truth-book-970x727.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/The-Race-of-Truth-book-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/The-Race-of-Truth-book-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/The-Race-of-Truth-book-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/The-Race-of-Truth-book-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/The-Race-of-Truth-book-750x562.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/The-Race-of-Truth-book-1140x855.jpeg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My Goodreads account is limited in its variety. I either pick up mystery/crime tales, cycling reads or psychological books with a nod towards experiencing a quarterlife crisis for those named Robyn, aged 25, living in Manchester. Anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leigh Timmis made history in 2018 by becoming the fastest person to ride across Europe. His time of 16 days, 10 hours and 45 minutes beat the previous record by 8 days and 17 hours. But, as he explains in this book, such an ultra-endurance world record challenge isn’t simply a case of being fast. He also had to mentally prepare. Timmis was diagnosed with depression – something relatable to myself – and attempted a series of sporting challenges afterwards, the titular ‘race of truth’ across Europe being one of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Race of Truth</em> an intimate read, one where Timmis not only takes us on his journey to the finish line in Portugal, but also exposes his vulnerabilities and determination for all to see. It’s truly something.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waterstones.com%2Fbook%2Fthe-race-of-truth%2Fleigh-timmis%2F9781837991402\" target=\"_blank\">Waterstones (£10.99)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>OneOdio Open Rock Earbuds</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"727\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/OneOdio-Earbuds-970x727.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/OneOdio-Earbuds-970x727.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/OneOdio-Earbuds-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/OneOdio-Earbuds-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/OneOdio-Earbuds-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/OneOdio-Earbuds-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/OneOdio-Earbuds-750x562.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/OneOdio-Earbuds-1140x855.jpeg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Open Rock S Earbuds from OneOdio are adjustable to suit the shape of your ears and can provide 46 hours of music and calls – handy for <em>Cyclist</em> Teams meetings and listening to Mac Miller on repeat throughout the day.

I’m honestly devastated at her retirement. I grew up enthralled with this entertaining Dutchwoman on her bike, taking risks I could never dream of and collecting the biggest accolades in the sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You name it, she’s probably won it. La Vuelta Femenina. The Giro Rosa/Donne. The Tour de France Femmes. Tour of Flanders. Liège Bastogne-Liège. World Championship Road Race. World Championship Time Trial. European Championship Road Race. National Championship Time Trial. National Championship Road Race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Vleuten has been present for such welcoming changes in the sport: race expansions, a growing peloton, increasing prize money… While this marks a changing-of-the-guard moment, I can’t help but feel a twinge of melancholy at the concept of a Van Vleuten-less peloton going onwards. But what a career. What an athlete. What a phenomenal person.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/stubble-co-roll-top-backpack\">In the Drops: Stubble &amp; Co’s Roll Top Backpack, ‘The Race of Truth’ by Leigh Timmis, OneOdio Open Rock S Earbuds and Annemiek van Vleuten’s retirement</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"4cf43e7d5d81b01199b4afcac49f508d66dc899e555c3fcf3508813be0e4b1d9","category":"Cycling"}
