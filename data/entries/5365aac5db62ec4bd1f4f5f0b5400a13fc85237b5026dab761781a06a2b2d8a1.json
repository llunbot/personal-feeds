But now, that will no longer be possible due to the limited ability of <em>Odysseus</em> to gather solar energy and remain powered on. As the Sun dips closer to the horizon, and with the two-week-long lunar night coming, the spacecraft will, effectively, freeze to death.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005870#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005870&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5365aac5db62ec4bd1f4f5f0b5400a13fc85237b5026dab761781a06a2b2d8a1","category":"Tech"}
