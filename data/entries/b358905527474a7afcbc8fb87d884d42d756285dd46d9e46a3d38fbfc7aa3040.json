When the device was announced in September 2023, it continued to only be available in the same natural titanium color as the first-generation model. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nNow, further indication has emerged that Apple had plans to release a darker color option. The latest images, <a href=\"https://x.com/DongleBookPro/status/1744716821553676298?s=20\">shared by \"DongleBookPro\" on X</a>, show a blue Alpine Loop prototype with an anodized black titanium hook and lugs. The released version of the Alpine Loop has natural titanium trim to match the Apple Watch Ultra's casing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Space Black Apple Watch Ultra Confirmed? <a href=\"https://t.co/aLjkJGCsg7\">pic.twitter.com/aLjkJGCsg7</a></p>— Dongle (@DongleBookPro) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DongleBookPro/status/1744716821553676298?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 9, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nApple released the blue version of the Alpine Loop alongside the ‌Apple Watch Ultra 2‌, supporting previous indications that the company had concrete plans to release the ‌Apple Watch Ultra 2‌ with a black color option. In November, documents filed with the United States Federal Communications Commission <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/new-apple-watch-ultra-black-prototype-images/\">revealed a black Apple Watch Ultra</a> with a matching dark ceramic back, cementing the validity of earlier rumors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-watch-ultra-prototype-fcc.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe reason for Apple's decision to cancel the new colorway is unknown, but there is a chance that the company deemed the finish insufficiently durable for a device focused on withstanding extreme challenges. There have not yet been any rumors to suggest that Apple plans to revive the black colorway for the third-generation version of the device, but it could still be a possibility given how far developed the darker finish was for the current model prior to its release.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/donglebookpro/\">DongleBookPro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/prototypes/\">Prototypes</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/band-designed-for-black-apple-watch-ultra-surfaces/\">Band Designed for Black Apple Watch Ultra Surfaces Online</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/band-designed-for-black-apple-watch-ultra-surfaces-online.2415859/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b358905527474a7afcbc8fb87d884d42d756285dd46d9e46a3d38fbfc7aa3040","category":"Apple"}
