Fink, reporting for Car and Driver:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This next-generation CarPlay builds upon previous versions by \nintegrating into all of the displays of a given vehicle and not \njust the central infotainment screen. Though the familiar CarPlay \nexperience remains, multiple template options and special details \nensure the interface reflects the ethos of a given brand. </p>\n\n<p>For instance, the preview of Porsche’s CarPlay interface shows \nthat it features a trio of circular gauges in the cluster and a \nbackground wallpaper that mimics the brand’s distinct houndstooth \n(or Pepita in Porsche-speak) seat pattern. </p>\n\n<p>Aston Martin, on the other hand, goes a slightly different route. \nIts cluster includes a central information screen bookended by a \ncircular speedometer and tachometer, the latter of which \nintegrates “Handbuilt in Great Britain” wraparound text. [...] </p>\n\n<p>This connection to the vehicle also means this new generation of \nCarPlay can cohesively display information from the vehicle’s \nnative infotainment system (think tire-pressure information and \nthe like), as well. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not a false alarm <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/28/porsche-carplay\">like back in August</a> — these really are the first announcements of support for the next-generation CarPlay that <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/06/apple-unveils-new-ways-to-share-and-communicate-in-ios-16/\">Apple announced at WWDC 2022</a>, just under the gun for the promised “before the end of 2023”.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/20/aston-martin-porsche-carplay\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b0f61620aaa19d1058d4017ab16ef6213622705d1933772abd678ad634e6fc49","category":"Tech"}
