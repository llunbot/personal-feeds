Today, <a href=\"https://www.onwardbrands.com/\">Onward Brands</a> announced that it's giving those discarded Microsoft-stamped gadgets a second life under new branding. Products like the Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard will become Incase products with \"Designed by Microsoft\" branding.</p>\n<p>Beyond the computer accessories saying \"Designed by Microsoft,\" they should be the same keyboards, mice, webcams, headsets, and speakers, Onward, Incase's parent company, said, per <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/5/24026323/microsoft-incase-partnership-keyboards-accessories-partnership\">The Verge</a>. Onward said its Incase brand will bring back 23 Microsoft-designed products in 2024 and hopes for availability to start in Q2.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/incase.jpg\"><img alt=\"Some of the Microsoft-designed gear that Incase is relaunching. \" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/incase-640x427.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/incase.jpg 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/incase.jpg\">Some of the Microsoft-designed gear that Incase is relaunching. </a> (credit: <a href=\"https://www.incase.com/pages/incase-designed-by-microsoft\">Incase </a>)</p></div>\n<p>Incase also plans to launch an ergonomic keyboard that Microsoft designed but never released.
