Claimed battery life increases to 37 days in smartwatch mode, provided the solar-charging screen is exposed to three hours of direct sunlight a day.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"fēnix 7S Pro – Sapphire Solar Edition, Soft Gold with Limestone Leather Band\" title=\"fenix7SPro_HR_4002.4.jpg\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Hill Score is only a measuring of your running ability uphill.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Garmin</i></span></div>\n<p>Both <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-watch/\">smartwatches</a> come with new training metrics, including an Endurance Score, weather map overlays and a built-in LED flashlight, which Garmin says can light your way at night.</p>\n<p>They also can receive smart notifications, download and play songs from music streaming services and checkout contactlessly at shops with Garmin Pay.</p>\n<p>Like Garmin’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-computers/\">best bike computers</a>, all models of the Fenix 7 Pro and Epix Pro use SatIQ technology to navigate with multi-band GPS while economising battery life.

Garmin claims this is easy to read in all light conditions.</p>\n<p>In addition, all three Epix Pro models are now equipped with a flashlight at the front. The feature was previously reserved for the most expensive version.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/wrist-based-heart-rate-monitors-vs-chest-heart-rate-straps/\">Wrist-based heart rate monitors are generally less accurate than chest strap heart monitors</a>, but Garmin says the watch’s heart rate sensor is now better at tracking your performance across multiple sports.</p>\n<p>In darker ambient light conditions, Garmin says the Epix Pro’s new Red Shift Mode changes display colours to red to help the user’s sleep.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"epix Pro (Gen 2) – Standard Edition 51mm, Carbon Gray DLC Titanium with Black Band\" title=\"EpixPro51_HR_2000.80.jpg\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Epix Pro is designed to be worn round the clock.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Garmin</i></span></div>\n<p>The Epix Pro’s new pre-loaded activity modes include football, basketball, racquet sports and horse riding.</p>\n<p>Garmin claims the new weather map overlays can warn of changing weather conditions.  Relief shading on the topographic maps makes them easier to read at a glance, according to the brand.</p>\n<p>The new Hill Score feature that measures your ability to run uphill is less likely to interest cyclists than the Endurance Score.</p>\n<p>This metric takes into account more than just your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/vo2-max\">VO2 Max</a> and analyses your activities regardless of sport to estimate your fatigue resistance and ability to sustain long efforts, according to Garmin.</p>\n<p>In GPS mode, the Garmin Epix Pro’s claimed battery life is 58 hours.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Garmin Fenix 7 Pro</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"fēnix 7 Pro – Sapphire Solar Edition, Titanium with Fog Gray/Ember Orange Band\" title=\"fenix7Pro_HR_3000.6.jpg\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> All Fenix 7 Pro models come with multiband GNSS/GPS navigation.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Garmin </i></span></div>\n<p>All three sizes of the Fenix 7 Pro now include the LED flashlight, multiband GNSS/GPS and solar charging.
