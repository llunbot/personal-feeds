And they have wind tunnel test data to back up that claims. Nano Worx’s secret is that each mount is designed for a specific GPS computer, so it neatly clicks into place behind the aerodynamic nose of the Aero Mount smoothing airflow over and around your device.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Nano Worx 3D-printed GPS-specific Aero computer mounts</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nano-Worx-Aero-Mount_Wahoo-Elemnt-Roam-mount-detail-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nano-Worx-Aero-Mount_Wahoo-Elemnt-Roam-mount-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Nano Worx Aero Mount, individually 3D-printed GPS-specific aerodynamic cycling computer mounts, Wahoo Elemnt Roam mount detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nano-Worx-Aero-Mount_Wahoo-Elemnt-Roam-mount-detail-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nano-Worx-Aero-Mount_Wahoo-Elemnt-Roam-mount-detail-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nano-Worx-Aero-Mount_Wahoo-Elemnt-Roam-mount-detail-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nano-Worx-Aero-Mount_Wahoo-Elemnt-Roam-mount-detail-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nano-Worx-Aero-Mount_Wahoo-Elemnt-Roam-mount-detail-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos/Nano Worx)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Each Nano Worx Aero Mounts is specifically designed to smooth airflow over your specific GPS cycling computer model, with an aerodynamic cowl optimzed for the exact shape of your GPS. And what’s then so unique with these 3D-printed computer mounts is the attachment design. First, you rotate your device into the mount to secure it. Then you slide the GPS forward in the mount to tuck it up closely to the aerodynamic cowl, where a small rare earth magnet holds it in place for maximized aerodynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nano-Worx-Aero-Mount_individually-3D-printed-GPS-specific-aerodynamic-cycling-computer-mounts_Wind-tunnel-results-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1250\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nano-Worx-Aero-Mount_individually-3D-printed-GPS-specific-aerodynamic-cycling-computer-mounts_Wind-tunnel-results-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Nano Worx Aero Mount, individually 3D-printed GPS-specific aerodynamic cycling computer mounts, wind tunnel results\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nano-Worx-Aero-Mount_individually-3D-printed-GPS-specific-aerodynamic-cycling-computer-mounts_Wind-tunnel-results-jpg.webp 1250w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nano-Worx-Aero-Mount_individually-3D-printed-GPS-specific-aerodynamic-cycling-computer-mounts_Wind-tunnel-results-297x143.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nano-Worx-Aero-Mount_individually-3D-printed-GPS-specific-aerodynamic-cycling-computer-mounts_Wind-tunnel-results-120x58.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nano-Worx-Aero-Mount_individually-3D-printed-GPS-specific-aerodynamic-cycling-computer-mounts_Wind-tunnel-results-768x369.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nano Worx took their Garmin Aero Mount into the wind tunnel to see how it stood up next to a baseline strap mount on top of the handlebar, no mount at all, and the stock Garmin out-front mount. And the results show a ~1W reduction in wind averaged power at 45km/hr vs. the stock out-front mount, even some reduction vs. no cycling computer at all, and almost 3W savings compared to the baseline mount. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nano-Worx-Aero-Mount_individually-3D-printed-GPS-specific-aerodynamic-cycling-computer-mounts_Canyon-Garmin-cockpit-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nano-Worx-Aero-Mount_individually-3D-printed-GPS-specific-aerodynamic-cycling-computer-mounts_Canyon-Garmin-cockpit-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Nano Worx Aero Mount, individually 3D-printed GPS-specific aerodynamic cycling computer mounts, Canyon with Garmin\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nano-Worx-Aero-Mount_individually-3D-printed-GPS-specific-aerodynamic-cycling-computer-mounts_Canyon-Garmin-cockpit-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nano-Worx-Aero-Mount_individually-3D-printed-GPS-specific-aerodynamic-cycling-computer-mounts_Canyon-Garmin-cockpit-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nano-Worx-Aero-Mount_individually-3D-printed-GPS-specific-aerodynamic-cycling-computer-mounts_Canyon-Garmin-cockpit-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nano-Worx-Aero-Mount_individually-3D-printed-GPS-specific-aerodynamic-cycling-computer-mounts_Canyon-Garmin-cockpit-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nano-Worx-Aero-Mount_individually-3D-printed-GPS-specific-aerodynamic-cycling-computer-mounts_Canyon-Garmin-cockpit-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nano-Worx-Aero-Mount_individually-3D-printed-GPS-specific-aerodynamic-cycling-computer-mounts_Canyon-Garmin-cockpit-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div><blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-l9EGhJGFu/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-l9EGhJGFu/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Nano Worx (@nano.worx_)</a></p></div></blockquote></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>3D-printed carbon-reinforced plastic construction</li>\n\n\n\n<li>rotate to lock your device into place, then slide forward for aero gains held in place by magnets</li>\n\n\n\n<li>direct-mount out-front style mounting only, including stainless mounting bolts</li>\n\n\n\n<li>compatible only with 1-piece handlebar+stem cockpits from: Canyon, Cervelo, Pinarello, Scott, Specialized &amp;
