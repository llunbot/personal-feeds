Unlike some camping mats, there is no foam-supporting structure inside the helmet.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Inflabi inflatable helmet (14 of 10)\" title=\"Inflabi inflatable helmet (14 of 10)\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A standard pump is all that’s required to inflate the helmet.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The helmet is inflated using a standard pump via a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/presta-vs-schrader-valves/\">Schrader valve</a>.</p>\n<p>The current helmet is inflated to 1 bar (14.5psi), but the production version will need to withstand up to 2 bar to meet safety requirements. This may require the brand to use a different fabric, though the overall design of the helmet will remain the same.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Inflabi inflatable helmet – packed shots\" title=\"Inflabi inflatable helmet – packed shots\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The helmet packs down to approximately three quarters of its inflated size.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Inflabi was keen to stress the valve system will be redesigned prior to going into production. It will likely be slimmed down and include a pressure gauge or indicator to confirm correct inflation.</p>\n<p>The tech behind the helmet has been patented by the brand and a new prototype is in testing. The brand expects this will comfortably surpass European helmet safety standards.</p>\n<h2>Availability, sizing and pricing</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Inflabi inflatable helmet – profile shot\" title=\"Inflabi inflatable helmet – profile shot\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Inflabi is expected to cost around €150.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Inflabi hopes to run a pre-sale of an initial 300 helmets in August.
