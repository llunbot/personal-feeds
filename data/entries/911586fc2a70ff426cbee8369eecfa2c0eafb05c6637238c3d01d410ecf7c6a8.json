{"title":"Yankees Legend Rickey Henderson Dies at 65","link":"https://www.cupofcoffeenews.com/cup-of-coffee-extra-rickey-henderson-1958-2024-2/","date":1734818529000,"content":"\n<p>Craig Calcaterra, writing at Cup of Coffee:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To say this is a massive loss is about as big an understatement as\nis possible. Henderson was the biggest and brightest star of his\ngeneration. There may not have been any player in history who was\nbetter at more things than Rickey Henderson was.</p>\n\n<p>Henderson was, without question, the greatest leadoff hitter of\nall time and the greatest base-stealer of all time. He, arguably,\npossessed the greatest combination of power and speed of any\nplayer in the history of the game as well. Perhaps the best\ncharacterization of Henderson’s career came from Bill James who\nonce wrote that, “if you could split Rickey Henderson in two,\nyou’d have two Hall of Famers.” [...]</p>\n\n<p>In 1980, his first full major league season, Henderson broke Ty\nCobb’s 65-year-old American League record for stolen bases by\nswiping 100 bags to Cobb’s 96. In 1982 he stole 130 bases,\nbreaking Hall of Famer Lou Brock’s all-time single-season record\nof 118. Henderson’s 130 steals that year stands as the record to\nthis day. He would lead the American League in stolen bases in\neach of his first seven full seasons and nine of his first ten.\nHe’d lead his league in steals in 12 seasons in all, the last of\nwhich came in 1998 when he was 39 years-old.</p>\n\n<p>On May 1, 1991, Henderson broke Brock’s all-time stolen base\nrecord with his 939th steal and would go on to steal an astounding\n1,406 bases before he retired. No player has come anywhere close\nto Henderson’s mark in the three decades since he set it and many\ndoubt anyone ever will.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You have to be really good even to have had been on base that many times, to have had the opportunity to steal 1,400+ bases, let alone to have actually swiped them. He was amazing. He’s best known for his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_career_stolen_bases_leaders\">career base-stealing record</a>, but Henderson — thanks to his speed, talent, competitiveness, and remarkable longevity — is also the career leader in runs scored. Scoring runs is how you win — you can make the case that no stat is more important in baseball, and Rickey (as everyone called him, <a href=\"https://www.fanhospitality.com/blog/2017/04/10/top-10-times-rickey-henderson-referred-to-himself-in-the-third-person/\">including himself</a>) scored more runs than anyone who ever played. Look at the names on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_career_runs_scored_leaders\">the top 10 for career runs scored</a>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Rickey Henderson 2,295</li>\n<li>Ty Cobb 2,245</li>\n<li>Barry Bonds 2,227</li>\n<li>Hank Aaron 2,174</li>\n<li>Babe Ruth 2,174</li>\n<li>Pete Rose 2,165</li>\n<li>Willie Mays 2,068</li>\n<li>Alex Rodriguez 2,021</li>\n<li>Stan Musial 1,949</li>\n<li>Derek Jeter 1,923</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What a player, and <a href=\"https://not.fangraphs.com/another-reason-why-rickey-is-the-greatest/\">character</a>, he was. Rickey was the most exciting player I ever saw.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/21/rickey-rip\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"911586fc2a70ff426cbee8369eecfa2c0eafb05c6637238c3d01d410ecf7c6a8","category":"Tech"}
