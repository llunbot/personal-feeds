It also might seem like SpaceX is regularly breaking one of its records, whether it's in the number of launches, turnaround time, or reusing Falcon 9 boosters. It's also true.</p>\n<p>SpaceX blew past one of those records over Labor Day weekend when the company launched a Falcon 9 rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This mission was SpaceX's 62nd launch of the year using its Falcon 9 or Falcon Heavy rocket, or 63rd if you count the test flight of the Starship mega-rocket in April.</p>\n<p>SpaceX has launched 83 Falcon 9 or Falcon Heavy missions over the past 12 months.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965920#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965920&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7c6f6463e7d1d6b5576bc5a3e6d2ab367c95f4c999ea9d9d859ee44d577c4628","category":"Tech"}
