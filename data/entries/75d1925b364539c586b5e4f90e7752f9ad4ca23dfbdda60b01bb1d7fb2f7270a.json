Well, in case you forgot, the New York Times is here to remind you that the Siri drama hasn’t gone away. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tripp Mickle <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/technology/apple-issues-trump-tariffs.html\">reports</a> on Apple’s “inability to make good on new ideas,” providing insight from unnamed sources about the company’s mishandling of AI development. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2624966/apples-next-gen-siri-might-be-delayed-until-2027.html\">previously reported</a> that Apple will delay the new AI-based Siri features until 2026, but near the end of MIckle’s article is a glimmer of hope–or some hopeful thinking by some Apple insiders:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apple hasn’t canceled its revamped Siri. The company plans to release a virtual assistant in the fall capable of doing things like editing and sending a photo to a friend on request, three people with knowledge of its plans said.</p>\n<cite><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/technology/apple-issues-trump-tariffs.html\">Tripp Mickle, New York Times</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>That sounds like it will arrive in the first version of iOS 19, rather than iOS 19.3 or later in 2026, as some had speculated. Mickle goes on to report that Apple leaders think there is “time to get [AI] right” because Google, Meta, and others haven’t figured it out yet. That might be true, but it sure seems like Apple’s competition has its AI plans in much better shape than Apple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple truly believes it can deliver this fall, then that will make <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC25</a> in June much more interesting and give us <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2646255/apples-big-wwdc-keynote-is-coming-i-dont-care.html\">something to care about</a>. Apple will almost certainly <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2649634/will-apple-repeat-its-mistakes-at-wwdc-2025-or-alter-course.html\">address</a> the Siri situation then–it has to, it’s the elephant in the room–and the company will either proclaim a Siri delivery in the fall or a much later date. We’ll have to wait and see.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"75d1925b364539c586b5e4f90e7752f9ad4ca23dfbdda60b01bb1d7fb2f7270a","category":"Apple"}
