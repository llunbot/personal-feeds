You can also get the <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1668246-REG/apple_mbp_14_sg_46_14_2_macbook_pro_with.html?BI=21883&amp;KBID=28249&amp;SID=1-1-1960563-1-0-0\">14-inch MacBook Pro with the same specs and 2TB of storage for $2,499</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though it’s nearly two years old, this laptop is still one of the best Macs you can buy. It has an M1 Max processor with a 10-core CPU and 32-core GPU, as well as maxed-out 64GB of RAM, and 4TB of storage. It also has the same remarkable ProMotion display as the new version, an excellent keyboard, and plenty of connectivity, including three Thunderbolt ports, HDMI, and an SD card reader. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what’s different between this model and the M2 Max one? Other than a faster chip, the new model has upgraded wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi 6E versus Wi-Fi 6), Bluetooth (5.3 versus 5), and a newer HDMI port (2 versus 2.1) with the ability to run higher-resolution monitors. But unless you have a brand-new router or an 8K monitor, the savings here are far worth the sacrifices.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6278ce39d3425237c6518e8eabb6285e6f99135b1b249a65071c4abfb9d652aa","category":"Apple"}
