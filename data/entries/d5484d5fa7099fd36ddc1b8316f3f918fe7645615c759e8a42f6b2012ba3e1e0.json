Juli Clover for MacRumors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Game emulator apps have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/apple-removes-igba-from-app-store/\">come and gone</a> since <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/app-store-guidelines-emulators-music-app-links/\">Apple \nannounced App Store support</a> for them on April 5, but now \npopular game emulator Delta from developer Riley Testut is \navailable for download. [...] </p>\n\n<p>Delta is an all-in-one emulator that supports game systems \nincluding NES, SNES, N64, Nintendo DS, Game Boy, and Game Boy \nAdvance. It works with popular game controllers, and supports \ncheats, save states, backups, syncing, and more. As this is \nTestut’s longtime project, it is more polished and feature rich \nthan other emulators that have popped up. [...] </p>\n\n<p>Delta can be downloaded from the App Store for free, and it does \nnot collect information or include ads. The app is available in \nthe United States and other countries, but it is not available in \nthe European Union where it is instead being offered through an \nalternative app marketplace. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>An incredibly polished, high-performance game emulator, available free of charge with no ads.

There’s a big difference between emulating the Switch — which is still current — and emulating classic consoles, but Nintendo <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-entertainment-system-nintendo-switch-online-switch/\">still monetizes those classic consoles via emulation on the Switch</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/17/delta-app-store\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d5484d5fa7099fd36ddc1b8316f3f918fe7645615c759e8a42f6b2012ba3e1e0","category":"Tech"}
