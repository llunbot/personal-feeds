It was the 45th and last flight of a Delta IV launcher and the final rocket named Delta to ever launch, ending a string of 389 missions dating back to 1960.</p>\n<p>United Launch Alliance (ULA) tried to launch this rocket on March 28 but aborted the countdown about four minutes prior to liftoff due to trouble with nitrogen pumps at an off-site facility at Cape Canaveral. The nitrogen is necessary for purging parts inside the Delta IV rocket before launch, reducing the risk of a fire or explosion during the countdown.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015864#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015864&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3fec87b832bfdd15b8dec9e91cb6273ffc99e9af1b9ac3ed647cf9aa71363a79","category":"Tech"}
