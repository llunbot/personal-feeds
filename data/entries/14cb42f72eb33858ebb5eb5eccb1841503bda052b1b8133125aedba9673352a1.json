The slightly upgraded version of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/11/impressions-our-first-day-with-the-playstation-4-is-full-of-surprises/\">2013's PlayStation 4</a> came at a time when a wave of 4K TVs was <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161109006184/en/2016-a-Banner-Year-for-4K-UHD-TV-Display-Sales-to-Grow-40-Percent-as-4K-Ecosystem-Continues-to-Expand-Says-CTA\">just beginning to crest</a> in the form of tens of millions of annual sales in the US.</p>\n<p>Purchasing Sony's first-ever \"mid-generation\" console upgrade in 2016 didn't give original PS4 owners access to any new games, a fact that contributed to us <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/playstation-4-ps4-pro-review-4k/\">calling the PS4 Pro \"a questionable value proposition\"</a> when it launched.

The PS5, after all, has proven more than capable of creating excellent-looking games that take full advantage of the 4K TVs that are now practically standard in American homes. With 8K TVs <a href=\"https://variety.com/vip/8k-tv-high-resolution-tech-1236115228/\">still an extremely small market niche</a>, there isn't anything akin to what Sony's Mike Somerset called \"the most significant picture-quality increase probably since black and white went to color\" <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/ps4-pro-hdr-preview-gt-sport-nioh/\">when talking about 4K TV in 2016</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/the-ps5-pros-biggest-problem-is-that-the-ps5-is-already-very-good/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/the-ps5-pros-biggest-problem-is-that-the-ps5-is-already-very-good/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"14cb42f72eb33858ebb5eb5eccb1841503bda052b1b8133125aedba9673352a1","category":"Tech"}
