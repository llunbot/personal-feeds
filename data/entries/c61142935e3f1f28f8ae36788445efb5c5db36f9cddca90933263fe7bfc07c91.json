That's according to the leaker known as \"Ice Universe,\" who has divulged accurate information about Apple's plans in the past.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iPhone-15-Pro-Mock-Feature-Buttonless.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nBoth iPhone 15 Pro models are expected to have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/21/iphone-15-pro-ultra-thin-curved-bezels/\">thinner, curved bezels</a> compared to the iPhone 14 Pro, potentially resulting in an Apple Watch-like appearance, but if the leaker is correct, the larger 6.7-inch model will have the most minimal of bezels.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1636641249057972226?s=20\">tweet</a>, Ice Universe said the iPhone 15 Pro Max will \"break the record\" of 1.81mm bezels held by the Xiaomi 13, with Apple's upcoming model coming with a black bezel width of just 1.55mm. For comparison, Ice Universe gives measurements for bezels on the iPhone 14 Pro (2.17mm) and the Samsung Galaxy Ultra S23 (1.95mm).\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/xiaomi-13-bezels.jpg\" alt width=\"3024\" height=\"1964\" /><div><em>Screen-to-body ratio shown on display (Image: Xiaomi)</em></div>\r<br />\nIce Universe could be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1598548736875044865?s=20\">referring to the chin on the Xiaomi 13</a> or the leaker meant to say 1.61mm, as per the above image. We've contacted them for confirmation and will update if we hear back. Either way, the bezels on the iPhone 15 Pro Max are still said to be thinner.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to rumors, the bezels on all four iPhone 15 models are expected to be slightly curved around the edges, similar to the iPhone 11 series, but the width of the bezels on the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are not expected to diverge from those on iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The iPhone 15 lineup is also expected to feature the same display sizes as last year's lineup.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/05/iphone-15-pro-front-glass-leak/\">even thinner bezels around the display</a>, the iPhone 15 Pro models could have a similar appearance as the Apple Watch Series 7 and Series 8. Rumors suggest the Pro models will also feature a titanium frame instead of stainless steel, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-15-pro-solid-state-volume-rocker/\">solid-state volume, mute, and power buttons</a> that do not physically move when pressed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>iPhone 15 Pro Max will break the record of 1.81mm bezel black edge held by Xiaomi 13, and we measure that its cover plate black bezel width is only 1.55 mm.（S22 and S23 ≈1.95mm，iPhone 14 Pro 2.17mm） <a href=\"https://t.co/9TBrVCGSCo\">pic.twitter.com/9TBrVCGSCo</a></p>— Ice universe (@UniverseIce) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1636641249057972226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 17, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nIce Universe has previously shared CAD renders and dimensions that also suggest the iPhone 15 Pro Max will be unique in featuring a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/25/iphone-15-pro-max-smaller-camera-and-footprint/\">thinner camera bump and smaller footprint</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce its next iPhone lineup in September as usual.
