This will be the third flight of the kerosene-fueled Long March 8, one of a new generation of Chinese rockets designed to replace older Long March launcher designs burning toxic propellant.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011332#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011332&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6ac6c3e8b416d8340265e2ca0a9d586de0d97d7d8980e63f422d3b7db9620726","category":"Tech"}
