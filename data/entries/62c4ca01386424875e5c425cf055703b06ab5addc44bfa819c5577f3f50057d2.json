With this mounting pattern, there are four bolt combinations that pair with standard 64mm bottle boss spacing. Some of the bolt holes are dashes that allow for flexibility of bottle bosses that may not have the exact 64mm spacing, while the other bolt holes are dots that secure the bolt in the cage, eliminating movement.</p>\n<p>The new Morse Cargo Cage will fit on a fork three-pack mount or anywhere on the frame that has bottle bosses. The Morse Cargo Cage also has bolt mounting points on the angled sides for additional versatility. This is great for forks that have bottle bosses on the front or back, which allows for two cages to be mounted on the same fork arm. It is made here in Minnesota, USA from durable, corrosion-resistant 5052 aluminum.</p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pricing: Morse Cargo Cage: $39.95 USD</li>\n<li>Morse Cargo Cage + two Cargo Straps: $51.95 USD</li>\n<li>Vertical positioning adjustment up to 35mm with Morse dot-dash mount pattern</li>\n<li>Mount options in center of cage, as well as on right and left sides</li>\n<li>Designed to fit fork bags, 32 oz.
