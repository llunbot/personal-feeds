With this service, you can build hybrid networks by linking your AWS and on-premises networks to build applications that span environments without compromising performance. Last week we announced the opening of a new AWS Direct Connect location in Santiago, Chile. This new Santiago location offers dedicated 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps connections, with MACsec encryption available for 10 Gbps.
