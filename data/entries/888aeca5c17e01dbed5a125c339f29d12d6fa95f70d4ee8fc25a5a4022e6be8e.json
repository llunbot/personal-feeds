On Wednesday, the FAA said it has closed its investigation into the July 11 launch of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo vehicle. \"The investigation found the Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo vehicle deviated from its assigned airspace on its descent from space,\" the FAA stated. \"The FAA also found Virgin Galactic failed to communicate the deviation to the FAA as required. Virgin Galactic was not allowed to conduct flight operations as the investigation was ongoing. The FAA required Virgin Galactic to implement changes on how it communicates to the FAA during flight operations to keep the public safe. Virgin Galactic has made the required changes and can return to flight operations.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799850#p3\">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799850&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"888aeca5c17e01dbed5a125c339f29d12d6fa95f70d4ee8fc25a5a4022e6be8e","category":"Tech"}
