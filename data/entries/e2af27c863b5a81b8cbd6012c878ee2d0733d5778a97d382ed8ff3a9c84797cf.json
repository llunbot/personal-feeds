{"title":"The Information: ‘Apple Plans a Thinner iPhone in 2025’","link":"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-a-thinner-iphone-in-2025?rc=jfy0lk","date":1716235078000,"content":"\n<p>Wayne Ma and Qianer Liu, reporting for The Information (paywalled — <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/slim-iphone-17-top-center-cameras-rumor/\">MacRumors has a summary</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple is developing a significantly thinner version of the iPhone\nthat could be released as early as 2025, according to three people\nwith direct knowledge of the project. The slimmer iPhone could be\nreleased concurrently with the iPhone 17, expected in September\n2025, according to the three people with direct knowledge and two\nothers familiar with the project. It could be priced higher than\nthe iPhone Pro Max, currently Apple’s most expensive model\nstarting at $1,200, they said.</p>\n\n<p>The people familiar with the project described the new iPhone,\ninternally code-named D23, as a major redesign — similar to\nthe iPhone X, which Apple marketed as a technological leap from\nprevious generations and which started at $1,000 when it was\nreleased in 2017. Several of its novel features, such as\nFaceID, the OLED screen and glass back, became standard in\nsubsequent models.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The iPhone X was a true ground-up redesign of the iPhone. No more Home button (replaced by a gestural interface), Face ID, all-screen design with round corners, and more. It effectively created a fork in the platform.</p>\n\n<p>Left unsaid by The Information is how Apple plans to market this new iPhone. I suspect they’re either describing what Apple plans to call the iPhone 17 Pro, or that it’ll have a new name but replace the iPhone Pro in the lineup. That is to say, I do not think Apple plans to make regular iPhone 17’s, 17 Pros, <em>and</em> this new redesigned and more expensive thinner iPhone.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The screen will measure somewhere between the 6.12-inch diagonal\ndisplay of the standard iPhone and the 6.69-inch display of the\niPhone Pro Max, the person added. The rear cameras could be\nrelocated from the upper-left corner of the phone’s back to the\ntop center as part of the redesign, another person with direct\nknowledge said. [...] Ross Young, CEO at Display Supply Chain\nConsultants, later said on X that this model would have a\n6.55-inch display, which would make it slightly smaller than the\niPhone Pro Max.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Information isn’t coming out and saying there will only be one size, but it sure sounds like that’s the rumor — and that one size is the current Max size. It’s also worth remembering that there was <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/111864\">only one size of the iPhone X</a> (5.8 inches) but its 2018 follow-up, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/09/iphone-xs-and-iphone-xs-max-bring-the-best-and-biggest-displays-to-iphone/\">the iPhone XS</a>, added the Max size (6.5 inches). Perhaps Apple plans to ship a 5.8-inch-ish smaller iPhone 18 Pro? Or, perhaps, 6.5 inches is the new regular size and an even larger-display iPhone Pro will come in the iPhone 18 generation?</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of larger-sized iPhones, though, The Information says the Plus models are going away:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In recent years, Apple has released four iPhone models. It plans\nto drop the iPhone Plus, one of its less-expensive models, which\nhas a large screen but lacks the latest-generation processors and\ncameras, in 2025, three people said. The Plus, which debuted with\nthe iPhone 14 and will still be part of the iPhone 16 lineup this\nyear, has sold below expectations, they said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/20/the-information-iphone-17-thinner\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e2af27c863b5a81b8cbd6012c878ee2d0733d5778a97d382ed8ff3a9c84797cf","category":"Tech"}
