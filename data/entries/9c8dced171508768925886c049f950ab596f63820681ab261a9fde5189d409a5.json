{"title":"‘Silo’ Renewed for Two Additional Seasons","link":"https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/silo-renewed-season-3-ending-season-4-1236249072/","date":1734578873000,"content":"\n<p>Joe Otterson, reporting for Variety:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Silo” has been renewed for both Seasons 3 and 4 at Apple TV+,\nwith the fourth season set to be the show’s last.</p>\n\n<p>The renewal news comes as the post-apocalyptic drama is currently\nairing its second season. The sixth episode of Season 2 is due out\non Dec. 20. The season finale is scheduled to debut on Jan. 17.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I feel bad complaining about a good show not only getting renewed, but renewed through to a planned conclusion. I fucking hate <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/amazon-peripheral-season-2\">when good shows get cancelled after one season</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But. While I really liked season 1 of <em>Silo</em>, season 2 has been a bore. We’re halfway through — five episodes — and everything interesting could have been put in one episode. Maybe one and half. I hope the remaining five episodes of season 2 pick up, but so far, it really feels like this entire season has just padding to get to what’s next. Hugely disappointing, really.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/18/silo-renewed\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9c8dced171508768925886c049f950ab596f63820681ab261a9fde5189d409a5","category":"Tech"}
