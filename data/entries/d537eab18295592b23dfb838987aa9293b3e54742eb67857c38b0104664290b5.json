Apple said it would not approve future updates to WeChat or Douyin until the companies complied. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also has asked Tencent to disable in-game chats between developers and users, because they can also be used to send links, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>. Tencent has reportedly pushed back against the idea due to the negative impact it would have on the game experience.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe report characterized the moves by Apple as \"unusually aggressive\" in China, suggesting they may inflame tensions at a time when its business practices are under scrutiny by antitrust regulators around the world. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAn Apple spokesperson who contacted <em>Bloomberg</em> cited its guidelines that the sale of all digital goods must go through its system, and that its review team may reject app submissions that violate that policy.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/apple-pressures-bytedance-tencent-app-fees/\">Apple Pressures ByteDance and Tencent Over App Fee Loopholes in China</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pressures-bytedance-and-tencent-over-app-fee-loopholes-in-china.2432751/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d537eab18295592b23dfb838987aa9293b3e54742eb67857c38b0104664290b5","category":"Apple"}
