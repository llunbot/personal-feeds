The notch is indeed a good bit smaller, and the tiny increase in height is barely noticeable.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new notch design is in line with rumors that we heard during the beta testing period, which pointed to a design that was more compact and just a tiny bit taller.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNext year, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iPhone-14/\">may do away with the notch</a> entirely. Rumors suggest that at least some models will have no notch with a design that instead incorporates a hole-punch cutout for the front-facing camera, with Apple to adopt under-display Face ID.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/iphone-13-models-notch-taller/\">iPhone 13 Models Feature 20% Smaller Notch That's Just a Tiny Bit Taller</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-13-models-feature-20-smaller-notch-thats-just-a-tiny-bit-taller.2310812/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=NUhJyJS4HEA:SCePqI3R9HM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=NUhJyJS4HEA:SCePqI3R9HM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/NUhJyJS4HEA\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"de96cfb853fbc6e160472496886014e915f0f37786239209f900b7a51b9d5f43","category":"Apple"}
