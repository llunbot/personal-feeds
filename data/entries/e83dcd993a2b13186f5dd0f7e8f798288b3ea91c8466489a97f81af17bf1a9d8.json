A solid centerline delivers pure speed, while tightly packed small knobs bite into the dirt as you lean through turns.</p>\n<p>Gravel racers Whitney and Zack Allison put the Vulpine S to the test during the 8-day Transcordilleras bikepacking gravel race in Colombia, as well as the grueling 200-mile Unbound Gravel in Kansas, among other events. “The Vulpine S tires are the best of all worlds: generous volume and some side tread for chunky terrain with a smooth center tread to keep the speed,” Zack Allison said. Beneath the tread, the speedy, supple, and durable 120tpi SG TCS tubeless-ready casing enhances ride comfort, offers ample protection, and keeps weight to an absolute minimum. “This tire puts the fun in gravel. I ran this thing across Colombia this spring for 60 hours in 8 days and had zero issues. In fact, I still am running it,” Whitney Allison said.</p>\n<p>The 700c Vulpine S is available in 40mm and 45mm widths, in both black and tan sidewalls, for $69.95 / €59.95 / £65.00.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-05-31-WTB-Tyre-Shoot-120.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-05-31-WTB-Tyre-Shoot-120.jpg?w=1999&amp;quality=75 1999w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-05-31-WTB-Tyre-Shoot-120.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-05-31-WTB-Tyre-Shoot-120.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-05-31-WTB-Tyre-Shoot-120.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-05-31-WTB-Tyre-Shoot-38.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-05-31-WTB-Tyre-Shoot-38.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-05-31-WTB-Tyre-Shoot-38.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-05-31-WTB-Tyre-Shoot-38.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-05-31-WTB-Tyre-Shoot-38.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-05-31-WTB-Tyre-Shoot-90.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-05-31-WTB-Tyre-Shoot-90.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-05-31-WTB-Tyre-Shoot-90.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-05-31-WTB-Tyre-Shoot-90.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-05-31-WTB-Tyre-Shoot-90.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.wtb.com/collections/gravel-cx/products/vulpine\" target=\"_blank\">Vulpine 45 – A Bigger Version of an All-Around Gravel Classic</a></h3>\n<p>Gravel riders love the Vulpine tread for its blend of efficiency and confident traction.

For tires, it’s often been a matter of sacrificing one characteristic for another. Not anymore. The new WTB Macro 2.4” tire shatters that trend. It rolls fast, digs into the turns with precision, and deflects even the sharpest rocks thanks to its SG puncture protection.</p>\n<p>Macro’s centerline is made up of small, tightly spaced knobs that pack a punch, delivering unmatched speed and braking traction. When you lean into a turn, the wider spacing and raised outer knobs provide steadfast grip when you need it most. Pair this dynamic tread with a wide, rounded profile and the ability to run lower air pressures, and you get an incredibly capable tire that delivers a perfectly smooth transition as you pitch in and rail through turns.</p>\n<p>“There are some good XC tires out there that excel in certain areas,” said WTB Product Vision and OEM Director Johs Huseby. “Some are fast in a straight line, some bite well in corners, some are light, and some feature robust protection. Macro puts all those characteristics into a single tire.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-01-at-10.51.09%E2%80%AFAM.png?fit=1200,1041&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The true 2.4” tire measures 62mm and weighs a scant 732g (120tpi black with SG protection). Part of the secret sauce is WTB’s SG puncture protection, made of a rubberized nylon fabric that protects the sidewalls without compromising suppleness. The use of flat fibers in the SG barrier reduces weight compared to traditional round fibers and allows WTB to tune the ride characteristics even further.</p>\n<p>The Macro is available in both Black and Tan casing options and with an MSRP of $76.95 / €69.95 / £75.00.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1716\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/DSC04218.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/DSC04218.jpg?w=1716&amp;quality=75 1716w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/DSC04218.jpg?resize=1200,932&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/DSC04218.jpg?resize=768,597&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/DSC04218.jpg?resize=1536,1193&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Sustainably Packaged and Available Now</h3>\n<p>All new WTB tires are packaged using 100% recycled materials and zero plastic available at <a href=\"https://www.wtb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WTB.com</a> and dealers across the USA now and will be on shelves across Europe in late July.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/new-wtb-tires-lighter-faster-stronger/\">New WTB Tires: Lighter, Faster, Stronger.</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"e83dcd993a2b13186f5dd0f7e8f798288b3ea91c8466489a97f81af17bf1a9d8","category":"Cycling"}
