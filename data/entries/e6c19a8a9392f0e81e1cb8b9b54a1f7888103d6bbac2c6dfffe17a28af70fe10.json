Customers with the Lightning-based ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 had no upgrade path, but those who want to have USB-C charging across all of their devices can now pay a $99 fee to get the new version.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe USB-C Charging Case is compatible with the second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌. It continues to offer ‌MagSafe‌ charging as well, just like the Lightning model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to a USB-C port, the USB-C Charging Case also provides improved IP54 dust resistance, but it will not add lossless audio for the Vision Pro, which is a feature added to the updated ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 that come with the USB-C Charging Case. <br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/13/apple-selling-standalone-usb-c-airpods-pro-case/\">Apple Now Selling Standalone USB-C AirPods Pro Case for $99</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-selling-standalone-usb-c-airpods-pro-case-for-99.2413617/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e6c19a8a9392f0e81e1cb8b9b54a1f7888103d6bbac2c6dfffe17a28af70fe10","category":"Apple"}
