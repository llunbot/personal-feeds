{"title":"How to Pin Links in Apple Messages","link":"https://appleinsider.com/inside/ios-15/tips/how-to-pin-articles-and-images-sent-over-messages-in-ios-15-and-ipados-15","date":1692212514000,"content":"\n<p>Last week I noticed a feature for the first time: the contextual menu for a link or image sent in Messages has a “Pin” command. This is a different form of pinning than pinning an entire thread — it’s just for individual <em>messages</em>, and only messages that are either links <s>or images</s>. I couldn’t figure out what this did until I found this write-up at AppleInsider, which explains the point. When you pin a link, you can refer back to it in the profile details for the contact(s) in that thread. That’s the popover you get by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Tapping the user avatar in the center of the top navigation bar on iOS.</li>\n<li>Clicking the “i”-in-circle Info button on MacOS.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Scroll down in that popover and there’s a section for pins, right above the section showing all photos in the conversation.</p>\n\n<p>Kind of a weirdly obscure feature. I can see using it, maybe, now that I know it’s there. But I never would have guessed it was there, and couldn’t even figure out what “Pin” meant in this context until I searched the web for an answer. [<strong>Update:</strong> The AppleInsider article I’m linking to claims the feature works for images in addition to links, and I originally just took them at their word for that, but it turns out it only works for links. We regret the error. But it just further confirms how unintuitive the feature is.]</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/16/pinned-links-in-messages\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"22a417c9c80bc57d6f4a488180f792bddbd09ec573f2fcb97906ddc82a77a426","category":"Tech"}
