The current A16 chip has a 6-core CPU and a 5-core GPU, so the A17 will bring notable GPU improvements to the new higher-end <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/A17-Feature-Blue.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe A17 chip will feature a 3.70GHz maximum clock rate, up from 3.46GHz in the A16 chip. Notably, the information shared by Unknownz21 suggests that the â€ŒiPhone 15 Proâ€Œ models will feature the same 6GB RAM that's available in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/\">iPhone 14 Pro</a> models. Prior rumors have said the â€ŒiPhone 15 Proâ€Œ and Pro Max <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/21/iphone-15-pro-increased-ram-rumor/\">would have 8GB RAM</a>, which the leaker says is \"unlikely,\" but not impossible.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Apple A17 - t8130 - Coll<br /><br />6 CPU Cores + 6 GPU Cores<br />3.70 GHz<br />6GB LPDDR5 DRAM - Micron/Samsung<br />TSMC 3nm Process<br /><br />LPDDR = Low Power Double Data Rate SDRAM<br /><br />The A17 is used by both the D83 and D84, also likely planned for D47 and D48 (16 series), as the D9x will use t8140 (A18).</p>â€” Unknownz21 ðŸŒˆ (@URedditor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/URedditor/status/1689320339388473352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 9, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nBuilt on a new 3-nanometer process, the A17 chip will bring speed and efficiency improvements to the â€ŒiPhone 15 Proâ€Œ and Pro Max. We should see a decent increase in GPU performance along with faster CPU speeds and perhaps better battery life compared to the A16, which is built on a 4-nanometer process. Performance could increase by 10 to 15 percent, while power consumption could be down by up to 30 percent.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBecause <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/\">3nm</a> technology is new, the A17 chip is expensive to manufacture, which means it will only be available in the â€ŒiPhone 15 Proâ€Œ and â€ŒiPhone 15 Proâ€Œ Max. The standard <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> models will adopt the A16 chip, which is currently limited to the â€ŒiPhone 14 Proâ€Œ and â€ŒiPhone 14 Proâ€Œ Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to unveil the new iPhones in September, and current signs suggest the â€ŒiPhoneâ€Œ event will be held on Tuesday, September 12.
