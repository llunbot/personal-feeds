It’s a new year, so why not treat your fingers to some new gloves. Both get durable softshell construction &amp; water-resistant treatment. So you just have to decide if you need protection from bashing into rocks &amp; trees, or from cold winds…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2020, Muc-Off continued to expand their line-up of <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/mtb-clothing-roundup-muc-off-club-ride-threads-for-men-womens-kids-gear-from-ride-force-skidz/\" target=\"_blank\">technical riding gear</a>. And with the addition of more foul weather kit about a year and a half ago, we wondered when cold and shoulder season gloves might catch up. That time has come.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Muc-Off D3O Rider Gloves for technical mountain biking</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-D3O-Rider-Gloves-deliver-impact-protection-for-aggressive-mountain-biking_up-close.jpg\" alt=\"Muc-Off D3O Rider Gloves deliver impact protection for aggressive mountain biking, up close\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-D3O-Rider-Gloves-deliver-impact-protection-for-aggressive-mountain-biking_up-close.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-D3O-Rider-Gloves-deliver-impact-protection-for-aggressive-mountain-biking_up-close-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-D3O-Rider-Gloves-deliver-impact-protection-for-aggressive-mountain-biking_up-close-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-D3O-Rider-Gloves-deliver-impact-protection-for-aggressive-mountain-biking_up-close-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-D3O-Rider-Gloves-deliver-impact-protection-for-aggressive-mountain-biking_up-close-768x461.jpg 768w\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>(Photos/Muc-Off)</figcaption>        <div>\n                \n                    \n                \n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Muc-Off D3O Rider Gloves deliver impact protection for aggressive mountain biking, up close\" /><figcaption>(Photos/Muc-Off)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Muc-Off D3O Rider Gloves deliver impact protection for aggressive mountain biking, up close\" /><figcaption>(Photos/Muc-Off)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n                <div></div>\n        </div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new D3O gloves are simple. Stick a thin ‘shear thickening’ D3O protector in between 2 layers of fabric over your knuckles. It stays soft &amp; flexible as you ride. But at the moment of impact, the almost-magic orange D3O protector stiffens, distributing the impact over a greater area of your hand to minimize the risk of injury.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-D3O-Rider-Gloves-deliver-impact-protection-for-aggressive-mountain-biking_vented-palm-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Muc-Off D3O Rider Gloves deliver impact protection for aggressive mountain biking, perforated palm\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-D3O-Rider-Gloves-deliver-impact-protection-for-aggressive-mountain-biking_vented-palm-detail.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-D3O-Rider-Gloves-deliver-impact-protection-for-aggressive-mountain-biking_vented-palm-detail-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-D3O-Rider-Gloves-deliver-impact-protection-for-aggressive-mountain-biking_vented-palm-detail-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-D3O-Rider-Gloves-deliver-impact-protection-for-aggressive-mountain-biking_vented-palm-detail-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-D3O-Rider-Gloves-deliver-impact-protection-for-aggressive-mountain-biking_vented-palm-detail-768x461.jpg 768w\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t        <div>\n                \n                    \n                \n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Muc-Off D3O Rider Gloves deliver impact protection for aggressive mountain biking, perforated palm\" /></figure>\n</div>\n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Muc-Off D3O Rider Gloves deliver impact protection for aggressive mountain biking, perforated palm\" /></figure>\n</div>\n                <div></div>\n        </div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Muc-Off makes the D3O Rider Gloves from a thin 2-layer stretch softshell fabric, with an abrasion-resistant outer layer. That makes them best-suited for cool weather riding. The D3O protector itself is thin and perforated to let your hand move unrestricted, but also to breathe well. On the outside, a DWR water-resistant coating keeps raindrops at bay. And an extended neoprene cuff keeps cold winds out. They aren’t quite cold winter gloves though, with a tough perforated synthetic microfiber palm that features silicone printed dots for grip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The D3O gloves are touch-screen-ready, with special conductive index &amp; thumb fingertips so you can snap pics and text your riding buddies. Plus, a soft microfiber wrap-around thumb for nose wiping.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Muc-Off D3O Rider Gloves – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-D3O-Rider-Gloves-deliver-impact-protection-for-aggressive-mountain-biking_colors-back-and-palm.jpg\" alt=\"Muc-Off D3O Rider Gloves deliver impact protection for aggressive mountain biking, colors\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-D3O-Rider-Gloves-deliver-impact-protection-for-aggressive-mountain-biking_colors-back-and-palm.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-D3O-Rider-Gloves-deliver-impact-protection-for-aggressive-mountain-biking_colors-back-and-palm-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-D3O-Rider-Gloves-deliver-impact-protection-for-aggressive-mountain-biking_colors-back-and-palm-800x400.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-D3O-Rider-Gloves-deliver-impact-protection-for-aggressive-mountain-biking_colors-back-and-palm-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-D3O-Rider-Gloves-deliver-impact-protection-for-aggressive-mountain-biking_colors-back-and-palm-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-D3O-Rider-Gloves-deliver-impact-protection-for-aggressive-mountain-biking_colors-back-and-palm-1536x768.jpg 1536w\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t        <div>\n                \n                    \n                \n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Muc-Off D3O Rider Gloves deliver impact protection for aggressive mountain biking, colors\" /></figure>\n</div>\n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Muc-Off D3O Rider Gloves deliver impact protection for aggressive mountain biking, colors\" /></figure>\n</div>\n                <div></div>\n        </div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new D3O gloves come in a 6 size range (XS-XXL), and in two gray-on-black colorways – Bolt or Punk – each with pink accents and silicone palm grippers. They are available now for $50 / 55€, officially as a pre-order. That means, buy now and expect the new gloves to start shipping direct to you in the last week of January.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Winter Rider Gloves, too!</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_on-the-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Muc-Off Winter Rider Gloves offer Thinsulate insulation for MTB weather protection, up close\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_on-the-bike.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_on-the-bike-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_on-the-bike-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_on-the-bike-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_on-the-bike-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_on-the-bike-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t        <div>\n                \n                    \n                \n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Muc-Off Winter Rider Gloves offer Thinsulate insulation for MTB weather protection, up close\" /></figure>\n</div>\n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Muc-Off Winter Rider Gloves offer Thinsulate insulation for MTB weather protection, up close\" /></figure>\n</div>\n                <div></div>\n        </div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this season, Muc-Off also added a new pair of Winter Rider Gloves, too. Muc-Off developed them to keep your fingers toasty &amp; warm in cool-to-cold riding conditions, just above freezing. Low bulk insulation was the priority to maximize finger dexterity and the feel of your bar. Plus, a nice thin fleece-lined synthetic palm for a cozy feel inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_DWR-coating.jpg\" alt=\"Muc-Off Winter Rider Gloves offer Thinsulate insulation for MTB weather protection, DWR coated\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_DWR-coating.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_DWR-coating-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_DWR-coating-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_DWR-coating-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_DWR-coating-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_DWR-coating-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_DWR-coating-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking to make a lightweight MTB glove, they sandwiched some Thinsulate insulation into a light softshell for riding between 3-9°C /37-48°F. Then, on top of that, an extended neoprene cuff keeps out the cold wind. And a DWR water-resistant coating will shed a light bout of freezing rain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Muc-Off promises “ultra-durable construction” to survive winter-after-winter abuse. Into the details, the Muc-Off Winter Rider Gloves also feature touch-screen-compatible tips for your index finger and thumb – so you can Instagram those winter rides. Plus, that same soft microfiber on the outside of the thumb to wipe off your dripping nose &amp; sweaty brow.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_palm-and-back.jpg\" alt=\"Muc-Off Winter Rider Gloves offer Thinsulate insulation for MTB weather protection, back &amp; palm\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_palm-and-back.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_palm-and-back-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_palm-and-back-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_palm-and-back-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_palm-and-back-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Winter-Rider-Gloves-offer-Thinsulate-insulation-for-MTB-weather-protection_palm-and-back-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t        <div>\n                \n                    \n                \n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Muc-Off Winter Rider Gloves offer Thinsulate insulation for MTB weather protection, back &amp; palm\" /></figure>\n</div>\n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Muc-Off Winter Rider Gloves offer Thinsulate insulation for MTB weather protection, back &amp; palm\" /></figure>\n</div>\n                <div></div>\n        </div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Muc-Off Winter Rider Gloves are available now for $59 / 60€, in the same 6-size run (XS-XXL).
