There are issues with a third-party battery cell that “may\npose a fire safety risk,” the company wrote in an email to\ncustomers (including The Verge’s David Pierce, who <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24126502/humane-ai-pin-review\">reviewed it\nwhen it came out</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Humane says it has “disqualified” that vendor and is moving to\nfind another supplier. It also specified that the AI Pin itself,\nthe magnetic Battery Booster, and its charging pad are “not\naffected.” As recompense, the company is offering two free months\nof its subscription service, which is required for most of its\nfunctionality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ugh. I’m all for <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/24/humane-is-for-sale\">cracking jokes</a> at Humane’s expense, but this news fills me with nothing but sincere empathy for everyone at the company. Hardware is so fucking hard. I’m glad that there’s seemingly no news of any actual incidents or injuries, and hope there aren’t any.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/05/humane-charging-case-fire-risk\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"09793ad5c04292199a240263eaa794ca8350db2afbe591ceb4a68cc8fbcce1de","category":"Tech"}
