It offered a communal stargazing experience that takes our ubiquitous smartphones and turns them into a way to view the heavens. Unistellar's newest offering is the <a href=\"https://fave.co/3OnkCka\" target=\"_blank\">eQuinox 2,</a> a lower-cost alternative to <a href=\"https://fave.co/3DD92w2\" target=\"_blank\">eVscope 2</a>, taking all of the features from its original telescope, improving the technology, and dropping the price to $2,499.</p>\n<p>Unistellar's smart telescopes are designed to make astronomy more accessible by automating skywatching and using digital sensors to \"collect\" light from faraway objects, making light pollution a small nuisance instead of a deal-breaker.</p>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/catalog.jpg\" alt /></div>\n          <p>\n            Unistellar's catalog contains over 5,000 celestial objects.                          [credit:\n                              Eric Bangeman/Ars Technica                            ]\n                      </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n<p>At a glance, the biggest difference between the eQuinox 2 and its predecessor is the former's lack of an eyepiece. Unistellar got rid of the eyepiece, which isn't much of a loss. Instead of taking turns peering through the eyepiece, up to 10 people can stargaze simultaneously with the Unistellar app. Connect to the telescope's built-in Wi-Fi network, launch the app, and you're ready to scan the skies. One person controls the telescope and everyone else can watch. The operator can give control of the telescope to anyone else easily.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1957544#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1957544&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Bangeman","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0555bda901d7856f12155fe02bb2d5ae61e391a40ef14913fbf5e7cf6ffdc6f0","category":"Tech"}
