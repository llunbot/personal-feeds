The attackers then used their control of the devices to poison domain name system responses for legitimate hostnames providing updates for at least six different apps written for Windows or macOS. The apps affected were the 5KPlayer, Quick Heal, Rainmeter, Partition Wizard, and those from Corel and Sogou.</p>\n<h2>These aren’t the update servers you’re looking for</h2>\n<p>Because the update mechanisms didn’t use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security\">TLS</a> or cryptographic signatures to authenticate the connections or downloaded software, the threat actors were able to use their control of the ISP infrastructure to successfully perform <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack\">machine-in-the-middle</a> (MitM) attacks that directed targeted users to hostile servers rather than the ones operated by the affected software makers. These redirections worked even when users employed non-encrypted public DNS services such as Google’s 8.8.8.8 or Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 rather than the authoritative DNS server provided by the ISP.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041175#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041175&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2456e556c66698340017ecdf21bb92f1cde6910529875fb698cf24dae46d49a7","category":"Tech"}
