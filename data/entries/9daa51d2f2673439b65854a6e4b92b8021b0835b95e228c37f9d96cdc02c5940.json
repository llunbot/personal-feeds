The mission carried an eclectic mix of passengersâ€”billionaire Jeff Bezos and his brother Mark, famed female aviator Wally Funk, and 18-year-old Oliver Daemen.</p>\n<p>All four emerged from the capsule, in the west Texas desert, less than 20 minutes later. During the flight they reached an altitude of 107 km, crossing the internationally agreed upon boundary of space.</p>\n<p>This was Blue Origin's first human spaceflight and follows Virgin Galactic's successful flight of its founder, Sir Richard Branson, nine days ago. We truly have entered into a new era of human spaceflight.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1781283#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1781283&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9daa51d2f2673439b65854a6e4b92b8021b0835b95e228c37f9d96cdc02c5940","category":"Tech"}
