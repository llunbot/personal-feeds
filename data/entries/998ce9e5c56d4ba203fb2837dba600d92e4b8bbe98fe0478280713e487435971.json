If authentic, the images are the first to be shared of the ‌iPhone 16‌'s components.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe battery is said to be designed for an early stage ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro prototype with a 3,355 mAh capacity. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> contains a 3,274 mAh battery, meaning that prototype ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro models currently feature a battery that is just 2.5% larger. The new battery also features a redesigned connector.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Battery of early stage iPhone 16 Pro Proto<br />Features glossy metal shell, 3355mAh Capacity(13.02Wh), LCV 4.48V(Limited Charge Voltage)<br />Current stage prototype has changed some design: from glossy surface to frosted metal shell, and with a redesigned connector<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Apple</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/appleinternal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#appleinternal</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/QvguZ7CrtL\">pic.twitter.com/QvguZ7CrtL</a></p>— Kosutami (@KosutamiSan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KosutamiSan/status/1726430084838617152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 20, 2023</a></blockquote> </div> \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe most significant change is the transition from a black foil casing, the likes of which have been used on every <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> model thus far, to a frosted metal shell. This change improves the thermal efficiency of the battery, with no significant impact on the component's weight. The Apple Watch used to feature batteries with black foil casing, but starting with the 40mm Apple Watch Series 7, Apple began adopting metal shells for improved thermals.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-watch-40mm-battery-change-ifixit.jpg\" width=\"1922\" height=\"1133\" /><em>The new and old Apple Watch battery designs (via iFixit).</em></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe early component images appear to confirm information <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/iphone-16-new-thermal-design/\">shared last week</a> that said Apple plans to introduce a new thermal system on the ‌iPhone 16‌ to reduce overheating. In addition to batteries with metal shells on the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro models, the entire ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup is rumored to feature a graphene heat-sink to reduce overheating. Graphene has high thermal conductivity, surpassing that of copper, which is currently used in ‌iPhone‌ heat-sinks. Apple has been interested in graphene for thermal management for some time, filing patents related to its exploration of the material for heat dissipation in portable devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe moves appear to come partly in response to widely encountered <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/iphone-15-pro-overheating-reports/\">overheating issues</a> experienced with the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌, which Apple ostensibly addressed through a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-releases-ios-17-0-3/\">software update</a> earlier this year.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/\">Kosutami</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/iphone-16-pro-leak-reveals-redesigned-battery/\">First Alleged iPhone 16 Pro Component Leak Reveals Redesigned Battery</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-alleged-iphone-16-pro-component-leak-reveals-redesigned-battery.2411505/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"998ce9e5c56d4ba203fb2837dba600d92e4b8bbe98fe0478280713e487435971","category":"Apple"}
