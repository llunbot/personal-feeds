Sources that spoke to Gurman said that with the upcoming software updates, the software engineering management team working under Federighi found too many bugs that were missed in internal testing, leading to a week-long sprint to address the issues.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDuring that week period, all development on future features was stopped to allow engineers to work solely on improving the existing software. Apple is lifting the pause this week so that work on new capabilities for iOS 18 and its sister updates can continue.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple last month finished the first \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a>\" versions of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15. Work on further development was paused, with Apple also taking a brief break from working on iOS 17.4, expected to be released next March. Given that work on future software was only paused for a week, no release delays are expected next year. <br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-engineers-ios-18-bug-fix-focus/\">Apple Briefly Paused Work on New Features for iOS 18 and macOS 15 to Clean Up Bugs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-briefly-paused-work-on-new-features-for-ios-18-and-macos-15-to-clean-up-bugs.2410180/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0a1fcb72b4fbeb5a6d88113095ef94a933a4c4b5d3bfa016916c8328d2204102","category":"Apple"}
