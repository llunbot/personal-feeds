The car then hit a drainage culvert and a raised maintenance hole before being stopped by a tree, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/ntsb-finds-no-reason-to-suspect-autopilot-in-fatal-tesla-crash/\">according to an investigation report</a> by the National Transportation Safety Board. At that point, the Tesla promptly burst into flames.</p>\n<p>Firefighters needed four hours to douse the flames, in part because the battery kept reigniting. When the blaze was finally over, about 30,000 gallons of water had been poured on it—what the department <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/federal-regulators-warn-risks-firefighters-electrical-vehicle-fires-n1271084\">normally uses</a> in a month.</p>\n<p>Electric vehicle fires aren’t common, but they’re different enough from fossil-fuel-vehicle fires that firefighters need new approaches.
