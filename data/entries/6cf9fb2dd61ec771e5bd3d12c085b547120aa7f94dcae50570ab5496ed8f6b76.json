If you're also using the Stolen Device Protection and Security Delay feature <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/ios-17-3-adds-multiple-features-originally-planned-for-ios-17/\">introduced in iOS 17.3</a>, this can be a pain, since you need to wait a full hour to turn Find My off after you make the request.</p>\n<p>It looks like Apple is making some changes to that process in iOS 17.5, which is currently in beta testing. The update adds a new \"repair state\" mode that leaves the device functional while keeping both Find My and Activation Lock enabled. This means that iPhones swiped while in transit will still be trackable and that they'll still stay locked to your Apple ID so they can't easily be wiped and resold.</p>\n<p>MacRumors has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/ios-17-5-repair-state/\">a good overview</a> of the feature as it currently functions. You can set an iPhone to repair state mode by pulling it up in the Find My app and attempting to remove the device from your account while itâ€™s still online and active. Rather than removing the device from your account, the app will offer to put it in the repair state instead; unlike when you try to disable Find My entirely, this doesn't trigger the one-hour Security Delay waiting period. If your phone is offline, Find My will offer to remove it from your account, as it currently does.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020956#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020956&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6cf9fb2dd61ec771e5bd3d12c085b547120aa7f94dcae50570ab5496ed8f6b76","category":"Tech"}
