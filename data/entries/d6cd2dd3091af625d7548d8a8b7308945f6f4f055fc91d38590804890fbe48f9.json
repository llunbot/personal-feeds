That would likely first appear as the Main camera in Pro iPhone models, but it's probably a year or two away.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>WhatsApp for iPad Now Available</h2>\r<br />\nIncredibly, one of the biggest news stories of the week was the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/whatsapp-for-ipad-now-available/\">launch of an iPad-optimized version of WhatsApp</a>, more than 15 years after the messaging service debuted. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/26/whatsapp-teases-ipad-app/\">WhatsApp teased the launch</a> early this week, and released the app just a day later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nWith WhatsApp now available for iPad, attention is now on Meta's other major app <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/instagram-ipad-app/\">still lacking a native iPad app, Instagram</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Pulls Some Features From Rumored Smart Home Robot</h2>\r<br />\nApple's rumored smart home tabletop robot has been the subject of some intriguing rumors over the past few years, but <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman says Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/26/apple-smart-home-hub-setback/\">pulling some of the \"bolder features\" planned for it in order to bring it to market faster</a>. The unspecified features could appear in later models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/Apple-Robot-Thumb-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe tabletop robot will reportedly feature an iPad-like display on a robotic arm that can adjust to remain in view of a person moving about the room, and it would be able to respond to voice commands.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe robot is rumored to follow a simpler smart home hub that Gurman says could launch \"by the end of this year at the earliest.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Report: Apple Planned to Offer Starlink-Like Home Internet Service</h2>\r<br />\nA decade ago, Apple reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/apple-planned-home-internet-service/\">explored working with Boeing to launch a Starlink-like satellite internet service</a> for Phones and homes, according to <em>The Information</em>. The companies would have launched thousands of satellites into orbit around the Earth to beam internet services down to the surface.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/Emergency-SOS-via-Satellite-iPhone-YT.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3564\" height=\"1996\" />\r<br />\nThe project was ultimately nixed over concerns related to cost and Apple's relationship with carriers, and the company ultimately partnered with Globalstar on the much more modest satellite services Apple currently offers on recent iPhone models. Just this week, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/messages-via-satellite-mexico/\">expanded Messages and Find My via satellite to Mexico</a>, joining existing coverage in the U.S. and Canada even as the company is reportedly weighing whether it's worth continuing to offer the features as carriers have started to introduce their own satellite services.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iOS 18 Leak Reveals Apple Tested MacBook Pros With M3 Ultra Chip</h2>\r<br />\nWhile Apple's highest-end M3 Ultra chip is currently limited to the Mac Studio, it appears that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/23/ios-18-leak-macbook-pro-m3-ultra-chip/\">Apple tested the chip in the MacBook Pro as well</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-MacBook-Pro-M4-hero.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" />\r<br />\nA user on Chinese social media platform BiliBili claims to have found code references to unreleased 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with the M3 Ultra chip in an internal build of iOS 18 running on an iPhone 16 engineering prototype. Apple of course ultimately did not release an M3 Ultra MacBook Pro, potentially over thermal and/or power concerns, but it's interesting to see that Apple apparently tested the chip in that form factor.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Sony's New WH-1000XM6 Headphones vs. AirPods Max</h2>\r<br />\nSony recently came out with a new set of high-end over-ear noise canceling headphones, so we thought we'd compare them to the AirPods Max to see how Sony's 2025 headphones measure up to Apple's headphones that haven't seen a notable update since their 2020 launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/sony-xm6-airpods-max.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nIn one of our latest YouTube videos, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/23/sony-xm6-vs-airpods-max/\">Dan takes a look at the two sets of headphones</a>, finding that while the AirPods Max offer some key benefits for the Apple ecosystem, Sony's latest headphones deliver a more comfortable fit and a better overall package.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/may-29-2025\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/31/top-stories-ios-26-incoming/\">Top Stories: iOS 26 Incoming?, iPhone 17 Pro Rumors, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-ios-26-incoming-iphone-17-pro-rumors-and-more.2457974/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d6cd2dd3091af625d7548d8a8b7308945f6f4f055fc91d38590804890fbe48f9","category":"Apple"}
