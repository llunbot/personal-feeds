The apps in question charge users unusual fees and siphon revenue from legitimate or higher-quality apps. While Apple has previously come under fire for failing to block apps like these from being published, developers complained this week that Apple was actually actively promoting some of these apps.</p>\n<p>Apple's Australian App Store published a story called \"Slime relaxations\" highlighting a certain category of apps. But <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BeauNouvelle/status/1422941988349825027\">according</a> to some developers and observers, some of those apps have very high subscription fees despite not providing much functionality.</p>\n<p>Take an app with the cumbersome moniker \"Jelly: Slime Simulator, ASMR,\" for example. Unless users subscribe, the app is filled with ads; it plays more than one in succession before allowing the user to interact with it in any meaningful way. A report by MacRumorsÂ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/05/app-store-feature-promotes-rip-off-apps/\">said the app</a> \"features a $13 per week subscription\" to remove those ads. (When we downloaded the app ourselves, we were prompted to subscribe for nearly half that, at $7.99 per week. It's unclear to us whether the prices have changed since the initial reports or if it is a regional pricing difference.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785293#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785293&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bc3db700f2b67a698be8d2df20c6210b4ac7562704a97aa28014a6021ae7cb00","category":"Tech"}
