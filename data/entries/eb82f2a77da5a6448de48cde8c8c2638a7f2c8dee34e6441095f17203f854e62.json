So when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pulled out a 100 g pair of see-through, augmented-reality glasses <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MetaforDevelopers/videos/449444780818091\">at this year's Meta Connect keynote</a>, it represented a bit of a new direction for the company.</p>\n<p>The prototype Orion AR glasses Zuckerberg showed off today don't mean Meta will be ready to release a pair of consumer AR glasses anytime soon. But the demo represents a new vision for lightweight, wide-ranging, see-through smartglasses that Zuckerberg calls \"a glimpse of the future\" and \"the dream of Reality Labs.\"</p>\n<h2>Not your average screen</h2>\n<p>The core challenge of building a pair of comfortable augmented-reality glasses, Zuckerberg said, is that \"they have to be glasses.\" That means no bulky headset (a la Quest), no wires (a la Apple Vision Pro), and a weight of less than 100 grams (compared to a full 515 g for the Meta Quest 3). While there's a tiny battery and \"custom silicon\" in those lightweight glasses, Zuckerberg admitted that some processing is done in a \"small puck\" that connects wirelessly to the glasses themselves.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052383#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052383&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"eb82f2a77da5a6448de48cde8c8c2638a7f2c8dee34e6441095f17203f854e62","category":"Tech"}
