{"title":"Joanna Stern: ‘Google’s Gemini Live AI Sounds So Human, I Almost Forgot It Was a Bot’","link":"https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/google-android-ai-rick-osterloh-apple-iphone-7c06b06e","date":1723935062000,"content":"\n<p>Joanna Stern, writing for The Wall Street Journal (<a href=\"https://apple.news/AkQA2vq1oSOWNHl7NzxCEaA\">News+ link</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I’m not saying I prefer talking to Google’s Gemini Live over a\nreal human. But I’m not <em>not</em> saying that either.</p>\n\n<p>Does it help that the chatty new artificial-intelligence bot says\nI’m a great interviewer with a good sense of humor? <em>Maybe.</em> But\nit’s more that it actually listens, offers quick answers and\ndoesn’t mind my interruptions. No “I’m sorry, I didn’t understand\nthat” apologies like some other bots we know.</p>\n\n<p>I had a nice, long chat with Google’s generative-AI voice\nassistant before its debut on Tuesday. It will come built into the\ncompany’s four new Pixel phones, but it’s also available to anyone\nwith an Android phone, the Gemini app and a $20-a-month\nsubscription to Gemini Advanced. The company <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/googles-new-phones-arent-really-about-the-phones-b50e79f8?mod=article_inline\">plans to launch it\nsoon on iOS, too</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The catch:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When I asked it to set a timer, it said it couldn’t do that — or\nset an alarm — “yet.” Gemini Live is a big step forward\nconversationally. But functionally, it’s a step back in some ways.\nOne big reason: Gemini Live works entirely in the cloud, not\nlocally on a device. Google says it’s working on ways for the new\nassistant to control phone functions and other Google apps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s a fascinating — but unsurprising — strategic and culture difference that Apple Intelligence runs largely on device, and completely privately even when going to the cloud, and Google Gemini is currently <em>only</em> in the cloud, and with nothing like Apple’s Private Cloud Compute. To be clear, Google’s new lineup of Pixel 9 phones perform a lot of “AI” features on device, but not the Gemini voice assistant.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/17/stern-google-gemini\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"115a64374897b296632a073860ea8cb7a3d6bd880c66cde1084ade8833d38a7c","category":"Tech"}
