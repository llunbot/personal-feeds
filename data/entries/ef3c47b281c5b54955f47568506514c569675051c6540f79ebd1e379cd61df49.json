Apple may have chosen these materials in an effort to appear eco-friendly, while simultaneously reducing their carbon footprint through the use of fabric-based leather substitutes. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to Kosutami, the bands are also set to feature a splash-resistant coating, although the bands themselves are not fully waterproof.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to the leaker, Apple created six color options for the FineWoven watch bands, but is only set to announce three of them during the special event today. The exact colors remain unknown at the time of writing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/finewoven-apple-watch-band-official-2.jpg\" alt width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" />\r<br />\nKosutami also clarified that the FineWoven bands would be made by the same manufacturer that makes bands for the AppleWatch Ultra, with the materials allegedly being sourced from Japan.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPrevious rumors have suggested that Apple will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/finewoven-cases-may-match-new-watch-band/\">removing leather options from its assortment of iPhone cases</a>.
