The security features include GPS tracking, auto-lock, unusual movement detection, an alarm system, and additional features to keep your ride safe and secure. When tooling around, you can rely on GPS tracking, 4G connection, and cloud synchronization to get your bike stats in real-time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The smart remote locking lets you immobilize your bike from the Aventon App. Geofencing allows you to define the areas allowed and the distances prohibited. With the startup password and keyless battery, there is one less key on your key ring. Plus, you can activate the locking mechanism that keeps the rear wheel from rotating, adding another level of security.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pace 4 Geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Pace-4-eBike-Cruiser-geo-e1744830859790.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"858\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Pace-4-eBike-Cruiser-geo-e1744830859790.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Pace 4 eBike Cruiser geo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Pace-4-eBike-Cruiser-geo-e1744830859790.webp 858w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Pace-4-eBike-Cruiser-geo-e1744830859790-297x148.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Pace-4-eBike-Cruiser-geo-e1744830859790-120x60.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Pace-4-eBike-Cruiser-geo-e1744830859790-768x382.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pace 4 Retail &amp; Detail</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $1,799</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pace 4 is a class 2 eBike with a range of up to 70 miles.
