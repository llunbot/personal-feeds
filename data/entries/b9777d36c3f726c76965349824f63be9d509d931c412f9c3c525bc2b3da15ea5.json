Last fall, I built up a killer long travel mountain bike that could pedal up as well as it shredded down. It was gonna see a lot of abuse. The ridden hard and put away wet kind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I needed a drivetrain that was: mechanically simple, built tough, but also not so expensive that it wouldn’t break the bank if/when I needed to replace it. I also didn’t want to sacrifice gearing range or shift precision. And frankly, I didn’t want to have to remember to keep it charged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last fall, there really wasn’t anything that checked all those boxes. Today, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-eagle-90-70-mechanical-transmission-mtb-drivetrain-direct-mount/\" target=\"_blank\">Eagle 90 Mechanical</a> changed that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>SRAM Eagle 90 Mechanical is affordable, simple &amp; built tough</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_Scott-Ransom-super-trail-all-mountain-enduro-bike-transformer.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_Scott-Ransom-super-trail-all-mountain-enduro-bike-transformer.webp\" alt=\"SRAM Eagle 90 Mechanical Transmission mountain bike drivetrain Review, Scott Ransom super trail enduro bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_Scott-Ransom-super-trail-all-mountain-enduro-bike-transformer.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_Scott-Ransom-super-trail-all-mountain-enduro-bike-transformer-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_Scott-Ransom-super-trail-all-mountain-enduro-bike-transformer-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_Scott-Ransom-super-trail-all-mountain-enduro-bike-transformer-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_Scott-Ransom-super-trail-all-mountain-enduro-bike-transformer-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(All photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In late 2024, I got ahold of a new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2024-scott-ransom-170mm-6-bar-enduro-mountain-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Ransom</a> frameset to build up into a bike that I could ride the most technical trails I could find.

But at the same time, something that wouldn’t feel overly precious. I knew I was going to bash my derailleur against plenty of rocks, maybe even crash the bike off something stupid. So, I refused to put a 480€ GX AXS electronic derailleur on a bike that was gonna see such abuse. (I don’t even want to think about the 700€ AXS derailleurs that <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-transmission-eagle-mountain-bike-drivetrain/\" target=\"_blank\">debuted the Full Mount</a> that my frame was longing for!) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, I’d already slightly cracked a GX AXS derailleur last season and struggled to figure out what went wrong as it gradually stopped shifting.

No high/low set screws to prevent chains from jumping over the top or off the bottom of your cassette. And much easier shift tuning. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM also touts no more need for a B-screw adjustment, but you still need to get the knurled ring friction plate in the correct place before you start. It’s easy to do, and SRAM has <a href=\"https://www.sram.com/en/learn/eagle-transmission-troubleshooting\" target=\"_blank\">a great troubleshooting page</a> to walk you through how to do it. But I will say that more than half of the Transmission-equipped test bikes I’ve ridden in the past 2 years did not have the knurled ring correctly aligned, whether for not adjusting them correctly from the start in Setup Mode, or just not greasing &amp; torqueing the T-type derailleur to the full 35Nm as required.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>An all-new stealthy mechanical shifter</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_shifter-detail.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_shifter-detail.webp\" alt=\"SRAM Eagle 90 Mechanical Transmission mountain bike drivetrain Review, finally a simple, affordable, tough &amp; serviceable MTB groupset, shifter\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_shifter-detail.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_shifter-detail-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_shifter-detail-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_shifter-detail-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_shifter-detail-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_shifter-detail-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A fancy, rebuildable mechanical derailleur is nothing without a good shifter to actuate it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SRAM Eagle 90 Mechanical Transmission shifter is simple and functional, if a little bit heavy and seemingly bulky.

You can shift one gear at a time under full pedaling load. But to shift multiple gears, you have to ease back on your pedaling inputs, just like all previous non-Transmission/non-LinkGlide drivetrains. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means this 2-Click shifter is not compatible with bikes (which decide on their own when to stop pedaling). And so there’s a separate Single-Click mechanical shifter for eMTB setups.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Burly alloy Eagle 90 crankset with steel chainring</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_forged-alloy-crankset-with-stamped-steel-chainring.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_forged-alloy-crankset-with-stamped-steel-chainring.webp\" alt=\"SRAM Eagle 90 Mechanical Transmission mountain bike drivetrain Review, finally a simple, affordable, tough &amp; serviceable MTB crankset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_forged-alloy-crankset-with-stamped-steel-chainring.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_forged-alloy-crankset-with-stamped-steel-chainring-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_forged-alloy-crankset-with-stamped-steel-chainring-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_forged-alloy-crankset-with-stamped-steel-chainring-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_forged-alloy-crankset-with-stamped-steel-chainring-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_forged-alloy-crankset-with-stamped-steel-chainring-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_forged-alloy-crankset-with-stamped-steel-chainring-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Eagle 90 Transmission crankset is a burly, no-nonsense affair.

Not here on the scale, my full-length 4mm shifter outer housing added an extra 45g. That makes for a 577g grand total to shift mechanically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m a little surprised that that is somehow heavier than the 539g shift system weight for <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-gx-eagle-transmission-t-type-review/\" target=\"_blank\">T-type GX AXS</a> (a 492g derailleur), the 521g system weight for X0 AXS (474g derailleur), or the 491g combined weight of XX SL AXS (444g derailleur) from the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-transmission-eagle-mountain-bike-drivetrain/\" target=\"_blank\">first batch of T-type</a> including their 47g AXS Pod Controllers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know it comes down to heavier metal components to align with the cheaper price point here. But it hurts a bit to see this heavier than all those wireless AXS shift setups when Eagle 90’s weight doesn’t include two batteries, a powerful little electric motor, or electronic control systems. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess that just means Dangerholm will have a lot to work with when he gets around to tuning one of these for his next ultra custom build.

Buy a $190/205€ 90 derailleur, $50/55€ 90 shifter, $30/35€ 70 chain, a $215-250/240-300€ 1275 or 1270 cassette depending on your current wheels, and $18-20/20-22€ 70 or 90 chainring depending on your current cranks. A minimum upgrade cost of $503/55€.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(It’s wild that the most expensive thing in this new group is the carry-over T-type cassettes from <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-gx-eagle-transmission-t-type-review/\" target=\"_blank\">GX</a> or <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-adds-a-more-affordable-eagle-transmission-group-for-oe-only-plus-new-brakes/\" target=\"_blank\">S1000</a>, right?)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Next to notice was how simple it was to put this on the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no set screws and no derailleur hangers, you just bolt this puppy to your bike and go. SRAM calls it “prepare, hang, tighten”. Their app will help you set your chain length, or you just do it old school like me. Then you hang the derailleur loose in its setup pin position, connect the chain, release the cage spring, and tighten the derailleur into place. Then, simply tension the shift cable and tighten that down, and easy-peasy derailleur adjustment with the shifter’s barrel adjuster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was weirdly quick and easy. Once on the trail, it only required a few quarter turns of that barrel to make shifting perfect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certainly the easiest mechanical derailleur setup I’ve installed in the last 30 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>On Trail Riding Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_trail-chain-tension.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_trail-chain-tension.webp\" alt=\"SRAM Eagle 90 Mechanical Transmission mountain bike drivetrain Review, finally a simple, affordable, tough &amp; serviceable MTB groupset, riding into spring\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_trail-chain-tension.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_trail-chain-tension-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_trail-chain-tension-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_trail-chain-tension-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_trail-chain-tension-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_trail-chain-tension-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_trail-chain-tension-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Out on the trail, it just works. Shifts are crisp, with positive lever feedback. And it was easy to fine-tune.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eagle 90 Mechanical just does its job, delivering the same shifting and riding feel as GX AXS Transmission. It feels the same because you have the same chainring, flattop chain, and the exact same XS-1275 Transmission cassette with the same shift points and ramps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest difference compared to the electronic T-Type drivetrains is that the Eagle 90 setup here on a pedal-powered bike actually shifts quicker, with more positive shift feedback at your thumb. Since mine isn’t an eMTB-approved shifter, I get 2 shifts with one throw of the lever, which I really appreciate when I’m about to quickly go up hill and want to dump a bunch of gears.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_end-of-winter-riding.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_end-of-winter-riding.webp\" alt=\"SRAM Eagle 90 Mechanical Transmission mountain bike drivetrain Review, finally a simple, affordable, tough &amp; serviceable MTB groupset, riding out of winter\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_end-of-winter-riding.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_end-of-winter-riding-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_end-of-winter-riding-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_end-of-winter-riding-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_end-of-winter-riding-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_end-of-winter-riding-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_end-of-winter-riding-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, there’s the durability – both real and perceived. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After wheels probably, the rear derailleur is the single component that sees the most abuse, how and where I ride. Almost every season, I have to replace an MTB derailleur cage, or at least bend one back into shape. It’s reassuring that if I do break this thing, it will be easy to get replacement parts for it. And even if I had to replace the whole thing, it’s not all that expensive either.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Parting thoughts on Eagle 90 Mechanical Review</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_in-corn-snow.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_in-corn-snow.webp\" alt=\"SRAM Eagle 90 Mechanical Transmission mountain bike drivetrain Review, finally a simple, affordable, tough &amp; serviceable MTB groupset, in corn snow\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_in-corn-snow.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_in-corn-snow-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_in-corn-snow-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_in-corn-snow-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_in-corn-snow-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_in-corn-snow-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-Transmission-mountain-bike-drivetrain-Review_affordable-simple-tough-serviceable_in-corn-snow-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Look, the new SRAM Eagle 90 Mechanical Transmission isn’t entirely perfect. I’d love to see the derailleur and shifter to each be a bit lighter. There’s no reason besides market positioning that SRAM couldn’t have made this lighter than a GX AXS shifter/derailleur combo, what with no batteries or electric motors to account for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And realistically, Eagle 90 would pair really well with an XX crankset for more weight savings and a more premium feel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what makes this groupset great is so hard to argue with: no batteries to charge, no firmware to keep up to date, and much more affordable pricing. Just simple classic cable-actuated shifts. A solid direct Full Mount install that requires very little setup adjustment. And now with a robust modular construction that should be easy to keep running for years to come!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sram.com/en/sram\" target=\"_blank\"><em>SRAM.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-sram-eagle-90-mechanical-is-the-exact-mountain-bike-group-i-was-waiting-for/\">Review: SRAM Eagle 90 Mechanical is the Exact Mountain Bike Group I Was Waiting For</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b9777d36c3f726c76965349824f63be9d509d931c412f9c3c525bc2b3da15ea5","category":"Cycling"}
