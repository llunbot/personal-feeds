This test is a small but meaningful step \ntowards making Threads interoperable with other apps using \nActivityPub — we’re committed to doing this so that people can \nfind community and engage with the content most relevant to them, \nno matter what app they use. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And behold, you can now follow @mosseri@threads.net from any Mastodon instance who administrators haven’t <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open\">chosen to preemptively block Threads</a>. When Threads launched this summer, with the stated intention of federating via ActivityPub, there were a lot of naysayers who thought it would never happen. But here we are.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://reb00ted.org/tech/20231208-meta-threads-data-dialogue/\">Johannes Ernst, on his blog</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I participated in a meeting titled “Meta’s Threads Interoperating \nin the Fediverse Data Dialogue” at Meta in San Francisco \nyesterday. It brought together a good number of Meta/Threads \npeople (across engineering, product, policy), some Fediverse \nentrepreneurs like myself, some people who have been involved in \nActivityPub standardization, a good number of industry observers / \ncommentators, at least one journalist, and people from independent \norganizations whose objective is to improve the state of the net. \nAltogether about 30 people. </p>\n\n<p>It was conducted under the Chatham House rule, so I am only \nposting my impressions, and I don’t identify people and what \nspecific people said. [...] </p>\n\n<p>I came away convinced that the team working on Threads indeed \ngenuinely wants to make federation happen, and have it happen in a \n“good” way. I did not get any sense whatsoever that any of the \npeople I interacted were executing any secret agenda, whether \nembrace-and-extend, favoring Threads in some fashion or anything \nlike that. (Of course, that is a limited data point, but I thought \nI convey it anyway.) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/14/threads-has-begun-federating-via-activitypub\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8d0015c9bcde293e6937834023959dea6216c12282fbbd1c60f116c7ea0b32dc","category":"Tech"}
