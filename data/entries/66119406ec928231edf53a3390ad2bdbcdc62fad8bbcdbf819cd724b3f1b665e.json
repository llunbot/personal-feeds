Let’s\nkeep the blame for “spoiling” any election where it be longs — with the people who voted.</p>\n\n<p>Largely, however, I think these theories are promoted by political\njournalists as a means of protecting their own hoary narratives of\npresidential politics. Here’s mine: It’s chaotic. It’s weird.\nNobody knows anything. Thus, evaluating the candidates through the\ndesign &amp; typography of their campaign websites is as valid a\nmethod as any.
