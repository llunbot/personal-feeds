But if the latest rumor is to be believed, you shouldn’t get your hopes up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/vnchocotaco/status/1769727515453800930?s=61&amp;t=TXFJXRMnjxl-gg_wTr7F0g&amp;xcust=1-1-2274846-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">ShrimpApplePro on X</a> (formerly Twitter), “only one size (of the iPad Air 6) has been seen, which is 10.9 inches.””” If that’s not clear enough, they go on to say, “So there likely won’t be a bigger size available.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve been hearing for months that Apple is planning to launch a larger 12.9-inch iPad Air as a cheaper alternative to the flagship iPad Pro. If released, the larger Air will reportedly have the same design, features, and specs as the 10.9-inch model but with a larger display. Several notable sources have claimed Apple will release a larger Air, including Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman and 9to5Mac, which published specs of the new model. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>ShrimpApplePro also <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2262063/2024-ipad-air-pro-camera-landscape-orientation.html\">repeats previous claims</a> that the iPad Air will feature the “addition of a new landscape selfie camera,” one of the most-requested iPad changes. Apple introduced a landscape camera with the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1371039/ipad-10th-generation-review.html\">10th-gen iPad</a> in 2022 but hasn’t changed the placement on any of the other models. ShrimpApplePro says otherwise the iPad Air 6 “doesn’t seem to have a significant redesign.” It will, however, get a different color palette, with “either blue or pink will most likely be eliminated from the five existing colors.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is also expected to launch a new iPad Pro with an OLED display and M3 processor.
