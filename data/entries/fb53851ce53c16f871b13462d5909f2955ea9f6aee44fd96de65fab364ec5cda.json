It's on the larger end of the midsize SUV segment, bigger than I like them, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/lincoln-corsair-phev-review-nice-design-but-too-many-rattles-and-squeaks/\">my last encounter with a Lincoln</a> wasn't entirely positive. And then there's the whole giant screen. Not to be outdone by Cadillac and its 33-inch display, Nautilus has a 48-inch screen that stretches between the A pillars, which sounds like a recipe for distraction. And yet, this hybrid SUV won me over rapidly.</p>\n<p>We tested the hybrid Nautilus, a $1,500 option for a model that starts at $50,415. The hybrid system combines a 2.0 L turbocharged four-cylinder direct-injection engine with an electric motor in parallel, sending torque to all four wheels via a continuously variable transmission. Total output is 310 hp (231 kW), with a maximum output of 300 hp (223 kW) from the internal combustion engine, or 134 hp (100 kW) from the electric motor.</p>\n<p>It's quite efficient, too. The EPA rates the hybrid Nautilus at a combined 30 mpg (7.84 L/100 km), although a combination of 22-inch wheels and oppressive Washington, DC, summer temperatures meant that I averaged a little bit less than that.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035255#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035255&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
