{"title":"Humane Is for Sale, But Who Would Buy Them?","link":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-22/wearable-ai-startup-humane-is-said-to-explore-potential-sale","date":1716587536000,"content":"\n<p>Liana Baker, Mark Gurman, Shirin Ghaffary, and Katie Roof, reporting for Bloomberg:<sup>*</sup></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Artificial intelligence startup Humane Inc. has been seeking a\nbuyer for its business, according to people familiar with the\nmatter, just weeks after the company’s closely watched wearable AI\ndevice had a rocky public launch. [...] Humane is seeking a price\nof between $750 million and $1 billion in a sale, one person said.\nThe process is still early and may not result in a deal.</p>\n\n<p>Last year it was valued by investors at $850 million, according to\ntech news site <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/has-humane-created-the-next-iphone-or-the-next-google-glass?rc=4kqywh\">the Information</a>. The company has raised $230\nmillion to date from a roster of high-profile investors including\nOpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I suspect they’ll sell for a pittance — way less than the $230 million they’ve raised. I just don’t see what they have to offer. Humane doesn’t own the AI that powers the AI Pin — that comes from OpenAI, which seemingly not only doesn’t want to buy Humane, but is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/28/23893939/jony-ive-openai-sam-altman-iphone-of-artificial-intelligence-device\">supposedly in exploratory talks</a> with Jony Ive’s LoveFrom to design and build their own AI devices. The laser projector idea seems to be a bust, and the hardware’s battery life is measured in hours between battery pack swaps.</p>\n\n<p>Off the top of my head, the only company that could afford a $1 billion-ish price for Humane <em>and</em> <a href=\"https://www.cio.com/article/304397/the-hp-autonomy-lawsuit-timeline-of-an-ma-disaster.html\">is dumb enough</a> to do it is HP.</p>\n\n<p><small>* Bloomberg, of course, is the publication that published “<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2018/10/bloomberg_the_big_hack\">The Big Hack</a>” in October 2018 — a sensational story alleging that data centers of Apple, Amazon, and dozens of other companies were compromised by China’s intelligence services. The story presented no confirmable evidence <em>at all</em>, was <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/10/what-businessweek-got-wrong-about-apple/\">vehemently denied</a> by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/setting-the-record-straight-on-bloomberg-businessweeks-erroneous-article/\">all companies</a> involved, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2018/10/22/your-move-bloomberg/\">has not been confirmed by a single other publication</a> (despite much effort to do so), and has been <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/10/09/big-hack-doubts\">largely discredited by one of Bloomberg’s own sources</a>. By all appearances “The Big Hack” was complete bullshit. Yet Bloomberg has issued no correction or retraction, and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/12/bloomberg-big-con\">their only ostensibly substantial follow-up</a> contained not one shred of evidence to back up their allegations. Bloomberg seemingly hopes we’ll all just forget about it. I say we do not just forget about it. Everything they publish should be treated with skepticism until they retract “The Big Hack” or provide evidence that <em>any of it</em> was true.</small></p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/24/humane-is-for-sale\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8674d0b7cfb381dc0a8dffdcf4d33b555a07cc2a08958c133f30e4ae331aaa00","category":"Tech"}
