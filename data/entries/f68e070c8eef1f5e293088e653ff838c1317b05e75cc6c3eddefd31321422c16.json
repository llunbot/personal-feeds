Rather than just listing whether ‌iCloud‌ is on for an app, you can see how much storage space Messages takes up, how many Notes are stored, how many <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> are in ‌iCloud‌, and more. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nTapping into each section provides additional detail and tools for managing storage, much of which was available before. While the main interface no longer shows where the majority of ‌iCloud‌ storage is going by file type, tapping the Storage bar shows the full breakdown and list of apps using the most storage. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you subscribe to ‌iCloud‌+, there's a new \"Subscriber Edition\" icon, which is similar to the icon that Apple uses for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/\">Apple News</a>+. ‌iCloud‌+ features can be listed and managed through the ‌iCloud‌+ section.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's also a more prominent \"Recommended For You\" suggestions interface that recommends things like deleting inactive backups, upgrading to a new ‌iCloud‌+ plan, and more, along with quicker access to ‌iCloud‌ backups.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/icloud-interface-overhaul-ios-18/\">iCloud Interface Gets Overhaul in iOS 18</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/icloud-interface-gets-overhaul-in-ios-18.2428927/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f68e070c8eef1f5e293088e653ff838c1317b05e75cc6c3eddefd31321422c16","category":"Apple"}
