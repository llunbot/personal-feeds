The parties have not executed any definitive agreement.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Why would Giant purchase the US-based Stages Cycling? It comes down to the increasing popularity of indoor cycling. Most are likely familiar with their SB20 smart indoor bike for home and individual usage, but Stages also sells a myriad of indoor bikes for commercial use for gyms, hotels, and more. </span></p>\n<p><span>Further, the Giant Group has previously partnered to manufacture some of Stages’ indoor bikes. More recently the two companies have worked together to produce the latest 200 series of Stages GPS head units. </span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/stages_rouvy_rider2_820x615_1_.jpeg?width=730\" alt=\"stages_rouvy_rider2_820x615_1_\" width=\"820\" height=\"615\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/stages_rouvy_rider2_820x615_1_.jpeg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/stages_rouvy_rider2_820x615_1_.jpeg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption><span>(Image: Stages Cycling)</span></figcaption></figure>","author":"Alvin Holbrook","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"a3488ab5203fe049319e3ba02649c310032a0c2b807e6ea82054d7e8f991dc5b","category":"Cycling"}
