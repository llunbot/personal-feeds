They’re good for tools and snacks, but may limit what else you can carry, although they may include webbing straps for outside carrying.</p>\n<p>There’s a gradation of sizes as you scale up. Some bags are available in multiple sizes with essentially the same design, but different capacities.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Big x Top bar bag\" title=\"Big x Top bar bag\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some bar bags are big enough to carry all your belongings on long excursions – or one cauliflower soft toy.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>One common design has a top opening to access the contents, often supplemented by a sleeve on the lid and maybe side pockets. Bags of this type tend to be quite rigid.</p>\n<p>The other popular design for larger bags is a waterproof dry bag, which sits in a sleeve attached to the bike.</p>\n<p>This is advantageous for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/bikepacking/\">bikepacking</a> because the sleeve can be left on the bike, while you can take the dry bag elsewhere. It’s a good system for carrying a sleeping bag or down jacket, keeping the contents dry but still easy to access when you stop.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Apidura Bar Bag\" title=\"Apidura Bar Bag\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Other bar bags are essentially dry bags, which should keep clothing or camping gear nice and dry.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p><span>Having said this, the sausage shape may interfere with a bike’s </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-bike-handlebars-guide-how-to-choose-the-right-ones/\">drop handlebar</a><span> or brakes. </span>Large handlebar bags may have multiple compartments.

On the one hand, you want enough capacity for your needs. On the other, you don’t want to be riding around with a bag that’s half full – not least because it’s likely to sag and bounce around, and the contents may rattle.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, many bar bags enable you to adjust their volume to match your load, often via compression straps. Many also include adjustable bungee cords, so you can lash a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-waterproof-jackets-for-cyclists/\">jacket</a> to the outside, which has the added benefit of being easy to access when it’s needed.</p>\n<p>If you are mostly going for day rides but make the occasional bikepacking trip, you may want two bags to meet your different capacity needs.</p>\n<h3>Compatibility with your bike</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bar bag on MTB in woods.\" title=\"BiVi Bunker Malvern-8\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Larger bar bags tend to be easier to fit on flat bars – but they can still interfere with grips or levers.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Allen / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The main issue with bar bags is their width relative to your handlebar. If you have a road handlebar, a wider bag may not fit between your drops on a road bike or may interfere with your grips if you have a flat <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-handlebars/\">mountain bike handlebar</a>. It may make using your controls awkward as well.</p>\n<p>Gravel bikes are easier in this regard. <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/gravel-bike-handlebars/\">Gravel bike handlebars</a> are usually wider than road bike bars and flared, so they offer more space and enable you to use the drops more easily, even with a wide bag.</p>\n<p>The other issue, particularly with smaller frame sizes, is that a deeper bag can rub on your front wheel, so you need to ensure there’s adequate clearance, particularly since bags tend to droop once loaded.</p>\n<h3>Mounting system</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Assos Lowenkralle jacket fitted to handlebar\" title=\"Assos Lowenkralle\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Many smaller bags attach with straps and clips.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Many bicycle handlebar bags mount to a handlebar with two straps, usually with a strap further down the bag that passes around the head tube, to help keep the bag stable.</p>\n<p>It’s a system that works well, although it can lead to rubbing on either the bar or the frame, so it’s worth adding some protective tape to your handlebar and around the head tube.</p>\n<p>Straps may be nylon with standard pull-through buckles, clip-together clips or Velcro to keep them in place. In some cases, rubber is used, which has the advantage of being stretchy and grippy, so your bag is less likely to move around as you ride.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ortlieb Handlebar-Pack QR clamp\" title=\"Ortlieb Handlebar-Pack QR clamp\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This Ortlieb bag comes with a handlebar mount and two cords for security.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robyn Furtado / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Any strap system can interfere with brake and gear cables, so it’s common for brands to include spacers, usually made of closed-cell foam, to hold them away from the bar slightly and enable the cables to function.</p>\n<p>Other brands use a separate mount that fits to the bar and to which the bag is attached.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the mount may lift your bag up above the level of your bar, which can help with rigidity, help avoid contact with the front wheel and add extra capacity.</p>\n<h3>Durability</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pete Sampson's gravel Giant TCR (20 of 2)\" title=\"Pete Sampson's gravel Giant TCR (11 of 15)\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This bar bag has a reinforced lid, creating a semi-rigid design.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Larger bags, in particular, tend to be made of heavier-weight fabric, which improves their durability. Often the underside is made of heavy-duty material to make it more durable and weatherproof. A smaller bag can be made of lighter-weight fabric because there’s less weight to carry.</p>\n<p>Some bags have internal reinforcement, with stiffer materials used in some areas, particularly the sections likely to come into contact with the head tube, to help keep them rigid. Others may have further reinforced areas or be semi-rigid.</p>\n<p>Rubbing against the bike can cause wear and some bags have patches of more abrasion-resistant fabric where they come into contact with the frame. Straps are less of a problem if they start to fray because they can usually be replaced.</p>\n<p>Keep an eye out for wear though and replace them before they are too damaged; you don’t want to contend with a broken strap on a long-planned excursion.</p>\n<h3>Waterproofing</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Apidura Backcountry Bar Bag\" title=\"Apidura Backcountry Bar Bag\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some bags have wrap-end closures to prevent water ingress.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robyn Furtado / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Waterproofing is important, even if you’re mainly riding in the dry. Wheel spray can wet out the contents if the road is damp and mud or unavoidable puddles could make a mess of your bar bag’s contents. Left in a damp bag, tools can corrode quickly and you may find your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-multi-tool/\">multi-tool</a> is unusable when you need it.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, most bar bags are made with waterproof fabrics. If a bag has zips, these are usually waterproof to stop water ingress. Some include a separate dry bag, usually with a wrap-end closure to stop water from getting in through the opening.</p>\n<p>To be sure your contents will stay dry, you can use separate dry bags inside your bar bag, which will have the additional advantage of making organising your stuff more manageable.</p>\n<h3>Pockets and accessibility</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Big x Top bar bag\" title=\"Big x Top bar bag\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Extra pockets put essentials within easy reach.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>You may want to be able to access the contents of your handlebar bag while en route, in which case extra side pockets can be useful.</p>\n<p>A dry-bag style bar bag can make it difficult to access the contents quickly because you will have to unwrap the end and there’s usually no internal compartmentation.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Turbo Creo e-gravel bike as ridden by Katherine Moore (Unpaved podcast) during a recce ride of Cycling UK's West Kernow Way, June 2021.
