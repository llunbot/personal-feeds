The latest options from GoPro and Insta360 have incredible specs, and the new DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro brings some serious pro-level tools to the field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike its 5.3K competitors, it maxes out at 4K, but it makes the most of that with a new 13.5-stop dynamic range, 4-hour battery life, subject tracking and centering, and AI-enhanced low-light footage. Basically, it makes it easier to capture great footage no matter when or how you’re shooting, and it’s still full HD 4K. Here’s what you need to know…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro key features</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The main things that set the Osmo Action 5 Pro apart from GoPro and Insta360 are:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Image quality &amp; options</strong><br />It has a large 1/1.3” (0.77″) sensor with a 2.4 μm pixel size and a high dynamic range of up to 13.5 stops. Which basically means it can capture a wider range of light to dark sections without losing detail in either. There are also plenty of manual settings, including 19 steps of +/- EV correction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Color Modes</strong><br />It has two basic color modes for point-and-shoot fun, but pros can switch to 10-bit D-Log M and hybrid log-gamma (HLG) modes for more control over color and output in post-production.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-2-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-2-jpg.webp\" alt=\"subject tracking screenshot of dji osmo action 5 pro action camera.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-2-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-2-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-2-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-2-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-2-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Active Subject Tracking</strong><br />Borrowing a feature from their drones, this cam’s subject tracking automatically detects people in the frame, then helps keep them centered. In the screenshot above, it shows the area being saved in the smaller white box, which moves across the total visible area to keep your subject centered. This helps if you’re riding behind or running alongside someone and can’t always keep it pointed directly at your subject. This is particularly helpful if you’re shooting vertical for social.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sport Data</strong><br />Not only can you import .fit files from GPS trackers like cycling computers, watches, and Apple Watch, but it also has a built-in barometer/hydrometer to internally capture altitude and underwater depth, then make that data available in editing to show off your stats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>47GB Internal Storage</strong><br />You don’t even need to buy a MicroSD card right away, it’ll store a LOT of video on board right out of the box, which is a very cool &amp; unique feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-4-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1638\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-4-jpg.webp\" alt=\"pro kit bundle for dji osmo action 5 pro action camera.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-4-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-4-297x243.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-4-1536x1258.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-4-120x98.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-4-768x629.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dual Touchscreens &amp; Audible Feedback</strong><br />Need to change settings while you’re looking into the camera? No problem, as the full-color front screen is also a touch screen. Need to change modes when it’s stuck to your helmet or chest and can’t see it? Turn on voice response and it’ll tell you what mode it’s in as you swipe and hit buttons out of view.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>More features &amp; specs</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-1-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1345\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-1-jpg.webp\" alt=\"dji osmo action 5 pro action cameras.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-1-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-1-297x200.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-1-1536x1033.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-1-120x81.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-1-768x516.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Other cool features include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Compatibility with wireless DJI Mic 2</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Up to 240 minutes of recording with new 1950mAh batteries</li>\n\n\n\n<li>SuperNight mode that uses AI to minimize noise in low-light</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ultra-bright (and dimmable) OLED screens</li>\n\n\n\n<li>40MP photos</li>\n\n\n\n<li>155º FOV</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4K120fps slow mo in full-screen 4:3 framing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1080p/240fps for super slow motion</li>\n\n\n\n<li>RockSteady and HorizonSteady image stabilization</li>\n\n\n\n<li>20m waterproof out of the box w/ automatic underwater color correction</li>\n\n\n\n<li>15 minute charging yields 2 hours of recording</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Replaceable glass lens</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-3-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1414\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-3-jpg.webp\" alt=\"ND filters and accessories for dji osmo action 5 pro action camera.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-3-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-3-297x210.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-3-1536x1086.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-3-120x85.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osmo-Action-5-Pro-action-camera-3-768x543.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The standard kit is $349 and includes the camera, one battery, magnetic mount, two-way mounting case, and a couple other small things.
