The Canyon/SRAM racing powerhouse has a resume stacked with 18 professional wins, including this year’s La Flèche Wallonne and Tour de France Femmes Avec Zwift. She also currently holds the title of UCI Gravel World Champion.

I find finals very interesting, and I can fully zone in and enjoy the whole process and the suffering part,” she said. “Gravel racing is also very interesting and stimulating in the way that you have to use your technical skills more often.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niewiadoma said she doesn’t necessarily look forward to the hard, steady paces associated with gravel races as much as the more explosive style of racing involving tactics that she prefers on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/pohlmann_photo_TDFFAZ_Niewiadoma_TPO_TDFFAZ_STG06_16082024_SL2_-24_V2-2100x1400-b0746ddd-8ac2-4d34-85b9-03c198402c1d-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2100\" height=\"1400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/pohlmann_photo_TDFFAZ_Niewiadoma_TPO_TDFFAZ_STG06_16082024_SL2_-24_V2-2100x1400-b0746ddd-8ac2-4d34-85b9-03c198402c1d-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Kasia Niewiadoma in the Yellow Jersey of the Tour De France Femme Avec Zwift.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/pohlmann_photo_TDFFAZ_Niewiadoma_TPO_TDFFAZ_STG06_16082024_SL2_-24_V2-2100x1400-b0746ddd-8ac2-4d34-85b9-03c198402c1d-jpg.webp 2100w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/pohlmann_photo_TDFFAZ_Niewiadoma_TPO_TDFFAZ_STG06_16082024_SL2_-24_V2-2100x1400-b0746ddd-8ac2-4d34-85b9-03c198402c1d-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/pohlmann_photo_TDFFAZ_Niewiadoma_TPO_TDFFAZ_STG06_16082024_SL2_-24_V2-2100x1400-b0746ddd-8ac2-4d34-85b9-03c198402c1d-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/pohlmann_photo_TDFFAZ_Niewiadoma_TPO_TDFFAZ_STG06_16082024_SL2_-24_V2-2100x1400-b0746ddd-8ac2-4d34-85b9-03c198402c1d-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/pohlmann_photo_TDFFAZ_Niewiadoma_TPO_TDFFAZ_STG06_16082024_SL2_-24_V2-2100x1400-b0746ddd-8ac2-4d34-85b9-03c198402c1d-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/pohlmann_photo_TDFFAZ_Niewiadoma_TPO_TDFFAZ_STG06_16082024_SL2_-24_V2-2100x1400-b0746ddd-8ac2-4d34-85b9-03c198402c1d-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/pohlmann_photo_TDFFAZ_Niewiadoma_TPO_TDFFAZ_STG06_16082024_SL2_-24_V2-2100x1400-b0746ddd-8ac2-4d34-85b9-03c198402c1d-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/pohlmann_photo_TDFFAZ_Niewiadoma_TPO_TDFFAZ_STG06_16082024_SL2_-24_V2-2100x1400-b0746ddd-8ac2-4d34-85b9-03c198402c1d-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Kasia Niewiadoma won the 2024 Tour de France Femme Avec Zwift while holding the title of UCI Gravel World Champion; (Photo/BOA)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“From the races I did, I definitely felt that (gravel) is super hard because you have a hard pace from the start, but it’s like this for the whole five-hour race, or six-hour race.

Throughout the season and even in the winter time preparing for the main season, I spend quite a lot of time on my gravel bike, or sometimes on my mountain bike, so I think I’m just used to changing surfaces. And I think that ultimately it all comes down to how comfortable you feel on the bike.” – Katarzyna ‘Kasia’ Niewiadoma. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Understanding BOA Technology</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>BOA Technology entered the cycling market 16 years ago. Its patented, award-winning BOA Fit System consists of micro-adjustable dials, strong, lightweight laces, and low-friction guides, replacing traditional laces in a sport that demands lightness, simplicity, toughness, and comfort in every piece of kit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the nagging issues that can come from traditional laces, the BOA Fit System allows its designers to reimagine the upper configuration in ways not possible with traditional laces. BOA says research conducted in its <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/boa-hq-tour-denver-colorado/\">BOA Performance Fit Lab</a> has shown many significant benefits of its PerformFit Wrap, where panels activated by the BOA Fit System wrap from medial to lateral for cyclists. These documented scientific benefits include up to a 9% increase in power output, 11% increase in peak power output during sprints, and 10% improvement in pressure distribution that benefits riders in sprints or long-distance riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Off-road shoes tend to be heavier than any other type of cycling shoe, as they require padding to absorb extreme punishment. Off-road riders also don’t generally have as much time, if any, to adjust their shoes while they charge down a mountain white-knuckling the bars, or cutting across a section of chunky gravel. But even the off-road world has snuggled up to BOA tech more and more as its benefits continue to become clearer, and models adapt to meet the demands of gravel, trail, and downhill riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>BOA platforms</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>BOA’s wrapped upper configurations, activated by the brand’s latest L-Series dials and purpose-fit for low-cut and light-weight footwear, continue to refine fit and performance on a whole new lineup of shoes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The L6 dial platform combines a lightweight design with a priority on durability. Like all modern BOA platforms, L6 features a breakaway design where the dial releases from the bayonet on extreme impact and pops back in without catastrophic damage. L6 also offers exceptional resistance to impact on the trail, dirt, and mud, with some brands opting for integrated shields so riders can have complete confidence on trails.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox_Union_Grey_Wrap-2100x1401-b6ba4abb-b950-4935-9e1e-bc43446c42d4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2100\" height=\"1401\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox_Union_Grey_Wrap-2100x1401-b6ba4abb-b950-4935-9e1e-bc43446c42d4.jpg\" alt=\"BOA dials on a mpuntain bike shoe.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox_Union_Grey_Wrap-2100x1401-b6ba4abb-b950-4935-9e1e-bc43446c42d4.jpg 2100w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox_Union_Grey_Wrap-2100x1401-b6ba4abb-b950-4935-9e1e-bc43446c42d4-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox_Union_Grey_Wrap-2100x1401-b6ba4abb-b950-4935-9e1e-bc43446c42d4-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox_Union_Grey_Wrap-2100x1401-b6ba4abb-b950-4935-9e1e-bc43446c42d4-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox_Union_Grey_Wrap-2100x1401-b6ba4abb-b950-4935-9e1e-bc43446c42d4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox_Union_Grey_Wrap-2100x1401-b6ba4abb-b950-4935-9e1e-bc43446c42d4-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox_Union_Grey_Wrap-2100x1401-b6ba4abb-b950-4935-9e1e-bc43446c42d4-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox_Union_Grey_Wrap-2100x1401-b6ba4abb-b950-4935-9e1e-bc43446c42d4-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>BOA dials are easy to operate, light, and tough; (Photo/BOA)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.boafit.com/en-us/innovation/dial-platforms/li2\" target=\"_blank\">Li2 platform, which is BOA’s most advanced</a>, provides a low-profile design with multidirectional adjustment capability and a fast total release tailored to riders who need extremely fine-tuned control that is effortless to use and unwaveringly reliable.
