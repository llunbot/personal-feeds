{"title":"Breathable, Garrett Murray’s AQI Widget for iOS and MacOS, Is Now Free of Charge","link":"https://breathable.app/","date":1736460349000,"content":"\n<p>I first linked to Breathable back in 2021 when Murray released the first version, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/21/breathable\">writing then</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The entire point of Breathable is to offer widgets — the app\nitself just lets you configure how the widgets look. Brilliantly\nsimple, and in a way, fun, with its clever “emoji scale”. I\nstarted using it last week after Murray pinged me about it, but\nonly because I was interested in the idea of a widget-only weather\napp — Philadelphia generally doesn’t have air quality issues. I\nshould have known better. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1417614057813725185\">Turns out</a>, the whole world now has air\nquality issues.</p>\n\n<p>Breathable costs just $2, and Murray is donating a portion of the\nproceeds to foundations focused on climate change initiatives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Breathable is now up to version 3.0, and is better than ever. Today, <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@garrettmurray/post/DEnU-sXvhPz\">Murray announced he’s make it free of charge</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In light of the awful fires and air quality in Los Angeles, I’ve\nmade Breathable free and app will remain free permanently. I\ncharged for the app prior only so I could donate the proceeds to\nclimate change charities, but paying Apple 15% for that privilege\nis silly.</p>\n\n<p>If you paid for the app in the past, thank you so much — your\nmoney was not wasted! It was donated to the Union of Concerned\nScientists, the Clean Air Task Force and the Climate Change\nEmergency Fund. I took great pride in donating to these terrific\ncauses in Breathable’s name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Good thoughts and best wishes to everyone in southern California <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/live/pacific-palisades-fire-updates-los-angeles\">facing this catastrophe</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/09/breathable-free\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9a324af5b5e5bd585224d67f827067133666282d71fb7f3752cfdad8e1954062","category":"Tech"}
