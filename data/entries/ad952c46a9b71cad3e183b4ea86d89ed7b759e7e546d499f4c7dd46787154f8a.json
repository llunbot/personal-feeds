But that release will apparently need to make use of a \"downgrader\" to work around a recent Bethesda \"next-gen\" update that upended all of the team's modding efforts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-london-mod-finally-gets-release-date-april/\">In December</a>, Team Folon announced that its work on the <em>Fallout: London</em> mod would culminate in a planned April 23 release, lining up with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George%27s_Day_in_England\">England's widely celebrated St. George's Day</a>. Then, just weeks before the planned launch, Bethesda <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1778444117770444973\">announced</a> that its own planned \"next-gen\" update for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/fallout-4-review-check-your-next-gen-expectations-at-the-vault-door/\">the 2015 game</a> would be coming out on April 25, two days after <em>Fallout: London</em>'s launch target.</p>\n<p>\"That has, for lack of a better term, screwed us over,\" Team Folon Project Manager Dean Carter <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L71cZvASvAE\">said in an interview with the BBC</a> shortly after Bethesda's upgrade announcement. In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpqMftkTteo\">a separate video</a>, Carter said that the next-gen update \"requires many of our internal systems to be updated,\" since the content they created in the <a href=\"https://f4se.silverlock.org/\"><em>Fallout 4</em> Script Extender</a> likely wouldn't work under the updated code. That turned out to be a valid concern, as the next-gen update <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/fallout-4s-next-gen-update-is-nearly-16-gigs-breaks-modded-saves-and-doesnt-seem-to-change-much-at-all/\">did end up breaking many <em>Fallout 4</em> mods and saves</a> after its release.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035720#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035720&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ad952c46a9b71cad3e183b4ea86d89ed7b759e7e546d499f4c7dd46787154f8a","category":"Tech"}
