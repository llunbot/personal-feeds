Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/q8gxit/notch_present_face_id_not_and_other_major_leaks/\">a Reddit user claimed</a> that the next MacBook Pro will not feature Face ID despite having a notch, with a Touch ID sensor expected to remain above the keyboard for authentication.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe photo is blurry and it's unclear if it's authentic, so some skepticism is warranted here. If the photo proves to be real, however, it suggests that the next MacBook Pro models could feature very thin bezels around the display.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the macOS Monterey beta, MacRumors <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/macbook-pro-2021-resolutions/\">discovered potential display resolutions</a> of 3024x1964 and 3456x2234 for the rumored 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models. When subtracting 74 pixels from the height of both, the resulting 3024x1890 and 3456x2160 resolutions work out to an aspect ratio of 16:10. All of Apple's current MacBooks feature a 16:10 aspect ratio, leading to speculation that the extra 74 pixels could be for a notch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/12/apple-event-unleashed-october-18/\">hosting a virtual event on Monday</a> at 10 a.m. Pacific Time, with rumors widely suggesting the event will be focused on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/14-inch-macbook-pro/\">redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models</a> with a faster version of the M1 chip and brighter mini-LED displays. The notebooks are also expected to feature an HDMI port, an SD card reader, and a magnetic power cable, while ditching the Touch Bar in favor of a return to physical Fn keys. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 16\"</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/16/macbook-pro-notch-alleged-photo/\">MacBook Pro Display With Notch Shown in Alleged Photo Leak</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-pro-display-with-notch-shown-in-alleged-photo-leak.2317250/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bFWpu8DMnAA:z-ZUHwU4CoU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bFWpu8DMnAA:z-ZUHwU4CoU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/bFWpu8DMnAA\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ed99c418b3eb4ac571fefc1d96412e2ff591515d3ae075235a3ab1fd37133964","category":"Apple"}
