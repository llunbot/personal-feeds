This year was busy and filled with a lot of slow-cooker meals, but I also learned that if I love cooking then I shouldn’t make it feel like a stressor on nights when time doesn’t allow. I recently bought a second slow-cooker and have been using it exclusively to make overnight steel-cut oatmeal. That and the jar of preserved lemons in-the-making in my fridge both feel like kitchen wins.</p>\n<p>Of my more nebulous aims “to keep writing and learning and moving,” I hope that <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/hailey-moore/\" target=\"_blank\">my work on this site</a> this year speaks to all three. For me, that’s a trio that feels intertwined and I hope it continues to be.</p>\n<p>As such, I’m happy to share that, among the editorial team, we’re expanding on the standard end-of-year “Favorite Products” approach and including a few creative recommendations as well as influential intangibles.

I have fond memories of it as a touring bike, but most recently I’ve been really loving the Bombora as a singlespeed-converted commuter with Simworks’ Getaround bars for around-town missions. The singlespeed conversion part was made possible by the Velo Orange Eccentric Bottom Bracket.</p>\n<p>The Bombora is designed around a 68-millimeter English (BSA) Threaded bottom bracket shell and, although there are a growing number of compatible EBBs for this frame spec, at $100 Velo Orange’s offering is still one of the most affordable out there.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Haileys-Crust-Bombora-1.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Haileys-Crust-Bombora-1.jpeg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Haileys-Crust-Bombora-1.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Haileys-Crust-Bombora-1.jpeg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Above two photos: Josh Weinberg</em></p>\n<p>The single-block CNC’d aluminum BB body features separate cups for compatibility with 68 mm or 73 mm bottom bracket shells, and Velo Orange includes several considered bits and bobs for maximum ease of use: spacers, a GXP shim, a wave washer for the arm spindle side, and a tool that doubles as a chain tensioner and lock-ring wrench.</p>\n<p>I found the installation pretty straightforward and, after nearly a year of weekly erranding use, the bottom bracket is just starting to creak. I’m taking that as a friendly reminder to put in some winter maintenance on my bikes this year while the weather biases me towards skiing over pedaling!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-12-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-12-2.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-12-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-12-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/power-comp-with-mimic/p/159199?color=239696-159199\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized Power Comp Saddle w/ MIMIC</a> $140</h3>\n<p>Saddle preference is highly individual. I’ve also learned that my preference varies depending on riding style and, by extension, terrain and position on the bike. Barring quick overnighters or cooler weather tours, I almost never wear a chamois for multi-day rides because: sponge funk (though, a modest pair of chamois-free cargo bibshorts are certainly on my <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/wish-list/\" target=\"_blank\">wishlist</a>). While touring, I also adjust my cockpit to create a more upright position on the bike, which in turn puts more weight on my sit bones. In this scenario, a well-seasoned Brooks B17 or WTB Volt are usually my go-to’s, but I’ve found that when riding in bibs on a bike that puts more equal distribution between my hands and rear—on gravel or road rides, or during races—the Power Comp with MIMIC women’s saddle from Specialized has become my new standard.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-10-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-10-2.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-10-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-10-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>MIMIC is an extension of Specialized’s Body Geometry design initiative. Translated from marketing speak, this means that Specialized uses lab protocols in some product development to measure things like pressure and temperature at contact points between the rider and the product (saddles, shoes, gloves, etc.). MIMIC is a <a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/power-saddle-mimic\" target=\"_blank\">women’s specific design solution</a> that Specialized created to address problems female riders experience on other saddles. Notably, Specialized found that saddles with complete cutouts were less forgiving on female anatomy, and MIMIC was engineered to imitate the pressure-relief of a cut-out design, while still providing some soft-tissue support. Additionally, the Power Comp with MIMIC saddle comes with a shorter nose and three width options (143 mm, 155 mm, and 168 mm), features also tailored more generally to female athletes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-09.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-09.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-09.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-09.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-11-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-11-2.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-11-2.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-11-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Riding the 200-mile distance at <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/dust-up-unbound-gravel-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">Unbound</a> is as good a test as any for a piece of equipment. I’m happy to report that I had no saddle issues while riding the Power Comp with MIMIC over the notorious Flint Hills parcours this year.

While I think the categorization is a little forced—in my mind, a road shoe is largely defined by the three-bolt cleat interface—I’ve been really impressed with the shoe for rides that oscillate between road and dirt.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Fizik-Tempo-Beat-review-11-copy.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Fizik-Tempo-Beat-review-11-copy.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Fizik-Tempo-Beat-review-11-copy.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Fizik-Tempo-Beat-review-11-copy.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Fizik-Tempo-Beat-review-07-copy.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Fizik-Tempo-Beat-review-07-copy.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Fizik-Tempo-Beat-review-07-copy.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Fizik-Tempo-Beat-review-07-copy.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>So much so that hopefully regular readers will forgive the repeat mention of it here. If the look of the Beat was responsible for initially catching my eye, it’s undeniably the fit that has made me a true fan. The Beat’s secure heel cup, tapered midfoot and roomy toebox combine for a fit, that for my foot (wide toe box and a high arch), has proven unparalleled. I’ll certainly be dipping deeper into the fizik line in search of a similar last with an outsole more suited to hike-a-biking in the future.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/fizik-tempo-beat-gravel-shoe-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Read my fizik Tempo Beat review.</a></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Veolcio-Luxe-bra-review-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Veolcio-Luxe-bra-review-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Veolcio-Luxe-bra-review-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Veolcio-Luxe-bra-review-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://velocio.cc/products/womens-luxe-bra?variant=40321453523017\" target=\"_blank\">Velocio LUXE Sports Bra</a> $69</h3>\n<p>I used to think that a damp sports bra was an inevitable, uncomfortable byproduct of riding bikes. On warm-weather tours, there’s a special kind of ick factor that accompanies pulling on a sports bra, still soggy with yesterday’s sweat, at the start of the day (lay a moist washcloth across your bare chest tomorrow morning before dressing and you’ll get the idea). On day rides during <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/riding-bikes-in-the-winter/\" target=\"_blank\">colder months</a>, that extra moisture can lead to a quick chill while descending, or during a prolonged stop, that’s hard to shake even with extra layers. But, while covering the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/komoot-slovenia-womens-rally/\" target=\"_blank\">Komoot Slovenia Women’s rally</a> in 2023, a fellow rider made the bold statement that Velocio’s LUXE bra “doesn’t get wet.” I had to put her claim to the test.</p>\n<p>After riding in the LUXE regularly this year, I can confirm that it is unlike any other sports bra I’ve worn. The LUXE is positioned as cycling-specific and the design reflects the sport’s low-impact nature. Unlike the dual-layer construction that I’ve typically seen among sports bras designed for a range of activities, the LUXE is cut from a single layer of the same signature fabric that gives name to one of Velocio’s line of bibshorts.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Veolcio-Luxe-bra-review-3.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Veolcio-Luxe-bra-review-3.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Veolcio-Luxe-bra-review-3.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Veolcio-Luxe-bra-review-3.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Veolcio-Luxe-bra-review-2.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Veolcio-Luxe-bra-review-2.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Veolcio-Luxe-bra-review-2.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Veolcio-Luxe-bra-review-2.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Veolcio-Luxe-bra-review-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Veolcio-Luxe-bra-review-4.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Veolcio-Luxe-bra-review-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Veolcio-Luxe-bra-review-4.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The minimal design and thin fabric do make it nearly impossible for the bra to absorb moisture, but the tradeoff is less support (I did not find this to be an issue on the bike, though I can’t recommend the LUXE for running). Velocio seeks to remedy the less supportive paneling by incorporating a<em> very </em>compressive bottom band that fits snugly around the ribs and wide microfiber shoulder straps.</p>\n<p>To adjust for the highly compressive fit, Velocio recommends sizing up from one’s usual size (their size range for the LUXE extends from XXS to 3XL), which I ultimately did after ordering two sizes to see which fit best. Still, the fit does take some getting used to: for me, the LUXE always feels a bit restrictive at first, but then I soon forget about it while riding. However, like a helmet, it’s always a good feeling to take it off after a long day out. Even so, the ultra-wicking nature of the LUXE has made it a welcome addition to my cycling kit and, going into winter, I look forward to skiing in it too.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-06.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-06.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-06.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-06.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.skratchlabs.com/products/energy-chews-sport-fuel?variant=12067625238599\" target=\"_blank\">Skratch Labs Energy Chews Lemon + Green Tea Flavor</a> $23.95 (10-pack of pouches)</h3>\n<p>I got to try a variety of Skratch Labs products earlier this year after interviewing the brand’s dietician for my piece about <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/gas-station-fueling-tips-for-cyclists/\" target=\"_blank\">gas station fueling tips</a> for bikepacking and long-distance rides. The Lemon + Green Tea Flavor chews have since become a favorite for big days on the bike, long runs, and even ski tours.</p>\n<p>Even though each individual package boasts the label “Sport Fuel,” and the blurb on the back points to two types of simple carbs for speedier absorption, let’s be clear on the fact that these energy chews are fancy candy.

Each little gummy has the perfect amount of soft chewiness, without getting stuck in your teeth until your next dentist visit (looking at you Clif Blocks), and the addition of the green tea flavor takes the edge off the sweetness just enough so I don’t get tired of the taste.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-3.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.brooksengland.com/en_us/pickwick-cotton-canvas.html\" target=\"_blank\">Brooks England Pickwick Cotton Canvas Backpack</a> $220</h3>\n<p>There is a very real chance that my current Brooks B17 saddle will outlast my life as a cyclist. The enduring elegance of Brooks England’s leather saddles has come to define the brand, and I see the same commitment to timeless design and quality construction in my Brooks Pickwick Backpack.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-7.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-7.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-6.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-6.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Pickwick uses a simple roll-top design, is available in two sizes (26 or 12 L) and comes in two materials, leather or cotton canvas. I’ve had my 26-liter cotton canvas Pickwick (color: Goosebeak) for a few years now and it’s served me as both a daily carry pack for commuting to coffee shops, and as a carry-on bag on numerous trips.</p>\n<p>When fully expanded, the 26 L holds about as much as I’d ever want to carry on my back, though more often my load is smaller and I appreciate how a few folds of the top cinches down the volume. Snap closures on either side of the bag’s opening keep the folds tidy. Inside, the Pickwick features a sewn-in laptop sleeve, two pouch pockets and one zippered pocket to keep contents organized. There’s an additional stealth zippered pocket beneath the cotton backpack straps on the outside of the Pickwick—when traveling, I like to stash my wallet and passport here after I’ve gone through airport security.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-4.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-4.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-8.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-8.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-8.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-8.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-5.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-5.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-5.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Brooks-England-Pickwick-5.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The exterior of the Pickwick is wax-treated, making the canvas weather-resistant. Brooks recommends any rub-on fabric wax to re-weatherize the canvas. Other than a few simple leather accents and the aluminum hooks used to secure the roll-top and chest strap, that’s really all there is to the Pickwick. It’s an unfussy sturdy backpack that I’ll likely hold onto for the rest of my life. And, like my B17 that’s just starting to patina, the Pickwick will only become more beautiful with age.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-01.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-01.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.topeak.com/us/en/product/1322-JOEBLOW-BOOSTER\" target=\"_blank\">Topeak JoeBlow Booster Floor Pump</a> $219.95</h3>\n<p>Forget the white-picket fence, golden retriever, and 2.2 kids, my American dream starts and ends with owning a house with a garage. A one-car garage would be fine and I wouldn’t even want to put my car in it, just bikes. And, maybe an air compressor.</p>\n<p>I recently moved rental houses for the seventh time in the eight years that I’ve lived in Colorado. And while this latest move has certainly been an upgrade (no more stairs involved in bike storage!), my garage and air compressor-dreams are still very much on hold. Luckily, the Topeak JoeBlow Booster is a floor pump that’s much easier to move than an air compressor, yet it’s been impressively serviceable for the task of mounting tubeless tires.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-02.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-02.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Along with standard floor-pump functionality, the JoeBlow Booster features a one-liter aluminum chamber that can be “charged,” or filled, with up to 160 psi (11 bar) of air pressure. To fill the chamber, you simply switch the dial on the outside of the pressure gauge from “inflate” to “charge” and pump away until the needle maxes out at 160.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve seated a tubeless-ready tire on the rim, attach the Booster’s chuck to the valve and turn the dial back to the “inflate” position. Air stored in the compressor chamber is then released all at once and hopefully you’re rewarded with the satisfying series of pops that indicate the tire is successfully set. I find that applying a little pressure to the top of the tire with my hand after releasing the charge helps.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-03.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-03.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-04.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-04.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Most of the time, the JoeBlow Booster gets the job done, if not on the first charge then on the second. There have been a few instances with more finicky rims where, after three laborious charges, the tire still doesn’t set up and I want to shake my fist in the air in frustration, but I don’t because my arms are too tired from all that pumping. But, again, <em>most</em> of the time I have faith that the Booster will do the trick, because historically it has. Moving houses is a chance to take inventory and audit your personal possessions. Thus far, Topeak’s JoeBlow Booster has made the cut three times. If I didn’t think it was worth it, I wouldn’t keep carting it around.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/DSC05076-copy.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/DSC05076-copy.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/DSC05076-copy.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/DSC05076-copy.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Favorite Ride: Mount Mitchell in North Carolina (May 2024)</h3>\n<p>Going into 2024, I was all but certain that I would be writing about the riding in my home state of North Carolina in a different context. As part of a collaboration with a couple local western North Carolina organizations based in the town of Old Fort, my partner, Tony, and I were deep in the planning process at the start of the year for a non-competitive, unsupported bikepacking rally, slated for spring 2025. We hoped to showcase the ample riding potential in the Blue Ridge Mountains by creating a ~300-mile and a ~150-mile route, both of which would be organized around geographic highlights: the Linville Gorge and Mount Mitchell. Hurricane Helene, the thousand-year storm that flooded western NC’s many rivers and gutted any infrastructure in its path in late September, has, of course, firmly tabled those plans.</p>\n<p>In light of the storm, I look back on a ride to the summit of Mt. Mitchell that Tony and I did together in May of this year as more precious than it felt on the day, although I thoroughly enjoyed it then. Topping out at 6,684′, the summit of Mount Mitchell (Attakulla among the Cherokee) is the highest point east of the Mississippi River and I take pride in its poetic prominence. Before traveling east this spring, I’d ridden to its summit once before. Starting at lower lying locales around Asheville, and given the wrinkled topography of the region’s ancient hills, a trip to the summit clocks up significant elevation.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/DSC02983.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/DSC02983.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/DSC02983.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/DSC02983.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-9.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-9.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/DSC05212.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/DSC05212.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/DSC05212.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/DSC05212.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>In the Blue Ridge</em></p>\n<p>We started the day by riding a new-to-us stretch of the Blue Ridge Parkway, from the Asheville side, to reach the turn-off for Mitchell. What began as a public works project under the FDR administration in 1933, the Blue Ridge Parkway (BRP) is now a 469-mile paved scenic road, and national park, that stretches from Shenandoah National Park in western Virginia, across western North Carolina, and ends at the Great Smokey Mountains National Park near the North Carolina and Tennessee border. The BRP follows the spine of the ever-undulating enchainment of the Appalachian Mountains so you can rest assured that you will face significant climbing in either direction you follow it.</p>\n<p>Often shrouded in clouds, the summit of Mitchell was vaulted by bluebird skies. After a quick stop at the snack stand, we enjoyed the serpentine descent back to the BRP and then steeled ourselves for a few more mixed surface climbs (some necessary for the return, some elective). It’s never as straightforward as up or down in western NC. We <a href=\"https://ridewithgps.com/trips/194194737\" target=\"_blank\">ended the day</a> with a little over 100 miles and 10k’ of climbing in our legs—I like round numbers. At the time, I’d planned this as my last long ride before lining up at Unbound a couple weeks later; I didn’t anticipate that it would be the last time I’d ride some of these roads as I’d grown to know them.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Third_Plate_Dan_Barber_book.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Third_Plate_Dan_Barber_book.jpeg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Third_Plate_Dan_Barber_book.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Third_Plate_Dan_Barber_book.jpeg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Favorite Book (Read in 2024)</h3>\n<p>Although far from new, <em>The Third Plate</em> is the work of non-fiction that I have read and enjoyed most in recent memory. Through his reflective, and often humorous, first-person telling, chef and restauranteur Dan Barber examines the effectiveness of the farm-to-table movement in the US in four themed episodes, with entertaining characters at the center of each: Soil, Land, Sea, and Seed. His assessment? That the farm-to-table movement has not been enough to change how Americans eat and, in turn, make a positive impact on the (degrading) environment. His recommendation involves deep scrutiny of American cuisine and challenges modern conceptions of grocery store-aisle entitlement: for a so-called farm-to-table movement to be successful in creating a truly regenerative agricultural model, Barber makes the case that the farm—and therefore the <em>land</em>—must actually dictate what is most sustainable to produce.</p>\n<p>I’ve been loosely following Barber’s two Blue Hill restaurants and the non-profit agricultural research campus on which one sits, Stone Barns, since being featured in the Netflix series <em>Chef’s Table</em>. After reading Barber’s book this past winter, and when some semi-proximal travel plans aligned this summer, I got to take a trip to Blue Hill at Stone Barns in September.

A few of the artists I follow put out new work, and while I definitely enjoyed some select tracks, nothing really grabbed me in a lasting way. (On that note, maybe a new year’s goal for 2025 should be to expand my listening more!) So, while I think the question of “favorite album of all time” is bascially impossible to answer, a previously released favorite that I returned to again and again in 2024—confirmed by my Spotify Wrapped—was Protomartyr’s <em>Relatives in Descent</em> from 2017.</p>\n<p>Most of <em>Relatives in Descent</em> was written by the Detroit group following the 2016 election. Maybe the parallel nature of these times is part of why I’ve been returning to its tension-driven, dark allusions. But, to be honest, since getting into the band about four years ago, I haven’t really <em>stopped</em> listening to them on a regular basis.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/IMG_0145-Small.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/IMG_0145-Small.jpeg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/IMG_0145-Small.jpeg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/IMG_0145-Small.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/IMG_0143-Small.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/IMG_0143-Small.jpeg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/IMG_0143-Small.jpeg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/IMG_0143-Small.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Protomartyr at the Hi-Dive in Denver; March 2023</em></p>\n<p>For me, frontman and (primary) lyricist Joe Casey’s gruff, often deadpan, spoken-word deliveries contain a captivating kind of disaffection. Similar to Andrew Savage’s vocals and the literary nature of another favorite, Parquet Courts, Casey’s words regularly strike a compelling balance between the literal and the figurative. The album also has a sense of self-contained completeness, bookended by “A Private Understanding” and the closer, “Half Sister” which rephrases themes from the opening track.</p>\n<p>Although there are many standout moments between the first and last songs—the jazzy romp of “Here Is The Thing”, the elegaic epic “My Children”, and the unsettling refutation of “Windsor Hum” as just three examples—the five-plus minute “A Private Understanding” is among my favorite expressions of the band, regardless of album. From the opening, disjointed drum rolls, simple strummed chord progressions, to the build-up and release, this—for me—is Protomartyr at their best.  And, with lyrics like these, I wish Joe Casey would take up the pen for fiction:</p>\n<p><em>People live with a private understanding</em><br />\n<em>Sorrow’s the wind blowing through</em><br />\n<em>Truth is hiding in the wire</em></p>\n<p><em>Elvis outside of Flagstaff</em><br />\n<em>Driving a camper van</em><br />\n<em>Looking for meaning in a cloud mass</em><br />\n<em>Sees the face of Joseph Stalin</em><br />\n<em>And is disheartened</em><br />\n<em>Then the wind changed the cloud into his smiling Lord</em><br />\n<em>And he was affected profoundly</em><br />\n<em>But he could never describe the feeling</em><br />\n<em>He passed away on the bathroom floor.</em></p>\n<p>Protomartyr doesn’t exactly make what I’d call accessible music, but that’s why I like it. The riffs are catchy, but the words academic—it’s a combination that means there’s always something else to find when you come back to it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/San_Juan_trip_2024-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/San_Juan_trip_2024-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/San_Juan_trip_2024-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/San_Juan_trip_2024-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Stopping early for the night on a solo tour in the San Juans; August 2024</em></p>\n<h3>Lesson Learned</h3>\n<p>In late March, after a comically bad day that included—in unrelated events—spraining my ankle while skiing and throwing up in a Jiffy Lube lobby, I found myself having a little pity party. The ankle sprain meant that I’d have to postpone a long-run goal that I’d been hoping to see through in North Carolina that spring, and whatever stomach bug had taken hold was just making me feel miserable. My entire trip to North Carolina was now postponed and I had no idea when I’d get back there (of course, at that point, I also had no notion that a hurricane could possibly decimate vast swathes of the western NC region).</p>\n<p>Injuries always prompt me to reflect on the physical pursuits that I enjoy—cycling, running, and climbing, primarily—and the importance that I attach to specific outdoor goals in each. On my lowest days, I have the sinking feeling that I’ll never get to see through half of the things I’d like to do. And this was a low day.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-20.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-20.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-17.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-17.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Untitled-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>A ride up Mount Blue Sky; June 2024</em></p>\n<p>Laid up on the couch, puke bucket within reach and an ice compress on my ankle, it hit me that among my list of things that I’d like to do were things that I had already done and thought I should go back and do <em>better</em>. In that moment, the notion of having the luxury of time to <em>repeat</em> something when there were so many as-yet unfulfilled first-time bucket-list items struck me as ludicrously naive. I realized I’d been harboring a “next-time” mindset as a carryover from the seemingly limitless amount of life runway that I’d perceived to have in my 20s.</p>\n<p>Going forward, I know that I might not get to everything on my list: like my little pile of things to fix, each list gets longer the more you live. But, I do hope I can hold onto the realization that we don’t often get do-overs for the really big things.
