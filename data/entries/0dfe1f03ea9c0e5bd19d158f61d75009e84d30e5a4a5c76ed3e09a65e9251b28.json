The first <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-specialized-turbo-vado-sl-is-the-commuter-e-bike-for-cyclists-and-urbanites/\">Specialized Vado SL</a> was practical with an additional lux factor, shaving weight, and adding some premium features that most cyclists would appreciate. Rounding out the package, the Specialized Vado SL has a unique look that stands out in the rack. The new version of the Vado SL doubles down on sports car looks, now offering a stand alone super-commuter option. Meet the new Specialized Vado SL 2 Carbon.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-in-the-dark-.jpeg\"><img width=\"12085\" height=\"6798\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-in-the-dark-.jpeg\" alt=\"Bike in the dark with head light \" /></a><figcaption>(Images: Specialized)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now on its second iteration, the updated Specialized Vado SL 2 is about performance, speed, and style.

Specialized Vado SL 2 </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized sees the new Vado SL 2 as a sports car compared to other e-bikes in the same space. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Why a sports car?</em> Specialized is well known for taking something practical and walking the thin line between luxury and over the top. The Vado SL 2 hops from too much to just right. This is the feeling that Specialized looked to cultivate: fun, fast, and exciting.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-LTD-Details--jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"9193\" height=\"5171\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-LTD-Details--jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Vado battery and motor \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-LTD-Details--jpeg.webp 9193w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-LTD-Details--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-LTD-Details--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-LTD-Details--120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-LTD-Details--768x432.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s Under the Hood? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Specialized Vado SL 2 boasts some serious power and range. The Turbo SL 1.2 motor can accelerate with up to 320 watts of power, granting standstill to top speed in seconds (very helpful when lights go from red to green). </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Assist: Up to 28mph</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Battery: 520Wh with up to 5 hours of ride time</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Torque: 50Nm</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-App--jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"8192\" height=\"4608\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-App--jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Specialized App and modes \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-App--jpeg.webp 8192w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-App--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-App--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-App--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-App--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-App--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Personalized Ride</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like others in the Specialized e-bike universe, the all-new Vado SL2 offers a customized ride experience. Download the Specialized App, and you can customize your ride. You can also keep track of everything you would have on your head unit, including heart rate, power, and cadence. Plus, you can maximize mode efficiency and top out wattage, ensuring you can get the most out of the 520Wh battery. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-Bakc-LTD--jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"9339\" height=\"5253\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-Bakc-LTD--jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Vado 2 with carbon seat post \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-Bakc-LTD--jpeg.webp 9339w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-Bakc-LTD--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-Bakc-LTD--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-Bakc-LTD--120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-Bakc-LTD--768x432.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Confident Handling and Smart Features</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vado SL 2 uses the Specialized Future Shock 3.2 with 20mm travel. This additional bump control should give riders confidence on pothole-littered city streets and drop off the occasional curb. Specialized also upped the tire volume to 47C tires to give a smooth and more capable ride, no matter the terrain. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Vado_SL2_Long_Exposure-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"8192\" height=\"4608\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Vado_SL2_Long_Exposure-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"In front of the cafe \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Vado_SL2_Long_Exposure-jpeg.webp 8192w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Vado_SL2_Long_Exposure-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Vado_SL2_Long_Exposure-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Vado_SL2_Long_Exposure-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Vado_SL2_Long_Exposure-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Vado_SL2_Long_Exposure-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Find My App Integration and Anti-Theft </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new SL Carbon 2 employs “Find My” App Integration, with built-in anti-theft technology that syncs with your iPhone and alerts you where your bike is. You can also lock it and set the alarm off when needed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>What if I need to fix something on the Specialized Vado SL 2 Carbon? </em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s say,<em> “You’ll know.” </em>Specialized has a new service and maintenance program. The onboard computer notifies you and your dealer when the bike needs maintenance. All service logs are now integrated into the Specialized App, so you’ll know what was serviced and when. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-in-use--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-in-use--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Rider coming from the bottom of the frame \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-in-use--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-in-use--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-in-use--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-in-use--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-in-use--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-in-use--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-in-use--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Specialized Vado SL 2 Carbon Models </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Specialized Vado Sl 2 is available in three different models and personalities. All models come with a carbon frame and seatpost, and the same goes for the intervals. Each uses the Turbo SL 1.2 motor with a Mastermind H3 for ride information and bike control. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-LTD-Dark--jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"9504\" height=\"5346\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-LTD-Dark--jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Vado SL 2 Carbon LTD Dark\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-LTD-Dark--jpeg.webp 9504w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-LTD-Dark--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-LTD-Dark--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-LTD-Dark--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-LTD-Dark--768x432.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vado SL Carbon 2 6.0 LTD</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the showroom piece, the 250-limited 50th Anniversary Edition Specialized LTD version of the Vado. It arrives with SRAM Force AXS shifting, SRAM Level brakes, and carbon bars. Specialized didn’t go overboard to overshadow the Vado’s utility, but they cut some grams where possible. The additional <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/specialized-celebrates-50-years-imited-s-works-forward-50-collection/\">LTD 50th Anniversary paint job </a>is enough to drool over. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-EQ-side--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-EQ-side--1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Black version of the Vado 2 \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-EQ-side--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-EQ-side--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-EQ-side--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-EQ-side--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-EQ-side--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-EQ-side--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-EQ-back--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-EQ-back--1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Red version of the Vado 2 \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-EQ-back--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-EQ-back--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-EQ-back--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-EQ-back--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-EQ-back--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-EQ-back--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vado SL Carbon 2 6.0 EQ</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This model of the Vado SL 2 is the EQ (equipped) version and is the Vado in its most capable build. The build is slightly stout compared to the LTD version, using Shimano XT shifting and alloy bars. But it can also carry much more, with an easy-on/off rack, fenders, and other commuting gear.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-6.0-side--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-6.0-side--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Vado 2 SL bare \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-6.0-side--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-6.0-side--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-6.0-side--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-6.0-side--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-6.0-side--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-6.0-side--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Vado-SL-2-Carbon-6.0-side--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vado SL Carbon 2 6.0</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the base model, the “original” Vado idea.
