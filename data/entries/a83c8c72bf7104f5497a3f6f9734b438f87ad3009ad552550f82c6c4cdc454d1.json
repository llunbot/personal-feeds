The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGI8sZqWEl0&amp;t=553s\">end of the video</a> also revealed a new feature that is supposedly planned for the iPhone 17 Pro models later this year: dual video recording.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iPhone-17-Pro-3_4ths-Perspective-Aluminum-Camera-Module-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nAccording to Front Page Tech host Jon Prosser, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will allow users to record video with the front and rear cameras simultaneously. This is a capability that is already available through select apps on the App Store, such as Snapchat, but it would now be available through the built-in Camera app. Samsung introduced a built-in dual video recording feature on the Galaxy S21 and newer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDual video recording in the Camera app would be useful for content creators on platforms like YouTube and TikTok, allowing them to easily overlay a shot of their face over a world-facing video, so that viewers can watch them speak and react.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSkip to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGI8sZqWEl0&amp;t=553s\">9:13 mark of Front Page Tech's video</a> to hear about this particular rumor.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple should release all of the iPhone 17 models in September. It is unclear why this seemingly basic feature will allegedly require an iPhone 17 Pro model.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/iphone-17-pro-dual-video-recording-rumor/\">iPhone 17 Pro Models Rumored to Offer Dual Video Recording Feature in Camera App</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-models-rumored-to-offer-dual-video-recording-feature-in-camera-app.2454941/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a83c8c72bf7104f5497a3f6f9734b438f87ad3009ad552550f82c6c4cdc454d1","category":"Apple"}
