The carnivorous <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/meet-the-real-zombifying-fungus-behind-the-fictional-last-of-us-outbreak/\">fungus</a> <i>Arthrobotrys oligospora</i> doesn’t seem like much while it’s eating away at rotting wood. But when it senses a live worm, it will trap its victim and consume it alive—pure nightmare fuel.</p>\n<p>Until now, not much was known about how the attack of the killer fungus happens on a molecular level. Researchers from Academia Sinica in Taiwan have finally found out how the gene activity of the fungus changes when a nematode creeps too close to <i>A. oligospora. </i>Led by molecular biologist Hung-Che Lin, the research team discovered that the fungus synthesizes a sort of worm adhesive and additional trapping proteins to get ahold of its meal. It then produces enzymes that break down the worm so it can start feasting.</p>\n<h2>Caught in a trap</h2>\n<p><em>A.</em> <i>oligospora </i>lives in the soil and is mostly <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2011/05/a-new-branch-found-in-the-fungal-tree-of-life/\">saprotrophic</a>, meaning it feeds on decaying organic matter. But that can quickly change if it finds itself deprived of nutrients or senses a tempting nematode nearby. This is when it goes into carnivore mode.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991782#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991782&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ca6448a5cdcdec8ff3a5351032292a88265e5eb294ab48cb7d3f1df79e7e8856","category":"Tech"}
