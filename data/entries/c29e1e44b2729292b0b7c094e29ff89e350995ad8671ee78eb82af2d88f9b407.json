Vanta lets you shortcut compliance — without shortchanging security.</p>\n\n<p>Vanta brings GRC and security efforts together. Integrate information from multiple systems and reduce risks to your business, all without the need for additional staffing. And because Vanta automates up to 90 percent of the work for SOC 2, ISO 27001, and more, you’ll be able to focus on strategy and security, not maintaining compliance.</p>\n\n<p>From the most in-demand frameworks to third-party risk management and security questionnaires, Vanta gives SaaS businesses of all sizes one place to manage risk and prove security in real time. </p>\n\n<p>Try Vanta free for 7 days. No costs or obligations.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/19/vanta\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c29e1e44b2729292b0b7c094e29ff89e350995ad8671ee78eb82af2d88f9b407","category":"Tech"}
