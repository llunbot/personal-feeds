These resilient survivors have outlasted dinosaurs and <a href=\"https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1440-1703.12442\">multiple mass extinctions</a>.

Woodii</em> was discovered in 1895 by the botanist John Medley Wood while he was on a botanical expedition in the Ngoye Forest in South Africa. He searched the vicinity for others, but <a href=\"https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/43451#page/263/mode/1up\">none could be found</a>.
