Even if you’re only in a shop for 30 seconds, securing your bike somewhere, somehow, is critical when it comes to preventing bike theft.</p><p>For those riding in the city and leaving bikes out for hours at a time, a bigger, stronger lock becomes a necessity. For those just popping into a rural general store mid-gravel century, a tiny lock that can slide into a jersey pocket and only add a few ounces of weight might be plenty. Whatever your riding style, we have you covered with our best bike lock picks, from the burliest to the lightest options.</p><p>Here are our top picks in three categories – Chain locks, U-Locks, and Quick locks- but keep reading all the way down to see how they’re rated, how to file an insurance claim if your bike does get stolen while locked up, and other frequently asked questions…</p><h3><span><strong>&nbsp;BEST CHAIN LOCK</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001SMSUNI/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kryptonite New York Cinch Ring Chain 1275&nbsp;</a></span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110719/Kryptonite-New-York-Cinch-Ring-Chain-1275.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110719/Kryptonite-New-York-Cinch-Ring-Chain-1275.jpg\" alt=\"Kryptonite New York Cinch Ring Chain 1275\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1047\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110719/Kryptonite-New-York-Cinch-Ring-Chain-1275.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110719/Kryptonite-New-York-Cinch-Ring-Chain-1275-297x194.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110719/Kryptonite-New-York-Cinch-Ring-Chain-1275-800x524.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110719/Kryptonite-New-York-Cinch-Ring-Chain-1275-120x79.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110719/Kryptonite-New-York-Cinch-Ring-Chain-1275-768x503.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110719/Kryptonite-New-York-Cinch-Ring-Chain-1275-1536x1005.jpg 1536w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110719/Kryptonite-New-York-Cinch-Ring-Chain-1275-696x455.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110719/Kryptonite-New-York-Cinch-Ring-Chain-1275-1068x699.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110719/Kryptonite-New-York-Cinch-Ring-Chain-1275-642x420.jpg 642w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110719/Kryptonite-New-York-Cinch-Ring-Chain-1275-741x486.jpg 741w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>There’s a reason the ubiquitous image of a bike messenger always includes three key things: A fixed gear bike, a single-strap messenger bag slung over a shoulder, and a hefty chain belt with a canvas cover looped around the rider’s waist.

They offer several versions of the belt-style lock, but the Gold-rated model is the best and strongest.</p><p>We’ll get to why we like this but have to admit, it’s not perfect. At a measured useable length of 31″ (claimed is 33.4″), it’s <em>just</em> long enough to get around a front wheel, downtube, and bike rack. And the seatbelt-like strap that makes it wearable tends to get in the way of connecting the links to the lock. But neither are deal-breakers, and it has some other great features to make up for it.</p><p>Unlike the others that you <em>could</em> wear around your waist, this one is actually comfortable to wear. The protective sleeve wraps 10mm links and not only prevents scratches, it’s also reflective to keep you safer in low light. And it comes with <em>three</em> keys where most locks only have two. The adjustable strap fits waists from 30″ to 44″.</p><ul><li>Type: Chain</li><li>Material: Steel</li><li>Sold Secure Rating: Gold</li><li>Chain Length: 31″</li><li>Weight: 4.85 pounds</li><li>MSRP: $129.99</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Strong, easy (and comfortable) to carry, reflective sleeve adds safety<br><strong>CONS</strong>: A little finicky to maneuver into locking position, just barely long enough<br></p><h3><span><strong>&nbsp;BEST LIGHTWEIGHT CHAIN LOCK:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0063W5SZG/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Abus Ivera Chain 7210&nbsp;</a></span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29165927/abus-ivera-7210-bike-chain-lock-review.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29165927/abus-ivera-7210-bike-chain-lock-review.jpg\" alt=\"abus ivera 7210 bicycle chain lock with soft cover\" width=\"1084\" height=\"775\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29165927/abus-ivera-7210-bike-chain-lock-review.jpg 1084w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29165927/abus-ivera-7210-bike-chain-lock-review-297x212.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29165927/abus-ivera-7210-bike-chain-lock-review-800x572.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29165927/abus-ivera-7210-bike-chain-lock-review-120x86.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29165927/abus-ivera-7210-bike-chain-lock-review-768x549.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29165927/abus-ivera-7210-bike-chain-lock-review-696x498.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29165927/abus-ivera-7210-bike-chain-lock-review-1068x764.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29165927/abus-ivera-7210-bike-chain-lock-review-587x420.jpg 587w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29165927/abus-ivera-7210-bike-chain-lock-review-100x70.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1084px) 100vw, 1084px\"></a></p><p>First off, good luck navigating Abus’ website and finding the exact chain lock you want…it’s a maze, and lacks good info. But we’ve tried this one and the heavier duty <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C8YR3VQ/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">8210</a> (which is Sold Secure Silver rated) chain locks and they’re both awesome…so just use these links to find them.</p><p>Both use a synthetic knit cover to protect your bike from the steel chain, and both can easily sling over your shoulder to wear like a bandolier. But this slightly smaller <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0063W5SZG/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Abus Ivera 7210</a> has two advantages. First, it weighs 500g less, so it’s much more comfortable to wear or carry.</p><p>Second, it locks without requiring the key, just snap the end into the head and it’s locked. Bonus points are that it also comes in several colors. At 38″ long, it’s a bit shorter than the 46″ 8210, so just pick the one that gives you the length or security you need.</p><ul><li>Type: Chain</li><li>Material: Hardened Steel</li><li>Sold Secure Rating: Not Rated</li><li>Chain Length: 38″</li><li>Weight: 2.875 pounds</li><li>MSRP: $69.99</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Longer and slinkier than the rest makes it easy to use, lightweight<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Not Gold rated, so best for lower-risk areas, unfortunate website navigation<br></p><h2>Best Bike U-Locks</h2><h3><span>&nbsp;<strong>BEST U-LOCK</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F115950%2Fabus-granit-x-plus-540-u-lock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Abus Granit XPlus 540 U-Lock&nbsp;</a></span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110702/Abus-Granit-XPlus-540-U-Lock.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110702/Abus-Granit-XPlus-540-U-Lock.jpg\" alt=\"Abus Granit XPlus 540 U-Lock\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1047\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110702/Abus-Granit-XPlus-540-U-Lock.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110702/Abus-Granit-XPlus-540-U-Lock-297x194.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110702/Abus-Granit-XPlus-540-U-Lock-800x524.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110702/Abus-Granit-XPlus-540-U-Lock-120x79.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110702/Abus-Granit-XPlus-540-U-Lock-768x503.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110702/Abus-Granit-XPlus-540-U-Lock-1536x1005.jpg 1536w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110702/Abus-Granit-XPlus-540-U-Lock-696x455.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110702/Abus-Granit-XPlus-540-U-Lock-1068x699.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110702/Abus-Granit-XPlus-540-U-Lock-642x420.jpg 642w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27110702/Abus-Granit-XPlus-540-U-Lock-741x486.jpg 741w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The Abus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F115950%2Fabus-granit-x-plus-540-u-lock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Granit XPlus 540 U-Lock</a>&nbsp;gets their&nbsp;15-out-of-15 security rating, making it perfect anywhere a standard U-shaped bike lock will work.

The $10 (or $5) ones from big box department stores are fairly easy to cut through for a bike thief, so if you’re trying to protect your investment (read: expensive bike), it’s worth shelling out more for a quality lock. Here’s what to consider before randomly buying the first bike lock that pops up on Amazon:</p><p><strong>How long you’re locking it and where</strong>. Context matters! For instance, one rider explained that living and riding in downtown Toronto, where bike theft was rampant, he swore by a burly Kryptonite lock. But now, living in Munich where there are thousands of bikes locked outside at all times, he feels comfortable using a lighter, smaller cable lock. And of course, if you’re leaving&nbsp; a bike outside overnight regularly versus just occasionally dashing into the grocery store to pick up a couple things on your ride home, you’ll want something more heavy-duty.</p><p><strong>How you’re carrying it</strong>. Are you looking for a lock that will fit in a jersey pocket with all of your other riding stuff? If that’s the case, you’re going to want something small and compact like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F144709%2Fhiplok-z-lok-combo-lock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hiplock Z Lok Combo</a>. But if you’re bringing a backpack to the office and can stash your seven pound Kryptonite chain lock in there, you’re not going to need to stress about size or weight.</p><p><strong>What you’re locking to.</strong> While U-locks are the classic bike lock, they really only work in very specific situations. You need a skinny pole or a bike rack to lock them to, and even then, you may struggle to get your front wheel and frame locked together. (The same is true of the small Hiplock.) A chain or cable lock can be used around most things, from a trees to telephone poles.</p><p><strong>How often you’ll use it.</strong> If it’s going to be a daily use lock, or you’ll be unlocking and re-locking often, look for a lock that has a particularly easy-to-use key or combination.</p><h4>You’ll also want to consider these factors in a lock:</h4><p><strong>Is it a combination or a key lock?</strong> If it’s a key, make sure you get multiple keys with it, then store one of the extras somewhere safe. For combinations, make sure you’re good at remembering your combo! (Pro tip: Create a contact in your phone’s address book for the lock and note the combo there)</p><p><strong>Is it going to scratch your bike?</strong> Avoid chains that aren’t covered: Brands like Kryptonite and Abus use heavy canvas or synthetic wovens over their chain to prevent frame damage.</p><p><strong>Check the ratings.</strong> Some bike insurance companies will insure stolen bikes only if locked with specific locks. (See the FAQ below for more details.)</p><p><strong>Is there a warranty?</strong> What will the company do if the bike is stolen and the lock is broken?</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Bike Locks</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173318/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173318/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike.jpg\" alt=\"hiplok chain bike lock around a bicycle and wheel\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173318/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike.jpg 1024w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173318/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173318/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173318/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173318/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173318/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike-696x522.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173318/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike-560x420.jpg 560w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173318/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike-80x60.jpg 80w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173318/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike-265x198.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></p><p><strong>Why do I need a bike lock?</strong><br>According to <a href=\"https://www.markelinsurance.com/resources/bicycle/bike-theft#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20over%20188%2C500%20bicycle,bicycle%20thefts%20that%20go%20unreported.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Markel Insurance</a>, more than 188,500 bikes are reported stolen each year in the US. And those are just the reported thefts—a shocking amount of bikes that are stolen go unreported, since many consider the hassle of filing reports and paperwork to be not worth it for bikes that are older or inexpensive. Securing your bike with a solid bike lock can help your bike avoid being added to that ever-growing number.</p><p><strong>What kind of bike lock do I need?</strong><br>As one rider reminded us, context is important. “In Toronto, where theft was rampant, I swore by a Kryptonite lock,” he says. “I now live in Munich, and most people just free lock their bike with a cable lock.</p><p>Often it feels unnecessary to lug a heavy lock around.” Most of your bike lock decision should be based on where you ride and how long you’ll lock your bike, as well as what you’ll commonly be locking it to.</p><p><strong>What types of bike locks are there?</strong><br>You may be confused at the labels on some locks as you’re looking through. Here’s a quick run down:</p><ul><li><strong>U-locks (or D-locks):</strong> Shaped like a U with a bolt on the top, these metal locks are harder to fit around lampposts or railings, but work well with bike racks and are harder for a bike thief to cut through than a cable or chain lock. Their downfall is that they’re hard to use unless there’s a bike rack or thin pole around.</li><li><strong>Folding locks:</strong> These locks are midway between a cable and a U-lock. They’re a bit more compact than a cable since they fold down, and they’re a bit stronger. They can also be a bit more awkward to use, though.</li><li><strong>Chain locks:</strong> The burly chain locks are great options for deterring bike thieves, as long as the lock itself is strong. Usually, a chain lock will come with a small U-lock that actually locks the ends of the chain together. These are ideal for higher-risk situations, and while they’re heavy and take up a lot of space, they’re pretty easy to use in most places.</li><li><strong>Cable locks:</strong> Cable locks are inexpensive, widely available at bike shops and big box stores, and provide the longest options for securing a bunch of bikes, and can be a decent deterrent in low-risk areas. But, these locks tend to be the easiest to cut through, so we don’t include many on the list. They do make a great add-on to a U-Lock, though, helping you secure both wheels at the same time.</li></ul><figure id=\"attachment_266949\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-266949\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173313/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173313/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike-2.jpg\" alt=\"a bicycle chain lock shown stretched to the max to fit around wheel, frame and rack\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173313/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike-2.jpg 1024w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173313/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike-2-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173313/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike-2-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173313/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike-2-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173313/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173313/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike-2-696x522.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173313/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike-2-560x420.jpg 560w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173313/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike-2-80x60.jpg 80w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29173313/hiplok-bike-lock-chained-around-yuba-cargo-bike-2-265x198.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-266949\">The Hiplok Gold just barely made it around the frame, wheel and bike rack.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>How long of a chain bike lock do I need?</strong><br>Our top picks range from about 20″ up to 38″, and the short answer is “longer is better”. The more length, the easier it’ll be to wrap around bigger or farther items while being sure to at least loop it through the frame and front wheel.</p><p><strong>How do I lock my bike?</strong><br>Again, this depends on context, but generally, try to lock as many easy-to-remove parts as possible, make sure the frame is secure, and that it’s actually attached to the thing you’re locking it to. (We’ve made the awkward mistake in the past of locking a bike making sure to get both wheels and the frame secured, then forgot to get the cable around the&nbsp; post we were trying to attach it to.)</p><p>At a minimum, lock your frame to something secure. Try to get your front wheel in there, too. If it’s a really bad area and you have quick-release or non-lockable axles, remove the front wheel and lock it together with the frame and rear wheel…to something secure.</p><figure id=\"attachment_266953\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-266953\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29174425/improper-bicycle-locking-method.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29174425/improper-bicycle-locking-method.jpg\" alt=\"a bicycle with its wheels stolen in NYC\" width=\"1100\" height=\"825\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29174425/improper-bicycle-locking-method.jpg 1100w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29174425/improper-bicycle-locking-method-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29174425/improper-bicycle-locking-method-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29174425/improper-bicycle-locking-method-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29174425/improper-bicycle-locking-method-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29174425/improper-bicycle-locking-method-696x522.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29174425/improper-bicycle-locking-method-1068x801.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29174425/improper-bicycle-locking-method-560x420.jpg 560w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29174425/improper-bicycle-locking-method-80x60.jpg 80w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/29174425/improper-bicycle-locking-method-265x198.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-266953\">Only lock up the things you want to keep.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>What does the Sold Secure rating mean?</strong><br>The <a href=\"https://www.soldsecure.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">UK-based Sold Secure company</a> conducts unbiased third party testing on all types of locks. Originally founded in 1992 by two police departments and the Home Office in Great Britain, the company now works with locksmiths, police and insurers to rate locks. Locks that get the Sold Secure Seal of Approval are also given bronze, silver, or gold status, with gold being the most secure. The <a href=\"https://www.soldsecure.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sold Secure Approved Product list</a> is searchable and contains hundreds of rated bike locks. (Of course, remember that just because Sold Secure gives a lock a gold rating, it’s not a 100% guarantee of theft protection. Where and how you use the lock plays a major role, and every lock is fallible.)</p><p><strong>Are there ratings I should look for?</strong><br>Many brands, including Abus and Kryptonite, have their own security ratings. Abus runs from 1 to 15, while Kryptonite is on a 1-10 scale. These rankings give you a sense of how easy the locks are to pick or cut: The higher the ranking, the harder your bike will be to steal. And definitely check to see if your lock is ranked on third party tester Sold Secure’s lists. You can scan the <a href=\"https://www.soldsecure.com/search?product_type_id&amp;product_type_caption&amp;grading=303&amp;company&amp;action&amp;paged=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">full list of Gold rated locks right here.</a></p><p><strong>Do I need bike insurance?</strong><br>Bike insurance might be a great idea, especially if you have an expensive bike that you leave locked outside often. But make sure that your lock is approved by the company: A lot of bike insurance companies won’t insure your bike unless it is locked with a <a href=\"https://www.soldsecure.com/search?product_type_id&amp;product_type_caption&amp;grading=303&amp;company&amp;action&amp;paged=2\">Gold-rated Sold Secure lock.</a> You can scan the full list of Gold-rated locks right here.</p><p><strong>What do I do if my bike is stolen?</strong><br>Before this is an issue (and hopefully it never is!), document everything. This means keeping your receipts from bike purchases as well as the receipt from your bike lock purchase. (If you buy extras for your bike, like a pricey wheelset, save those receipts as well.)</p><p>You should also take plenty of pictures of your bike <em>before it gets stolen</em> (meaning, go do it now), which can help both in bike retrieval and insurance claims. Be sure to snap a pic of the serial number, which is usually stamped or printed under the bottom bracket.</p><p>If your bike is stolen, report it to the police and your insurance company ASAP. If you don’t have bike insurance, check your homeowner or renter policy if you have one. If your bike was stolen at work, inquire if they have any coverage for theft. You’d be surprised at what some insurance companies will cover, so leave no stone left unturned!</p><p>We’ve also heard of more riders hiding things like the Apple AirTag or <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/05/04/invoxia-cellular-gps-tracker-locates-your-bike-scooter-car-or-luggage-for-just-30g/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a GPS tracker</a> somewhere on their bike (like in a saddlebag) so they can track it if it does get stolen.</p><p><span><em>Disclosure: Some of these links are affiliate links that may earn a small commission for Bikerumor if you click on them and buy something.
