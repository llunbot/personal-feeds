Chen, in a column at The New York Times headlined “Why a Tariff-Inflated $2,000 iPhone Is Nothing to Fear”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Don’t panic. Even if tariffs did cause the iPhone’s price to\nsurge, we would have plenty of cheaper options, like buying last\nyear’s phone model instead of the latest and greatest.</p>\n\n<p>The most important lesson we can learn from the turmoil: The only\nconsistent way to save money on tech is to use devices for as long\nas possible, which requires maintaining them as you would a car,\nand upgrading only when you must.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This whole angle is no surprise coming from the tech columnist whose advice to readers who think their aging phone cameras don’t perform well in low light is “<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2019/09/you_could_always_just_use_flash\">Just use flash</a>.” If phone prices go up because of Trump’s tariffs, <em>all</em> phone prices are going to go up, including those for older models, whether you’re buying new or used. There is no silver lining here. Spending more to get a years-old phone sucks too.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Take the iPhone 16 as an example. Its $800 price tag can easily\ninflate to $1,080, since you may also buy:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>An iPhone case for $50</li>\n<li>AirPods for $130</li>\n<li>256 gigabytes of storage for $100</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So if you buy things that aren’t an iPhone — like AirPods — the price of an iPhone goes up. Got it.</p>\n\n<p>The anti-“big tech” bias here is so obvious. Don’t hold your breath waiting for a similar article in the Times about how it’s no big deal, nothing to worry about, if the price of cars doubles under these tariffs.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/17/spending-more-to-get-less-is-good\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"adbc6f3014eecd65a80a44afeb6b130c434fe5bbf895dbf8a5c9f4a61e82e0e7","category":"Tech"}
