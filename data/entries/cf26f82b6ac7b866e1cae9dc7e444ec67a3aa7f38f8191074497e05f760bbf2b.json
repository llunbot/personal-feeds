Presumably, Pidcock will be defending his Olympic mountain bike title, which he won using an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/tom-pidcock-bmc-fourstroke/\">unbranded BMC Fourstroke</a>.</p>\n<p>The brand says the Dogma XC is part of its “renewed focus” on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike/\">mountain bikes</a> and there is also a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hardtail-mountain-bikes/\">hardtail</a> frame in development.</p>\n<h2>Split flex stays</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The split rear triangle removes the need for a bridge between the seatstays and chainstays.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pinarello</i></span></div>\n<p>Pinarello says it has recruited a dedicated MTB R&amp;D team to help bring Pidcock’s race requirements to life.</p>\n<p>The frame features a flex-stay suspension system, that uses the flexible areas built into the carbon fibre rear triangle to provide <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">rear-wheel travel</a>.</p>\n<p>Pinarello says it decided on this design because it reduces the number of pivot points needed and allows for greater stiffness while reducing weight and supposedly improving rear-wheel traction.</p>\n<p>Flex stays have become increasingly popular on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cross-country-bikes/\">cross-country mountain bikes</a>, with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/cannondale-scalpel-se-ltd-lefty-review/\">Cannondale Scalpel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/2022-giant-anthem-advanced-pro-29-1-review/\">Giant Anthem</a> using the technology in the name of weight saving.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Dogma XC has Pinarello’s signature asymmetrical design.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pinarello</i></span></div>\n<p>Pinarello’s design sees the use of a patent-pending split rear triangle. The triangle uses two distinct ‘semi-triangles’, which attach to a main rotation point moulded into the carbon frame, removing the bridges from the seatstays and chainstays.</p>\n<p>Pinarello claims removing the conventional bridging section has enabled it to reduce chainstay lengths and limit mud accumulation in the area, while maintaining clearance for 2.35in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\">mountain bike tyres</a>.</p>\n<p>The Dogma XC still features Pinarello’s signature asymmetrical design, which reinforces the left-hand side of the rear triangle to counterbalance the higher forces applied to the driveside. This is said to balance energy transfer.</p>\n<h2>Bottom bracket design</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bottom-bracket junction has a cutaway section.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pinarello</i></span></div>\n<p>The Pinarello Dogma XC has a unique bottom bracket design with a strut running from the down tube to the seat tube, creating a triangular void in the bottom of the frame.</p>\n<p>Pinarello says this design optimises stiffness and accommodates an oversized bearing and pivot point for the rear triangle.</p>\n<p>The bike’s front triangle can fit two <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-water-bottles/\">water bottles</a>, according to Pinarello.</p>\n\n<h2>Rear-travel adjustment</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You can fit a 100mm or 120mm rear shock to the Dogma XC.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pinarello</i></span></div>\n<p>The Dogma XC has a top-tube mounted rear shock with an adjustable shock mount.</p>\n<p>The top-tube mounted shock is similar to what we’ve seen on other modern cross-country bikes. The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2020-trek-supercaliber/\">Trek Supercaliber</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/specialized-s-works-epic-world-cup/\">Specialized Epic World Cup</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-wilier-urta-max-slr/\">Wilier Urta Max SLR</a> use a top-tube mounted shock.</p>\n<p>Pinarello says this design allows the Dogma XC to be set up with different suspension travel for differing courses. The bike can be set up with either a 100mm suspension fork and 90mm shock, or a 120mm fork and 100mm shock combo.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike comes with a MOST handlebar.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pinarello</i></span></div>\n<p>Pinarello’s component brand MOST has made a fully integrated flat-bar <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-handlebars/\">mountain bike handlebar</a> for the Dogma XC. The handlebar features integrated cable routing and a stopper to prevent the bar from twisting in a crash and cables being ripped from the levers.</p>\n<p>The bike has internal routing for a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper post</a> and has a maximum chainring size of 40 teeth.</p>\n<h2>Pinarello Dogma XC geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tom Pidcock riding the Pinarello Dogma XC.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pinarello</i></span></div>\n<p>The Dogma XC is on trend for current cross-country bikes, with a medium-sized frame featuring a head angle of 67.5 degrees and a reach measurement of 455mm.</p>\n<p>The actual head angle changes through the sizes.
