At the time, Signify said a software update that would bring compatibility to its Philips Hue lineup would be available to all users in the first quarter of 2023, which comes to a close this Friday.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBut responding to a request by <em><a href=\"https://hueblog.com/2023/03/27/philips-hue-and-matter-no-more-concrete-launch-date/\">hueblog.com</a></em> on Monday for more information, the company offered the following update:\r<br />\n<blockquote>For the launch of Matter, we are working together with many partners in the smart home industry. With Philips Hue, we always focus on convincing quality to meet our customers' expectations. Therefore, we will take a little more time than originally planned for the Philips Hue Bridge software update before making it available to all consumers. We will inform you as soon as we have a concrete date for the release of the Matter software update.</blockquote>Matter is a connectivity standard that enables smart home accessories to work together seamlessly across multiple platforms, including Apple's HomeKit, Amazon's Alexa, Google's Home, and others. For households with multiple smart home platforms or different smartphone brands, it means the Matter lights can be controlled from any device. Both Android and iPhone users can control a Matter-enabled accessory from their respective devices, provided the proper hub setup is available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple added support for Matter on the iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV with iOS 16.1, iPadOS 16, and tvOS 16.1 last year, with a HomePod or Apple TV required to control Matter accessories in the Home app or with Siri. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/philips-hue/\">Philips Hue</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/matter/\">Matter</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/28/philips-hue-delays-matter-support-update/\">Philips Hue Bridge Matter Support Update Appears to Have Been Delayed</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/philips-hue-bridge-matter-support-update-appears-to-have-been-delayed.2385060/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"26fa7fa7f92b83cb7cf178378981f4d44c2f95c58f5a90a6e38b9798181e9d5e","category":"Apple"}
