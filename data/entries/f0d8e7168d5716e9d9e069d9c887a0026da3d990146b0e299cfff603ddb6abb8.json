Although the company is famous for pioneering lean methods of manufacturing and being an early pioneer of hybrid electric powertrains, the switch to battery electric vehicles caught it somewhat unprepared. As rivals <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/ford-secures-battery-supplies-for-600000-evs-a-year-from-2023/\">locked up contracts</a> for critical minerals and formed <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/10/honda-and-lg-are-investing-3-5-billion-in-new-ohio-battery-factory/\">joint ventures</a> with battery makers (<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/volkswagen-starts-building-the-first-of-six-battery-gigafactories/\">or built their own</a>), Toyota has appeared to fall behind.</p>\n<p>Now, it has released a new roadmap showing how it will regain competitiveness and sell 3.5 million EVs by 2030.</p>\n<p>After some early experiments with electric-converted RAV4s (including a partnership with Tesla), Toyota has finally released a modern BEV, the bZ4x.

A look at the car's specs makes clear Toyota's problem, though: There are different battery packs for the single-motor and dual-motor versions, made by Panasonic and CATL, respectively.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969264#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969264&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
