Although the second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌ feature the same design as their predecessor, they improve on features like Active Noise Cancellation, in-ear detection, and battery life, while introducing new functionality like Adaptive Transparency, volume adjustment touch controls, and precision finding.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn late 2020, Apple announced the ‌AirPods Max‌, a whole new AirPods variant with an over-ear design. Both the ‌AirPods Max‌ and the ‌AirPods Pro‌ feature Active Noise Cancellation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, Hey <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, and automatic switching. In September 2024, the company refreshed the ‌AirPods Max‌'s selection of color options and swapped the Lightning port for USB-C.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs the two high-end AirPods options, should you consider purchasing the $249 third-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌, or do you need the ‌AirPods Max‌, which still sell for $549?

with features like Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency, the entirely different fit and form factor of the headphones should make it easier for most customers to decide which device they prefer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌AirPods Max‌ offer a wide range of color options and a more premium design, as well as much longer continuous battery life from a single charge. Owing to its over-ear design and significantly larger drivers, the ‌AirPods Max‌ deliver markedly better audio quality than the ‌AirPods Pro‌, so if your main priority is audio quality, the ‌AirPods Max‌ will undoubtedly be the best choice. If you actively dislike the in-ear design of the ‌AirPods Pro‌, the ‌AirPods Max‌ may also be more comfortable. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn the other hand, the ‌AirPods Pro‌ offer a high-level of convenience and portability due to their small size and charging case. The audio quality of ‌AirPods Pro‌ cannot rival ‌AirPods Max‌, but features like Adaptive Audio, Loud Sound Reduction, and Conversation Boost are ideal for when you're on the go. Due to their lightweight, in-ear design and sweat and water resistance, the ‌AirPods Pro‌ are also perfect for workouts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌AirPods Pro‌ are much more versatile when it comes to charging, with four different ways to charge, compared to the ‌AirPods Max‌'s obligatory USB-C or Lightning port option, depending on whether you buy the latest version. Due to their size, weight, less durable design, and limited portability, the ‌AirPods Max‌ are best used at home for high-fidelity, prolonged listening sessions, while the ‌AirPods Pro‌ offer a more balanced experience with a high level of convenience and portability.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is also worth noting that the ‌AirPods Pro‌ have many more features than the ‌AirPods Max‌, such as \"‌‌Siri‌‌\" voice commands, Precision Finding, Bluetooth 5.3, and lossless audio support, as well as the new hearing protection, testing, and aid features. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAirPods frequently see hefty discounts on Amazon and other third-party retailers, so stepping up to the Max version may be more worth it if you can take advantage of one of those deals. Both sets of AirPods often see solid discounts, so it is always worth seeking the best price <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/#airpods\">using our Deals roundup</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max\">AirPods Max (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-vs-airpods-max/\">AirPods Pro vs. AirPods Max Buyer's Guide: 30+ Differences Compared</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-pro-vs-airpods-max-buyers-guide-30-differences-compared.2364120/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cca16b0cdec325cad17ece145be7640efa348bb0a3eab54029c60af7345b5f80","category":"Apple"}
