However, </span>because road bike tyres generally all look so similar, it’s not always easy to spot the difference between a good tyre and a bad tyre.</p>\n<p>Upgrading your bike’s stock tyres to something better, whether that be in terms of greater volume, decreased rolling resistance, improved cornering grip or simply increased <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/how-to-prevent-punctures/\">puncture protection</a>, can transform your riding experience.</p>\n<p><span>The good news is this – compared to other <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-components/\">bike parts</a>, getting the best road bike tyres needn’t cost the earth. </span></p>\n<p><span>Every tyre on this list has an RRP of around £70 or less per tyre, and can most often be found at a discount. That’s not a trivial amount of money but, as a component that has a significant impact on how your bike rides, it’s a relatively <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/best-cheap-road-bike-upgrades-2/\">cheap upgrade for your road bike</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, the choice of road bike tyres available on the market can be a little overwhelming. The devil really is in the detail, so we’ve put our team of expert testers to the task, logging thousands of kilometres – and even spending time in a lab – to find the best road bike tyres available. </span></p>\n<p>We’ve also put together a guide at the end of this article explaining <a href=\"#road-tyres-buyers-guide\">everything you need to know about road bike tyres</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Best road bike tyres in 2023, as rated by our expert testers</h2>\n<h3>Continental Grand Prix 5000 S TR</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Continental GP5000S TR on Hunt 54 Aerodynamicist wheel\" title=\"20211220_SB_5DSR_MG_4880\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Continental GP5000 S TR is a superb tubeless road tyre.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £69.95/$98.95/€79.90 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Type:</strong> Tubeless-ready</li>\n<li><strong>Colour options:</strong> Black or ‘transparent’ tan</li>\n<li><strong>Size and width options:</strong> 700x25c, 700x28c, 700x30c and 700x32c</li>\n<li><strong>Size tested:</strong> 700x28c</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 280g</li>\n<li><strong>TPI:</strong> 220</li>\n<li><strong>Verdict:</strong> The benchmark tubeless road tyre for all things fast</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Continental Grand Prix 5000 S TR arrived as the replacement for the German brand’s previous road tubeless tyre, the GP5000 TL.</p>\n<p>In short, it’s a fast, grippy and lightweight tubeless tyre.

There’s a 127 TPI casing for a high-quality ride over bumpy roads.</p>\n<p>You need to keep the tyre pressure up with the Fusion 5 Performance tyres though, because they don’t like pressures below Hutchinson’s 74psi recommended minimum.</p>\n<p>That’s higher than we ran some of the other tyres tested.

And, of course, our reviews will let you know how those claims stack up in the real world.</p>\n<h3>Types of tyre</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Clincher vs tubeless vs tubular\" title=\"Clincher vs tubeless vs tubular\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There are three types of road bike tyre: clincher, tubeless and tubular.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Hunt Bike Wheels</i></span></div>\n<p>Tyres for road bikes come in three styles: clincher, tubeless and tubular.</p>\n<h4>Clincher tyres</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Butyl inner tubes\" title=\"Conti_MTB_27.5_Conti_700x32-47C_Schwalbe_700x18-28C.jpg_01\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Clincher tyres require the use of an inner tube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley/Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Clinchers are the most common type of tyres found on road bikes. They have an open casing that houses a separate inner tube and is held on the wheel by the rim bead hooks.</p>\n<p>The main advantage of clinchers is that they make fixing a flat easy because all you have to do to get at the punctured tube is prise off one side of the tyre. This usually requires a tyre lever or two, but with some tyres you can do it with just your thumbs.</p>\n<p>There are two types of clinchers: folding and non-folding. The difference is in the material used to make the bead (the part that hooks onto the rim).</p>\n<p>Folding clinchers generally use Kevlar, a durable material that – as the name suggests – allows the tyres to be folded. Non-folding clinchers use a bead made from steel wire and can’t be folded.</p>\n<p>Folding clinchers are more expensive, but they’re also lighter and are easier to get on and off a rim. The fact that they fold isn’t really important as far as riding is concerned, but it does usually mean such tyres have slightly lower levels of rolling resistance.</p>\n<h4>Tubeless tyres</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Bora Ultra WTO wheelset\" title=\"Campagnolo Bora Ultra WTO wheelset\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tubeless tyres use sealant to seal up small cuts before they become punctures.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Campagnolo</i></span></div>\n<p>Tubeless tyres have been a mainstay in the mountain biking world for some time and they’ve now come to road cycling.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests, tubeless tyres don’t use an inner tube. They’re very similar to standard clinchers except that the tyre and rim seal together to become airtight and remain inflated, just like the tyres on most modern cars.</p>\n<p>Such an airtight seal can’t be achieved with any old rim and tyre though. A tubeless setup not only requires tubeless-specific tyres (which have a special stretch-resistant tyre bead) and rims but also a special valve, viscous liquid sealant and special rim tape.</p>\n<p>The idea is that removing the inner tube from the equation reduces weight and rolling resistance, and, without said inner tube, you can also run lower tyre pressures without the fear of a pinch flat, meaning a more comfortable ride and more grip.</p>\n<p>The addition of the<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/which-tubeless-sealant-works-the-best/\"> tubeless sealant</a> can help eliminate punctures from small, sharp objects.</p>\n<p>This is particularly welcome on tyres designed for going off-road and delicate racing tyres such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/schwalbe-pro-one-tubeless-tyre-released/\">Schwalbe Pro One TT</a> and Vittoria Corsa Speed, which use thin casings and eschew puncture protection strips in order to reduce rolling resistance to the absolute minimum.</p>\n<p>If the puncture hole can’t be sealed by sealant alone (because it’s too large, for example), you still have the option of fitting an inner tube, or there are ‘tyre worm’ <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-repair-tubeless-puncture/\">tubeless repair kits</a> such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/maintenance/tools-kits-and-boxes/puncture-repair-kit/stans-notubes-dart-tubeless-repair-kit-review/\">Stan’s NoTubes DART</a>.</p>\n<p>Tubeless tyres aren’t a panacea, however. In order to aid air retention, manufacturers sometimes have to make the tyre casing thicker and heavier than on a standard clincher tyre, which can dull ride feel and increase rolling resistance.</p>\n<p>They can also be far more difficult to install if you get a rim and tyre combination that doesn’t play nice, and you may also need an air compressor or special ‘flash’ pump to properly seat the tyre bead.</p>\n<p>Much of the bike industry, and particularly wheel and tyre manufacturers, are convinced tubeless is the future for road cycling, though. In fact, it’s quite unusual to see a new tyre or wheelset without tubeless compatibility these days.</p>\n<p>Some brands are even beginning to release <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/hookless-rims-road-tubeless/\">hookless rims for road use</a>, on which the bead hooks have been eliminated. This means compatibility is limited to tubeless tyres only because standard clincher tyres (which have much stretchier tyre beads) require the bead hooks to prevent them from blowing off the rim when inflated.</p>\n<h4>Tubular tyres</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Mechanics pre-stretch tubulars for easier mounting\" title=\"1435871854249-1jb5pgodc19dj-bd91625\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tubular tyres see the inner tube sewn directly into the tyre, which is then glued on to a tubular rim.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ben Delaney / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Historically, pro riders have used tubular tyres for racing, though that is beginning to change with the growing popularity of tubeless.</p>\n<p>With tubeless technology now beginning to gain prominence in both the pro peloton and with everyday riders, expect tubulars to become even more marginalised.</p>\n<p>However, it’s still worth us recapping on the potential advantages and disadvantages of tubulars.</p>\n<p>Tubulars still rely on an inner tube but, instead of the casing being open, like on a clincher, it’s sewn shut around the inner tube, so that the pairing takes on a tubular form – hence the name.</p>\n<p>The tyre then has to be glued (or taped using special double-sided tape) onto a rim specifically made for tubular tyres.</p>\n<p>Unlike rims designed for clinchers, tubular rims don’t have bead hooks inside the sidewalls for a tyre to clinch onto. Tubulars rely on tyre pressure and glue to hold them on the rim.</p>\n<p>Some riders still swear by tubular tyres, claiming they offer a superior ‘feel’. This can largely be attributed to the fact that until recent years, many tyre manufacturers only released their fastest tyres in tubular form.</p>\n<p>Tubular tyres also tend to have <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tubs-vs-clinchers-which-are-faster/\">slightly higher rolling resistance</a> than an equivalent clincher because of frictional losses in the glue.</p>\n<p>But the big, tangible advantage to tubular systems for road use is that the equivalent tubular rims can be made much lighter than a clincher or tubeless-ready rim. This makes them extremely popular with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/weight-weenie-heres-why-its-not-your-fault/\">weight weenies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/hill-climb-tech-gallery/\">hill climb obsessives</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Mounting tubulars sticky with wet glue is not as easy as pro mechanics make it look\" title=\"1435871854264-11c4lsscuh7pe-1000-100-5d5abe9\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Having a pro mechanic to glue your tyres on to your rims makes using tubular systems much easier.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ben Delaney / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A second, more esoteric advantage is that tubular tyres can still be ridden when punctured. This is because they won’t separate from the rim, unlike clinchers, meaning a rider may be able to continue riding until the punctured wheel can be changed.</p>\n<p>Tubulars are also said to be more resistant to ‘pinch flats’, where the inner tube is pinched between the rim and tyre, usually caused by hitting a sharp-edged obstacle such as a pothole. This is probably more a function of the tendency to run tubulars at higher pressures than their construction, though.</p>\n<p>The disadvantages of tubulars – which tend to be felt much more keenly by regular cyclists than the pros with team mechanics – are that having to glue tyres to the rim makes the initial installation laborious (although tubular tape arguably eases this issue) and sorting a puncture during a ride can be very difficult.</p>\n<p>Your two options are using a CO2 inflator cartridge containing sealant and hoping it can seal the hole, or tearing off the punctured tubular and replacing it with another, which obviously means riding with a spare (actually repairing a punctured tubular, rather than simply replacing it, means breaking out the sewing kit).</p>\n<p>You can – very carefully – ride home on a spare tubular stretched over a rim, but you must glue this new tubular in place before your next ride.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-glue-a-tubular-tyre/\">Gluing a tubular</a> is no piece of cake either. It requires attention to detail and plenty of patience because a bad job can result in the tyre rolling off the rim, likely causing a dangerous crash.</p>\n<h2>Rolling resistance continued…</h2>\n<p><span>As already noted at the beginning of this article, there are a lot of factors that determine the rolling resistance of a tyre. Let’s explore those in more detail.</span></p>\n<h3>Tyre construction</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Schwalbe Pro One TT Tubeless Easy tyre\" title=\"Schwalbe Pro One TT Tubeless Easy tyre\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tyres with a lightweight casing will often roll faster, but that may come at the cost of durability and puncture protection.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott/Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Tyres with thinner treads and higher TPI casings tend to be more supple, and thus require less energy to deform. This in turn means less energy is lost to hysteresis, which decreases rolling resistance.</span></p>\n<p><span>The exact recipe of the rubber compound used in the tyre’s tread makes a large difference too. Additives such as silica or graphene are used to reduce losses to friction and hysteresis, but each manufacturer guards its own exact recipe very carefully.</span></p>\n<p><span>Increasing the thickness of the rubber tread or adding puncture protection strips or layers can also affect rolling resistance by increasing the amount of energy required to deform the tyre.</span></p>\n<p><span>The fastest tyres combine supple casings, thin treads and low-friction rubber compounds. The downsides to these tyres though are usually significantly decreased puncture protection and service life.</span></p>\n<p><span>Tyres that use thicker treads on stiffer casings will be slower, but you’ll generally also get better puncture protection and service life. </span></p>\n<p><span>For this reason, many riders will switch to tyres such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/continental-gatorskin-road-tyre-review/\">Continental Gatorskin</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/schwalbe-durano-road-tire-review/\">Schwalbe Durano</a> during the winter, when the increased rolling resistance is less of a concern than the prospect of having to fix punctures with cold hands.</span></p>\n<p><span>It’s a well worn cliché, but it’s also true that nothing is slower than a puncture. Time trial tyres are unlikely to be the best choice for training, long-distance sportives or commuting. Choose tyres that have the right balance of characteristics for your personal riding needs.</span></p>\n<h3>Tyre width</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Parcours Strade wheels\" title=\"20200908_SB_5DSR_MG_2839\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Road bike tyres are getting wider.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>The main thing you need to know is that, for most people, wider tyres are generally faster and more comfortable.</span></p>\n<p><span>This is because, at the same pressure, wider tyres have a shorter contact patch with the road than narrow tyres and this decreases the deformation of the tyre, which decreases rolling resistance.</span></p>\n<p><span>Of course, in the real world, we tend to run wider tyres at lower pressures than narrow ones, which can cancel out that rolling resistance advantage, but you also get increased comfort and grip with the wider tyre, which makes a big difference to how fast you can ride on imperfect roads.</span></p>\n<p><span>The only downsides are that wider tyres increase weight and aerodynamic drag slightly, meaning they require a little more energy to accelerate and push through the air. The benefits of wider tyres outweigh these marginal losses at the speeds most of us ride, though.</span></p>\n<p><span>The tables only really turn at the higher speeds seen in time trials or on the track (because the faster you ride, the more aerodynamics matter), but with modern wheels now designed around 25mm or wider tyres, there’s very little reason to choose 23mm or narrower tyres anymore.</span></p>\n<h3>Tyre pressure</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Road bike tyre pressure\" title=\"Road bike tyre pressure\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Fine-tuning your tyre pressure can improve speed, grip, comfort and puncture protection.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>We’ve got a full guide to optimising <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/road-bike-tyre-pressure/\">road bike tyre pressure</a>, but let’s cover the basics here.</p>\n<p>On a perfectly smooth surface, like rollers or an indoor track, higher pressures mean less tyre deformation and therefore lower rolling resistance.</p>\n<p>As most people know all too well, in the real world the roads we actually ride on are not perfectly smooth. In fact, if you were to look very closely, even the smoothest road is actually full of small holes, bumps and imperfections.</p>\n<p>Because of this, tyres run at too high pressures have a tendency to bounce over the road surface. This may feel fast, but it’s actually slowing you down because the energy you’re putting through the pedals isn’t contributing to driving the bike forward when the tyre isn’t in contact with the ground.</p>\n<p>Lowering your tyre pressure enables the tyre to act as a kind of suspension system, keeping your rubber in contact with the road more of the time and wasting less of your energy input.</p>\n<p>The key to tyre pressure is finding the right balance between having it high enough to minimise tyre deformation but low enough to absorb the vibrations and keep the rubber in contact with the surface you’re riding on.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there’s no hard and fast rule for what pressure this will be for you because, just like <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/trail-tech-mountain-bike-tyre-pressure-all-you-need-to-know/\">mountain bike tyre pressures</a>, it depends on myriad factors such as what kinds of terrain you ride on, what wheels and tyres you’re using and how much you weigh.</p>\n<p>The best advice we can offer is to follow the manufacturer’s recommendations, experiment with different pressures and err on the side of being slightly too low instead of slightly too high. That way you’ll at least be more comfortable and have more grip.</p>\n<h3>Inner tubes and tubeless</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Inner tubes\" title=\"Inner tubes: everything you need to know\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Even the type of inner tube you use will have a small but measurable effect on rolling resistance.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley/Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>The inner tubes in a clincher or tubular system are also the source of some frictional and hysteresis losses.</span></p>\n<p><span>Thinner, lighter inner tubes generally contribute less to rolling resistance because there is less material to deform, meaning they’re more flexible.</span></p>\n<p><span>Latex inner tubes, though more expensive than standard butyl inner tubes, offer even less rolling resistance because latex is more supple than butyl and requires less energy to deform.</span></p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Persona installing an inner tube.\" title=\"How to fit tight bike tyres 05\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Using a latex inner tube can help reduce rolling resistance.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Yogamaya von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Tubeless systems offer reduced rolling resistance by eliminating the inner tube altogether. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, it’s not as simple as saying ‘tubeless is therefore faster’ because tubeless tyres often have more material added to the tyre itself to make it airtight, which can increase the rolling resistance of the tyre compared to an equivalent clincher.</span></p>\n<p><span>The amount of sealant added to a tubeless tyre system has also been shown to affect rolling resistance (adding more sealant than you need increases rolling resistance), so we’d always recommend following the manufacturer’s instructions.</span></p>\n<h2>Anatomy of a tyre</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bike tyre components\" title=\"Bike tyre components\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This graphic from Vittoria shows some of the key parts of a road bike tyre’s construction.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Vittoria</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bead:</strong> This is what holds clincher and tubeless tyres on the wheel rim. The air pressure inside the tyre pushes the beads out, making them hook onto the rim. Wheels with hookless rims require the use of tyres with a tubeless-specific bead because standard clincher tyre beads may stretch off the rim when inflated, leading to a potentially dangerous blowout.</li>\n<li><strong>Casing:</strong> This is cloth fabric ‘woven’ around the beads that creates the main body of the tyre. While the vast majority use nylon fabric, higher-end tyres may use cotton or silk. The casing has a major effect on ride quality because of the threads per inch (TPI) value. Tyres with a low TPI will have thicker threads, which cause greater rolling resistance but make the tyre more resistant to punctures. Meanwhile, tyres with a high TPI use finer threads for less rolling resistance and lower weight, but will be more susceptible to punctures.</li>\n<li><strong>Sidewall:</strong> Rubber is applied to the side of the casing between the tread and the bead to form the sidewall. Each tyre will have different rubber compounds and thickness depending on its intended purpose.</li>\n<li><strong>Sub-tread:</strong> Some tyres will have a sub-tread layer to fend off punctures. Cheaper tyres may just have an additional layer of rubber beneath the tread, while those at the higher end of the price range will have specially designed fabric strips. These have an unfortunate side effect of increasing rolling resistance, so are often left out of tyres designed specifically for time trials.</li>\n<li><strong>Tread:</strong> This is the rubber that comes into contact with the road. It’s thicker than the sidewall and sometimes features a three-dimensional pattern. Tread pattern is a hotly debated issue, with many claiming that road bike tyres have no need for tread. However, according to Finnish outfit Wheel Energy, because the texture of any road surface is so varied, some tread patterns provide a measurable mechanical adhesion to the ground. Recent testing even shows that tread pattern can affect the aerodynamic performance of tyres too. The rubber compounds used for different tyres are a closely guarded secret. Generally, softer compounds will offer superior traction but will wear quickly, while harder compounds will stand up to more abuse but won’t have the same grip.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How often should you replace your tyres?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Some tyres have wear indicators, which will dissapear over the life of the tyre\" title=\"gp4000-1481028333010-1mrtfb0dvzmtx-3f5b249\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some tyres have wear indicators, which will disappear over the life of the tyre.
