Now, the energy company will just operate a trio of hydrogen stations for heavy-duty vehicles like class 8 drayage trucks or garbage trucks. It's further confirmation that while hydrogen has a role as a clean fuel for transportation, that will not involve passenger cars, at least not any time soon.</p>\n<p>Shell piloted its first California retail hydrogen station <a href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/2008/06/27/shell-opens-combination-hydrogen-and-gasoline-station-in-la/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAN029sqAn9KHpJ8Q8QB4XE9_hNkvwFNc5UG38815Hzioz0S_oQzhVBT4OTPbNw8Hcos0-OFN99rOKdK6ae4bu4xkekE-TyWCkn6Ui4Tx5HSy2rfkA2lQ8PzwY_WxzFkx7xGIEjqTOIRejKFdOcPkY-O4nDh1F8hWqdzz0BWGsiP5\">in a 2008 pilot program</a> in Los Angeles.
