The former is a pretty extraordinary bit of kit and is absolutely worth reading about, even if you’re not a mountain biker.</p>\n<p>We then rounded out Thursday with two key bike launches, starting with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-trek-top-fuel/\">Trek Top Fuel</a> – which is now a dedicated downcountry slayer – and the all-new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/specialized-s-works-crux-review/\">Specialized Crux</a>, which is claimed to be the world’s lightest gravel bike.</p>\n<p>If that isn’t quite enough for you, sit back and take a deep dive into the best new kit to land at BikeRadar HQ in this week’s edition of First Look Friday.</p>\n<h2>Grepp.cc woven Lyocell handlebar tape</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Could this be the solution to my bar tape woes?</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Grepp is an interesting new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-handlebar-tape/\" target=\"_blank\">handlebar tape</a> made from Tencel, which is a natural cellulose fibre derived from trees.</p>\n<p>In the hand, it feels like a super-soft cotton canvas and is very pliable.</p>\n<p>The outside face of the tape is woven to include a textured surface that provides some additional grip.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The tape has rubber threads woven into it to stop the tape from slipping.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Instead of using an adhesive strip, the back of the tape is woven with 20 natural rubber threads distributed across its full width to stop it slipping.</p>\n<p>The lack of an adhesive means it should be possible to unwrap the tape and fit it to another set of bars. This is particularly useful if you’re keen to experiment with narrower (or wider!) handlebars.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The tape is very soft to the touch.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Should the time come to dispose of the tape, it’s made from fully natural materials, so it should eventually break down in a commercial decomposer.</p>\n<p>The tape has no stretch whatsoever, which should make it possible to get a super-tight wrap.</p>\n<p>Though Grepp doesn’t specifically suggest this, I’ve found soaking cotton handlebar tape prior to wrapping it gives it a bit more elasticity and helps iron out any wrinkles. I suspect a similar trick could be employed here.</p>\n<p>The tape also includes a neat reusable expanding bar end plug that wedges into the handlebar when the central section is pressed in.</p>\n<p>At 270 SEK (approximately €26 / £22), the tape isn’t even that expensive. Given it’s almost infinitely reusable, it also strikes me as great value for money when compared to other premium bar tapes.</p>\n<p>I’ve been experimenting with cotton bar tape for the last few months and my findings have been mixed.</p>\n<p>It’s hard-wearing, feels great in hot or sweaty conditions and looks cool, but oh my goodness – it’s so unbelievably uncomfortable. The tape offers literally zero padding and, on long rides, that can get pretty darn unpleasant.</p>\n<p>Though it’s never going to be as comfortable as a proper gel-backed tape, I reckon Grepp could be just what I’m after and I can’t wait to fit it to one of my bikes.</p>\n<ul><li>270 SEK (approximately €26 / £22)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://grepp.cc/collections/cloth-handlebar-tapes\" target=\"_blank\">Buy direct from Grepp.cc</a></li>\n</ul><h2>Jack front rack</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The rack performs so much better than I was anticipating.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Jack is an all-new tool-free front rack from WholeGrain Cycles that will fit almost any bike with 31.8mm or 25.4mm handlebars.</p>\n<p>To fit the rack, you slide the two plastic clips on the top of the rack onto your bars on their clamping area.</p>\n<p>Next, you take one of the included webbing straps and thread this onto one of the hooks on the back of the rack.</p>\n<p>This then passes under your stem before connecting it to the hook on the other side of the rack. This stops the rack from rotating further forward.</p>\n<p>Finally, you attach an adjustable webbing strap around the steerer tube or head tube to stop the rack from rotating upward.</p>\n<p>Once everything is cinched up, the rack feels really solid – much more so than I anticipated.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> WholeGrain does a great job of showing how the rack fits in this GIF.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wholegrain Cycles</i></span></div>\n<p>The rack is deep enough to easily accommodate a basket or chunky <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bikepacking-bags/\" target=\"_blank\">bikepacking bags</a>.</p>\n<p>The rack itself is made from solid 304 stainless steel and features a replaceable fabric base to stop your luggage from poking through and touching the tyre. The rack and fabric base weigh 677g without the additional straps.</p>\n<p>The Jack ships with a neat matching hookless bungee cord and two carabiners to help you secure whatever load you decide to carry.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It has my name on it, so I simply had to try it out.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>On that note, the rack is rated to carry up to 5kg. While that may not sound like much, you’re unlikely to exceed this, as carrying much more will likely ruin the handling of your bike long before the rack fails.</p>\n<p>The idea for the rack isn’t particularly new – the Nitto F16 has been around for donkey’s years, but this is a much more refined and solid product overall.</p>\n<p>The Jack is available on Kickstarter now – where, as of writing, it has already exceeded its funding goal 23 times over – for £58 / €65 / $70. The RRP will be £60 / €70 / $80 once the rack goes into full production in July 2022.</p>\n<p>Earlybird racks are due to ship in January 2022, with all other orders fulfilled in April 2022. Unusually for a Kickstarter product, the rack also features a two-year warranty, though the exact details of this are yet to be ironed out.</p>\n<ul><li>£60 / $80 / €70</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/milesgibbons/jack-the-bike-rack\" target=\"_blank\">Buy direct from WholeGrain cycles on Kickstarter</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Specialized S-Works Romin with Mirror saddle</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Oh so expensive and oh so good.
