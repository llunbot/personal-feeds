This isn’t necessarily a bad thing.</p>\n<p>Shorter on travel than the Foxy, with 130mm at the rear and 150mm up front, Mondraker says the Raze has “managed to strike the perfect compromise between pedalling efficiency and overall performance”.</p>\n<h3>Is the Raze a true ‘quiver killer’?</h3>\n<p>In essence, the Raze takes inspiration from the Foxy and the company’s XC bike, the F-Podium, to make a super-light (around 2kg for the frame without shock) do-it-all trail bike that it claims is as happy pedalling cross-country loops as it is getting some laps in at the bike park.</p>\n<p>This does beg the question, why get a Foxy, then?</p>\n<p>Mondraker goes some way to explaining in its press release with a couple of paragraphs about quiver killers and questioning boundaries before declaring: “If you’re lucky enough to try one, you won’t want anything else.”</p>\n<h3>The perfect UK trail bike</h3>\n<p>Basically, it’s a bike that is nice and easy to pedal uphill or on flatter trails but with the angles and suspension performance to blast back down, over or through anything in its path – it sounds perfect for UK riding.</p>\n<p>It’s a “mini Foxy”, Mondraker says, which makes you wonder if you need any other bike in your life (doesn’t everyone always need more bikes?).</p>\n<p>The Raze includes Mondraker’s MIND in-built telemetry system to help you achieve a balanced setup without the hassle of testing, adjusting and trying again.</p>\n<p>As soon as you start riding, the system will record and analyse data and suggest pressures and other setup pointers, as well as tell you how much air-time you got on your last ride (which of course makes it indispensable for after-ride bragging rights).</p>\n<p>The frame is constructed using Mondraker’s Stealth Air carbon, with the brand’s Forward Geometry giving a head angle of 65.6 degrees with a 1,243mm wheelbase, 435mm chainstay and 495mm reach on the size L.</p>\n<h2>Revised 2022 Mondraker Foxy Carbon</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The updated Foxy Carbon also features Mondraker’s new built-in telemetry system, ‘MIND’.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mondraker</i></span></div>\n<p>The Foxy has been a staple in Mondraker’s lineup for years; it’s the company’s ‘enduro’ offering that has morphed as the discipline itself has changed over the last decade or so.</p>\n<p>Its carbon iteration was launched in 2015 and the Foxy has benefitted over time from Mondraker’s Forward Geometry, which was thought radical at first but now fits well into the norms for modern mountain bikes.</p>\n<h3>‘More enduro than ever’</h3>\n<p>For 2022, the Foxy Carbon is “more enduro than ever”, according to Mondraker. In terms of frame construction, this means a stiffer carbon layup around the bottom bracket, plus a “modified and reinforced” chainstay.</p>\n<p>The bike keeps its unique look, with that unmissable top tube profile. Another notable addition to the frame is that it now has two frame position settings – Standard and Low – that tweak the head angle by +/- .5 degrees and the chainstay by +/- 10mm.</p>\n<p>Suspension-wise, the Foxy Carbon gets a total overhaul. The Zero Suspension System, which uses two links to compress and control the motion of the rear shock from both ends, has been completely redesigned, giving the bike a totally new kinematic.</p>\n<p>A longer shock stroke also adds to a plusher feel, Mondraker says. Working with its suspension partners throughout the process, the company claims it has been able to perfect the shock tune for this updated system.</p>\n<h3>MIND over matter</h3>\n<p>Like the Raze, perhaps the most exciting revelation in this bike launch, though, is the inclusion of Mondraker’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/mondraker-mind-suspension/\">MIND suspension telemetry system</a>, which is included on all three models.</p>\n<p>This discreet setup hides its technological wizardry in the head tube and several small magnets placed around the suspension workings.</p>\n<p>Using Mondraker’s myMondraker app, you can access a range of data and suggestions to help set up or adjust the bike.</p>\n<h2>2022 Mondraker Raze and Foxy Carbon specs and pricing</h2>\n<h3>2022 Mondraker Raze</h3>\n<p>Four Raze sizes are available (S, M, L, XL), with all three models featuring 29in wheels back and front, 130/150mm rear/front suspension travel, Zero Suspension system, hidden cable routing from the head tube and a threaded bottom bracket.</p>\n<p>A frame kit is available for £3,199.</p>\n<h4>2022 Mondraker Raze RR SL</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Mondraker Raze RR SL.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mondraker</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Frame:</strong> Raze Stealth Air full carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Fork:</strong> Fox 36 29 Float GRIP2 Factory Kashima, 150mm</li>\n<li><strong>Shock:</strong> Fox Float DPS Factory Kashima EVOL LV, 205×57.5mm</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> SRAM G2 RSC</li>\n<li><strong>Cranks:</strong> SRAM X01 Carbon Eagle</li>\n<li><strong>Rims:</strong> DT Swiss XCM1200 Carbon Spline 29, 30mm internal width</li>\n<li><strong>Hubs:</strong> DT 240, Boost</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Maxxis Dissector 29×2.4 WT (front);
