I feel really fortunate to have gone the full circle... so many years on from my first visit to the factory.\"</blockquote>Ive describes the LP12-50 as \"a very gentle and modest project for us that was really motivated by our love and respect for Linn.\" Indeed, according to <em>Fast Company</em>, LoveFrom completed the work <em>pro bono</em>, and has no contract or other financial arrangement with the company.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/jony-ive-turntable1.jpg.jpg\" alt width=\"970\" height=\"546\" />\r<br />\n\"There's a substantial percentage of our work which we do purely for the love of doing it,\" Ive told the website, which noted that the design firm relies on its longer-term contracts with the likes of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/21/jony-ive-lovefrom-airbnb-partnership/\">Airbnb</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/27/ferrari-jony-ive-lovefrom-partnership/\">Ferrari</a> to make money. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nSince leaving Apple to found LoveFrom, Ive and fellow designer Marc Newson have designed a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/12/jony-ive-lovefrom-launches-website/\">typeface</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/13/jony-ive-designs-coronation-emblem/\">emblem</a> for the coronation of King Charles III, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/01/jony-ive-designs-red-nose-comic-relief/\">red clown nose</a> for British charity Comic Relief. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple said in 2019 that Ive would continue to be involved in design at Apple and that it would be one of LoveFrom's primary clients. For example, Ive was reportedly involved in the creation of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/29/jony-ive-involved-in-24-imac/\">2021 iMac</a>. It's unknown whether LoveFrom has worked with Apple since, and the design firm tends to keep a low profile. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jony-ive/\">Jony Ive</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lovefrom/\">LoveFrom</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/07/jony-ive-lovefrom-turntable-linn-design/\">If Apple Designed a Turntable, This Is Probably What It Would Look Like</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/if-apple-designed-a-turntable-this-is-probably-what-it-would-look-like.2395291/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aa0b3081d35c0f1d07a253e5567e6062b5aecb779c145733f9c295daa9c3ab16","category":"Apple"}
