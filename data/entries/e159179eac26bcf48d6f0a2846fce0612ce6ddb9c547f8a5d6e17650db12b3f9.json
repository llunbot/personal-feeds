The refurbished models are discounted by between 15% and 20% compared to the original pricing of these iPads.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple first introduced this particular iPad Air model in March 2022, and the iPad Pro models followed in October of that year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says its refurbished iPads include a new battery and outer shell, a new white box, and all manuals and accessories, including a USB-C charging cable and power adapter. Apple says it puts refurbished devices through a \"thorough cleaning process and inspection,\" and it performs full functionality testing to ensure there are no defective units.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll refurbished iPads are covered by Apple's one-year limited warranty and 14-day return policy, and eligible for AppleCare+ coverage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile some savings can be had here, these are obviously two-year-old iPad models with fewer remaining years of iPadOS support.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/\">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro\">iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/13/refurbished-2022-ipad-pro-and-ipad-air-models/\">Apple Begins Selling Refurbished 2022 iPad Pro and iPad Air Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-begins-selling-refurbished-2022-ipad-pro-and-ipad-air-models.2436207/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e159179eac26bcf48d6f0a2846fce0612ce6ddb9c547f8a5d6e17650db12b3f9","category":"Apple"}
