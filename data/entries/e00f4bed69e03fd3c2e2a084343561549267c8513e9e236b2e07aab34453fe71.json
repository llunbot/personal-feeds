This year, it appears that Revel Bikes may be closing just <em>after</em> Sea Otter, and just after <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/revel-rerun-emtb-ritual-enduro-bike-new-ranger-colors/\" target=\"_blank\">launching three new bikes</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to an email that was sent out to dealers as reported by <a href=\"https://www.bicycleretailer.com/industry-news/2025/04/17/revel-bikes-tells-dealers-it-closing\">BRAIN</a>, <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/page/2/\">the Radavist</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mtbr.com/threads/revel-bikes-to-shut-down-as-financial-pressures-mount.1238493/\">MTBR</a>, Revel Bikes “as it currently stands” is closing. The email cites the brand losing its financial safety net, and control has been given to a bank and the company is in an “orderly wind down.” </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ola-Verploegh-revel-bikes-linkedin.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"680\" height=\"614\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ola-Verploegh-revel-bikes-linkedin.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ola-Verploegh-revel-bikes-linkedin.png 680w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ola-Verploegh-revel-bikes-linkedin-297x268.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ola-Verploegh-revel-bikes-linkedin-120x108.png 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Matt-Boughton-Revel-Bikes-Linkedin.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"535\" height=\"236\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Matt-Boughton-Revel-Bikes-Linkedin.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Matt-Boughton-Revel-Bikes-Linkedin.png 535w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Matt-Boughton-Revel-Bikes-Linkedin-297x131.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Matt-Boughton-Revel-Bikes-Linkedin-120x53.png 120w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, any other indication of the brand closing is very limited, with only Linkedin posts by Product Manager Matt Boughton and Director of Finance Ola Verploegh seemingly confirming the news. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Revel website is also showing host errors when trying to access features like the dealer locator. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve reached out to all of our contacts at Revel to try and gain more information, and we will update this post if we hear back. For now, we’ll be here mourning the loss of yet another awesome bike company. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/revel-bikes-is-apparently-closing-just-after-launching-three-new-bikes/\">Revel Bikes Is Apparently Closing, Just After Launching Three New Bikes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"e00f4bed69e03fd3c2e2a084343561549267c8513e9e236b2e07aab34453fe71","category":"Cycling"}
