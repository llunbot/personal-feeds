He learned how to design and fabricate “better, bigger, and safer” bicycles for tall people. And, he swore to make it look great as well. Now, he is Introducing the DirtySixer 32er Gravel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This 32er Gravel is designed as a planned evolution of their 36″ wheeled bike named the <em>Allroad</em>. The Allroad is a bike made especially for tall riders, and has been in production for a little over a decade. The 32er will be aimed towards riders that are slightly smaller with a projected fit range of 5’10” to 6’8″. Bigger than that, David recommends the 36″ Allroad.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-first-pic-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-first-pic-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"DirtySixer 32er Gravel bike first pic\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-first-pic-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-first-pic-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-first-pic-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-first-pic-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-first-pic-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-first-pic-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / DirtySixer)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After making prototypes around 7 years ago using unicycle rims and tires, DirtySixer now makes their own wheels and tires. However, there are more choices for those items now, even 32er carbon forks. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-front-end-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-front-end-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"DirtySixer 32er Gravel bike front end\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-front-end-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-front-end-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-front-end-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-front-end-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-front-end-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-front-end-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoping to fill the gap between the 29er and the monstrous 36er, the 32er seems to fit where it needs to for the taller rider. It uses a 6061 aluminum frame, with designs and component choices made for the tall and sometimes heavier rider. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-downtube-logo-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-downtube-logo-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"DirtySixer 32er Gravel bike downtube logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-downtube-logo-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-downtube-logo-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-downtube-logo-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-downtube-logo-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-downtube-logo-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-downtube-logo-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>32er Gravel Retail and Specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 32er will rollin custom DirtySixer VeeTire T-Monster 32 x 2.4″ tires. Those tires are mounted to their own double-wall aluminum rims with a 35mm internal width, or a carbon option with a 30mm internal width. Notably, this bike uses fat bike hub standards with a 150 x 15mm up front and 197 x 12mm out back. A 1×12 SRAM Apex Eagle drivetrain propels the rider while the (most likely long) crankset is TBA. While the seat post is a standard 31.6mm affair, the seat post clamp is an extra burly twin bolt design to keep the post from slipping under large riders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $5,899 (30% off if you become a VIP member for $4,129)</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Frame: DirtySixer 6061 or titanium available in XL, 2XL, 3XL (should fit riders from 5’10” to 6’8″)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fork: carbon fiber 150mm OLD x 15mm with triple eyelets</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rims: DirtySixer double-wall alloy 35mm internal / 42mm outer width or carbon fiber 30mm internal / 38mm outer width</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hubs: DirtySixer 36H in 150mm x 15mm front and 197mm x 12mm rear</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tires: DirtySixer VeeTire T-Monster 32″ (686 BSD) x 2.40 skin wall</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Handlebars: Ritchey Comp Beacon XL</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Headset: Neco</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Crankset: TBA</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pedals: DirtySixer oversized flat</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cassette: SRAM Apex Eagle PG1230 – 10-50 x 12-speed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Derailleur: SRAM Apex Eagle</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Brakes: 200mm rotors and hydraulic calipers</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shifter: SRAM Apex Eagle</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Seatpost: 31.6mm zero setback</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stem: 50mm + 30°</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-seat-cluster-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-seat-cluster-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"DirtySixer 32er Gravel bike seat cluster\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-seat-cluster-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-seat-cluster-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-seat-cluster-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-seat-cluster-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-seat-cluster-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-seat-cluster-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-rear-dropout-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-rear-dropout-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"DirtySixer 32er Gravel bike rear dropout\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-rear-dropout-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-rear-dropout-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-rear-dropout-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-rear-dropout-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-rear-dropout-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-rear-dropout-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Crowdfunding Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DirtySixer will soon launch a crowdfunding campaign for the 32er. Currently, you can land ‘VIP membership’ with a non-refundable $100 deposit. That gains you access to the VIP price when the crowdfunding campaign starts, which should work out to 30% off. We’re told that the preorder window will close in December. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Campaign timeline: </h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>October / November: Testing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>December / January: Finalizing geometry and components </li>\n\n\n\n<li>March / April: Production</li>\n\n\n\n<li>June: Delivery</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>DirtySixer says that some things, like drivetrain and brakes, may change once the feedback returns from testers. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-rear-dropouts-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-rear-dropouts-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"DirtySixer 32er Gravel bike rear dropouts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-rear-dropouts-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-rear-dropouts-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-rear-dropouts-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-rear-dropouts-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-rear-dropouts-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-rear-dropouts-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-32er-tires-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-32er-tires-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"DirtySixer 32er Gravel bike 32er tires\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-32er-tires-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-32er-tires-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-32er-tires-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-32er-tires-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-32er-tires-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DirtySixer-32er-Gravel-bike-32er-tires-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other Big Bikes in the Works</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>David also tells us that there are some mountain bikes in the works, starting with a hardtail 32er. That will likely be followed by a full suspension MTB that’s in development with “one of the biggest names in the rear suspension world.” On top of that, there are loose plans to offer 32″ wheel sets which could be an alternative build for existing 29+ or fat bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out more details on how to get your own DirtySixer 32er Gravel bike by hitting the link below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.dirtysixer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DirtySixer.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/dirtysixer-32er-gravel-bike-preorder/\">DirtySixer’s New 32er Gravel Bike Rolls on 32 x 2.4″ Tires, Preorder Ends Soon</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"e2ad3700ee53c729b4e50f5992279464ef9837c89ff7090b65f76b85ffaa4285","category":"Cycling"}
