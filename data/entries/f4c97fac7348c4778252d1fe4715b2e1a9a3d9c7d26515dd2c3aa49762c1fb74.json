{"title":"Vision Pro’s Battery Indicator Is Confusing","link":"https://support.apple.com/en-us/117740","date":1709763316000,"content":"\n<p>Apple, in a support document on charging Vision Pro:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The light next to the battery’s USB-C port can give you a quick look at the battery’s current charge state when you’re not wearing Apple Vision Pro. The light turns on briefly when you connect the battery to the USB-C Charge Cable, when you disconnect it, and when you move or gently tap it.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s what the light means when you first connect the battery to power, or if you move or tap the battery while it’s charging:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Green for several seconds: the battery is charged to capacity.</li>\n<li>Amber for several seconds: the battery’s charge level is less than 100%, but has enough charge for you to use Apple Vision Pro.</li>\n<li>Amber pulsing slowly: the battery’s charge level is too low to power your Apple Vision Pro. Keep charging the battery for 10 minutes, or until the light shows amber steadily (not pulsing) when you tap the battery.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here’s what the light means when you disconnect the battery from power, or if you move or tap the battery while it’s not connected to power:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Green for several seconds: the battery is charged to 50% or higher.</li>\n<li>Amber for several seconds: the battery’s charge level is between 5% and 49%.</li>\n<li>Amber pulsing slowly: the battery’s charge level is too low to power your Apple Vision Pro. Charge the battery for 10 minutes, or until the light shows amber steadily (not pulsing) when you tap the battery.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems like it could and should have been so much simpler. Why not have 4 lights instead of one, representing 25/50/75/100 percent charge levels? It seems like madness that green means “charged to capacity” when plugged in, but “50% or higher” when not. That’s a big difference!</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/06/vision-pro-battery-indicator\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f4c97fac7348c4778252d1fe4715b2e1a9a3d9c7d26515dd2c3aa49762c1fb74","category":"Tech"}
