However, there are some details in the fine print to be aware of.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFirst, Apple said it compared a new 2025 MacBook Air with a 10-core M4 chip and 32GB of RAM to a 2020 MacBook Air with a quad-core Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB of RAM. Both of the MacBook Air models were configured with a 2TB SSD. These are the best specifications that are or were available for each of these MacBook Air models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/MacBook-Air-23x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" />\r<br />\nSecond, Apple said its test consisted of using the Super Resolution feature on a 4.4MB image in image editing app Pixelmator Pro — which it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-completes-pixelmator-acquisition/\">now owns</a>. The feature uses machine learning to increase the resolution of images, while preserving sharpness and details.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo, the up to 23x faster performance claim is tied to quite a specific task.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is what Apple's fine print says in full:<blockquote>Testing conducted by Apple in January 2025 using preproduction 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air systems with Apple M4, 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, and 32GB of RAM, as well as production 1.2GHz quad-core Intel Core i7-based MacBook Air systems with Intel Iris Plus Graphics and 16GB of RAM, all configured with 2TB SSD. Tested using Super Resolution with Pixelmator Pro 3.6.14 and a 4.4MB image. Performance tests are conducted using specific computer systems and reflect the approximate performance of MacBook Air.</blockquote>What about other tasks? Apple provided some more comparisons:<blockquote>- Spreadsheet calculation performance in Microsoft Excel is up to 4.7x faster than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Air, and up to 1.6x faster than the 13-inch MacBook Air with M1.\r<br />\n- Video editing in iMovie is up to 8x faster than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Air, and up to 2x faster than the 13-inch MacBook Air with M1.\r<br />\n- Photo editing in Adobe Photoshop is up to 3.6x faster than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Air, and up to 2x faster than the 13-inch MacBook Air with M1.\r<br />\n- Web browsing is up to 60 percent faster when compared to a PC laptop with an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, and more demanding tasks get up to 2x faster performance.</blockquote>Those claims seem more realistic for most users.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUltimately, while the 23x claim might be overselling things a bit, it is true that any MacBook Air with an M1 chip or newer is dramatically faster than any Intel-based model. If you have been holding off on upgrading, you are in for a treat.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can pre-order the new MacBook Air now on Apple's online store, and it will begin arriving to customers on Wednesday, March 12.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/m4-macbook-air-up-to-23x-faster-vs-intel/\">Apple Says New MacBook Air Up to 23x Faster Than Intel-Based Model, But Read the Fine Print</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-new-macbook-air-up-to-23x-faster-than-intel-based-model-but-read-the-fine-print.2452243/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5419c712bfbe19fd14259b34667badf1089aa81677eeea5a513447317f3789de","category":"Apple"}
