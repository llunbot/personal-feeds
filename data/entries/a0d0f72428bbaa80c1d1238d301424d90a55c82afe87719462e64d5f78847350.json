Even within those limitations, however, there have been regular claims that the hardware can perform in ways that are impossible to match with classical computation (one of the more recent examples coming <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/google-identifies-low-noise-phase-transition-in-its-quantum-processor/\">just last year</a>). In most cases to date, however, those claims were quickly followed by some tuning and optimization of classical algorithms that boosted their performance, making them competitive once again.</p>\n<p>Today, we have a new entry into the claims departmentâ€”or rather a new claim by an old entry. D-Wave is a company that makes quantum annealers, specialized hardware that is most effective when applied to a class of optimization problems. The new work shows that the hardware can track the behavior of a quantum system called an Ising model far more efficiently than any of the current state-of-the-art classical algorithms.</p>\n<p>Knowing what will likely come next, however, the team behind the work writes, \"We hope and expect that our results will inspire novel numerical techniques for quantum simulation.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/d-wave-quantum-annealers-solve-problems-classical-algorithms-struggle-with/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/d-wave-quantum-annealers-solve-problems-classical-algorithms-struggle-with/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a0d0f72428bbaa80c1d1238d301424d90a55c82afe87719462e64d5f78847350","category":"Tech"}
