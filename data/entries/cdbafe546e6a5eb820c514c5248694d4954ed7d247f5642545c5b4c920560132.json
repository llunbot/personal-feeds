On day three, Perplexity Chief Business Officer Dmitry Shevelenko told the court that Google blocked <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/\">Perplexity</a> from being bundled with Motorola phones, which is precisely the kind of anticompetitive behavior that got it in hot water. It would appear Google is backing away, though, because Perplexity is included with Moto's newly announced flip phones.</p>\n<p>During questioning on Wednesday, Shevelenko likened Google's mobile integration contracts to a \"gun to your head.\" He claimed that both Motorola and Perplexity, which positions itself as an AI search engine, were interested in a partnership last year, but the phone maker was unable to get out of its Google distribution contract, which prevented it from using a non-Google assistant platform.</p>\n<p>Google has long required Android device makers to use Assistant on their devices, but Google's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/google-launches-gemini-a-powerful-ai-model-it-says-can-surpass-gpt-4/\">launch of Gemini</a> added a sense of urgency. Google is pushing Gemini into every corner of its ecosystem with the aim of catching up to ChatGPT, and it <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/gemini-usage-is-exploding-but-google-is-a-long-way-from-catching-chatgpt/\">might be working</a>. Motorola's 2024 phones were some of the first to prominently feature Gemini as the default assistant instead of Google Assistant. Apparently, that left no room for Perplexity as OEMs are unwilling to risk their Google revenue-sharing agreements.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/perplexity-will-come-to-moto-phones-after-exec-testified-google-blocked-access/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/perplexity-will-come-to-moto-phones-after-exec-testified-google-blocked-access/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cdbafe546e6a5eb820c514c5248694d4954ed7d247f5642545c5b4c920560132","category":"Tech"}
