Some go out with a bang, others with a whimper.</p>\n<p>They can die by accident if theyâ€™re injured or infected. Alternatively, should they outlive their natural lifespan or start to fail, they can carefully arrange for a desirable demise, with their remains neatly tidied away.</p>\n<p>Originally, scientists thought those were the only two ways an animal cell could die, by accident or by that neat-and-tidy version. But over the past couple of decades, researchers have<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41418-017-0012-4\"> racked up many more novel cellular death</a> scenarios, some specific to certain cell types or situations. Understanding this panoply of death modes could help scientists save good cells and kill bad ones, leading to treatments for infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053130#p3\">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053130&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Knowable Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fb120b20137baf095f573dfba7f1e90d2b27bab8711b2d02297936f255e6898f","category":"Tech"}
