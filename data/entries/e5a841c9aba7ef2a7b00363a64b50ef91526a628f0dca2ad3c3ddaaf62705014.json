And if you’re searching for proof, you need only look as far as the homegrown stars who have put their hands in the air aboard the Italian manufacturer’s race-winning machines. Just in the past 10 years Froome, Bernal, Thomas, Cavendish, Wiggins, Pidcock, Geoghegan Hart… </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pinarello F series shares its DNA with the Italian brand’s Grand Tour-winning models – only now, this peerless performance is more accessible to the discerning road rider, regardless of whether you’re pinning on a number. Each of the F series models is a thoroughbred race bike, with competition-focussed geometry, unrivalled handling, incomparable aerodynamic design and attention to detail delivering gains for the most demanding riders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>30 Grand Tour victories over 70 years in the pro peloton doesn’t happen by chance, and the introduction of the F series looks set to ignite an explosion in the number of riders who can access true Italian cycling heritage and taste their own sweet victory – whether that’s racing or simply smashing a KOM on a Sunday ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Heritage counts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pinarello bikes have been at the front of the pack – and admired in photos on bedroom walls – for decades. The brand’s game-changing designs and mould-shattering concepts have helped propel the world of cycling into the modern era with the use of aerospace technology. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the first Pinarello Grand Tour victory at the 1975 Giro d’Italia to the Grand Tour domination, Olympic and World Championship TT victories and Hour Record of Miguel Indurain in the 1990s, through the dominant displays from Jan Ulrich and later the peerless performance of Team Sky and Ineos Grenadiers, the Italian brand has been on the top step every step of the way. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-02-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"Pinarello F-Series\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-02-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-02-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-02-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-02-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Pinarello</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Over the years, Pinarello has won the Tour de France with not only carbon bikes but also steel, aluminium and even magnesium machines. The F series injects this race-winning pedigree into a bike that’s accessible to a wider range of riders, delivering the mouthwatering prospect of world-beating tech and performance in a package that won’t cost the Earth.    </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Maximise your advantage</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pinarello wouldn’t have become a Grand Tour winner without a bike that excelled in all areas. And that heritage lives on in the F series. Maximum speed is extracted thanks to its wind-tunnel development, benefitting from advanced computational fluid dynamics systems to maximise its aerodynamic advantage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the Pinarello F series excels when it comes to the smaller details too. An integrated seatpost clamp reduces the overall size of the seat tube for better integration, reduced weight and improved aerodynamic performance, while the electronic groupset battery is secreted inside the bottom bracket. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-01-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Pinarello F-series\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-01-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-01-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-01-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-01-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-01-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-01-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-01.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Pinarello</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Besides lowering the centre of gravity for more assured handling, this gave the design team freedom to optimise the seatpost shape for improved aerodynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reach new heights</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pinarello F series is lightweight without compromise, allowing you to power to the loftiest peak with minimal losses thanks to its svelte T900/T700 carbon fibre frame which is not only light, but also reactive and supremely damped from road shocks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pinarello has been at the cutting edge of innovation for decades, and the F series’ frame design makes use of that expertise to ensure no watt of power is wasted. The F series employs a unique asymmetrical design for its chainstays and seatstays, recognising the imbalance of forces going through a frame when riding thanks to the torsional force from the chain. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Pinarello F-series\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Pinarello</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>This not only enhances your riding but also means you can give everything you’ve got in the confidence that each pedal stroke results in seamless forward motion, whatever the gradient.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Be more ‘Pidcock’</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While its light weight means punishing, short ascents are dispatched with ease, where the F series shines equally brightly is in its prowess in descending and carving through corners. Agile handling and pin-perfect cornering aplomb are the result of geometry that has been fine-tuned in the world’s toughest road races.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Onda carbon fork – a trademark of Pinarello frames since 2000 – is shaped to deliver precise turning and stability, as well as to reduce longitudinal and lateral shocks. This is the result of extensive research and development, Pinarello’s deep understanding of aerodynamics and how the latest materials perform at the limit. It’s the result of the brand’s willingness to rip up the rulebook and redefine what a bike can be. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Pinarello F-series\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-new-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Pinarello</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>And to power round corners in confidence, the Pinarello design team have accommodated clearance for high-volume 30mm tyres, for a greater contact patch and increased ride comfort, while still retaining a compact rear frame triangle for fast and responsive inputs of speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Crunching the numbers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pinarello F series is currently available in the UK in two models – the F5 and F7 – with spec options ranging from the UD T700-framed, Shimano 105 Di2-equipped F5 to the T900 layup of the F7, which is fitted with a Shimano Ultegra Di2 groupset. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-06-970x250.jpg\" alt=\"Pinarello F-Series\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-06-970x250.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-06-300x77.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-06-768x198.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-06-750x193.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-06-1140x294.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/pinarello-f-series-sponsored-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Pinarello</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Take your pick between blue or grey for the F5, and from red/black and the stealthy ‘razor’ black for the F7. An additional Dura-Ace-equipped model, the F9, featuring the same T900 layup as the F7, is available globally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And once you’ve decided which model best suits your demands, and your means, there are nine frame size options for each model – more than any other competitor – which means the Pinarello F series is not only the perfect weapon to take your performance to the next level, but it’s also practically made to measure.
