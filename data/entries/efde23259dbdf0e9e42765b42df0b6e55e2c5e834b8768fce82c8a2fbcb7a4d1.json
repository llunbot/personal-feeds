Now, if someone in the group misses the call when the phone rings, they can still join whenever they like. You can also drop-off and re-join the call so long as it's still ongoing.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhatsApp says the new feature serves to \"reduce the burden of answering a group call as it starts, and brings the spontaneity and ease of in-person conversations to group calling on WhatsApp.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to joinable calls, WhatsApp has got a new call info screen so you can see who is already on the call, and who has been invited but not yet joined. There's also a new \"Ignore\" option in the calls tab if you want to join a call later.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nJoinable calls is rolling out now globally. Note that only eight participants can be active on a WhatsApp call at one time.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/\">WhatsApp</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/whatsapp-announces-joinable-calls/\">WhatsApp Now Lets You Join Group Calls Even After They've Started</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-now-lets-you-join-group-calls-even-after-theyve-started.2304824/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zb7bc_y2SNo:3bL4Llir11M:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zb7bc_y2SNo:3bL4Llir11M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/zb7bc_y2SNo\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"efde23259dbdf0e9e42765b42df0b6e55e2c5e834b8768fce82c8a2fbcb7a4d1","category":"Apple"}
