{"title":"Vinegar — Safari Extension That Replaces YouTube Embeds With Simple HTML 5 Video Tags","link":"https://andadinosaur.com/launch-vinegar","date":1638039075000,"content":"\n<p>Zhenyi Tan:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.verticalforest.com/youtube5-extension/\">YouTube5</a> was a Safari extension back when Flash was still a thing and hated by everyone. It replaced the YouTube player (written in Flash) with an HTML <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag.</p>\n\n<p>And now the YouTube player situation has gotten bad enough that we need another extension to fix it. That’s where Vinegar comes in. Vinegar also replaces the YouTube player (written in who-knows-what) with a minimal HTML <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ve been using Vinegar for over a week now, across all my devices — iPhone, iPad, Mac — and I’m already at the place where I don’t know what I’d do without it. Crackerjack good work. <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vinegar-tube-cleaner/id1591303229\">$2 on the App Store</a>. Just buy it, trust me.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/27/vinegar\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1fac23963eb5d824a74a39d0f5b76e576582ac68fc340162fe3dd8d63705c88c","category":"Tech"}
