Thankfully, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09N3PRJZK\">Baseus Blade Laptop Power Bank is on sale for $54 at Amazon</a> right now, down from its usual $130, so make sure you add this one to your cart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This slim 20,000mAh battery pack is ideal for charging laptops, including your favorite MacBook, iPhones, and iPads. I personally have the second edition and wish I’d have this version instead. While this model is only a bit thicker than the second version, it has a lot more power, which is essential when charging laptops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, even though this is a thicker model, it’s still slim at just 0.7 inches, making it super easy to slip into your bag next to your laptop or iPad. It also weighs just a little over a pound, so you don’t make your backpack too heavy if you add this one next to all the other things you carry. The power bank features a small digital display where you’ll be able to see how much battery is still left, the voltage used to charge whatever you’ve plugged in, and the time left until the charge (or recharge) is complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the Baseus Blade supports fast charging, your devices will get their batteries filled up in no time. There are 2 PD USB-C ports you can use, supporting 100W and 65W charging, and two fast-charging USB-A ports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take advantage of this total bargain and get yourself this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09N3PRJZK\">Baseus Blade laptop power bank for a mere $54</a> while you still can.</p>\n\n\n<span>The Baseus Blade comes with a serious 60% discount</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09N3PRJZK\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d12dee54319c9721dbf91b2dcff90c275397a2b420027b625a5a56ac8a9a159a","category":"Apple"}
