In a social media post, Joswiak said to \"Mac your calendars\" because there's an exciting week of announcements that start on Monday morning.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/apple-oct-2024-mac-tease.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nWith Joswiak's announcement, it appears that there will not be a dedicated October event for Macs this year, with Apple instead introducing new products via press release. Monday will see the launch of the iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 software updates, but new Mac announcements could also start on Monday. In prior years, Apple has done a launch-per-day release schedule for new products when there wasn't an event planned. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Mac () your calendars!

We are expecting new models of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, and ‌MacBook Pro‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iMac‌, entry-level ‌Mac mini‌, and entry-level ‌MacBook Pro‌ will all include the M4 chip, which we actually already got earlier this year in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models. Higher-end ‌MacBook Pro‌ models will use M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, while the ‌Mac mini‌ will also get the M4 Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe aren't expecting design changes for the ‌iMac‌ or ‌MacBook Pro‌, but the ‌Mac mini‌ is rumored to be smaller, closer in size to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>. With the decrease in size, it could be a bit thicker. For all entry-level models, rumors suggest RAM is going to start at 16GB instead of 8GB, providing better performance for Apple Intelligence features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhatever comes next week, we'll have full coverage of the new announcements at MacRumors.com.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/24/apple-m4-announcements-next-week/\">Apple Teases M4 Mac Announcements Next Week</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-teases-m4-mac-announcements-next-week.2440869/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"065c70c010443ce5affab70d5a5b9df77d0cd945c3b045cddae38ceab3a4024e","category":"Apple"}
