While a launch is not imminent this week, it could take place as early as April 10, sources said.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, the company lifted the massive \"Super Heavy\" first stage of its launch system onto a launch mount at the pad. The next step will involve lifting the Starship upper stage into place, atop the first stage. While these vehicles have been previously stacked for testing, this should be the final time they are positioned on the launch pad before lifting off.</p>\n<p>In recent weeks technicians have added shielding to protect the launch mount and tower from the extreme heating from the launch of Super Heavy, which is powered by 33 Raptor engines. The launch vehicle will have about double the thrust of the two most powerful rockets ever to reach orbit, NASA's Saturn V and Space Launch System rockets.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928548#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928548&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0d0cb91471051c7235521626516f0615f96bbd19833e35850b772014471ed328","category":"Tech"}
