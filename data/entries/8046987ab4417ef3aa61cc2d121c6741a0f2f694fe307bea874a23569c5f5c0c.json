These Apps Will Hide It for You","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/27/macbook-pro-hide-notch-apps/","date":1635332089000,"content":"If you bought a new MacBook Pro and find yourself having a hard time acclimatizing to the notch at the top of the screen in the middle of the menu bar, there's an app for that.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/macbook-pro-2021-notch-feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe inclusion of a display notch on the redesigned MacBook Pros was a surprise to most observers and was one of the few last-minute rumors that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/15/new-macbook-pro-could-have-a-notch/\">surfaced</a> ahead of their unveiling. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSome have since criticized Apple's design choice of adding a notch, but Apple has pushed back against criticism by saying that it's a \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/24/xapple-executive-interview-on-macbook-pro-notch/\">smart way</a>\" of giving users more room for their content, because it allowed the bezels to be made thinner for added screen real estate. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf that logic doesn't pass your scrutiny, the following apps are available. While they don't outright cancel the notch, they at least make its existence less obvious by forcing a black menu bar, similar to how macOS Monterey adds a black black bezel to the top of the display <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/macos-hides-notch-on-new-macbook-pros/\">when apps are in fullscreen mode</a>, but by adapting your chosen wallpaper instead, like so.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/remove-notch-app.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/nASbe\">Forehead</a> (free): </strong>Besides letting you switch between your default wallpaper and a black notchless one, Forehead includes options to round the corners of the screen, similar to the rounded top corners of the new MacBook Pros. The ability to simulate a notch on older Macs is coming in an update. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://topnotch.app\">TopNotch</a> (free):</strong> Offers the same features as Forehead, and also supports Dynamic Wallpapers, works with multiple displays and spaces, and remains in the background and detects for wallpaper changes. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.publicspace.net/Denotchifier/index.html\">De-Notch-ifier</a> (â‚¬9.95):</strong> Offers the same features as TopNotch, just in the form of a dropdown menu in the menu bar. De-Notch-ifier isn't a completely new app, rather it's a pre-configured version of Boring Old Menu Bar that gives you a boring old non-transparent menu bar on macOS Big Sur and later. If you buy one app, you get the other for free. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOwn a new MacBook Pro? What do you think of the notch now that you've spent some time with it?
