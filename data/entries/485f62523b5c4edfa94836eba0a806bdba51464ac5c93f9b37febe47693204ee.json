If adopted, the new rules would go into effect for model years 2027–2032 and would be the strictest fuel economy regulations yet seen in the United States, cutting fleet carbon emissions for light-duty vehicles by 56 percent from 2026 levels.</p>\n<p>The new regulations would also bring in tougher standards for other airborne pollutants emitted by the internal combustion engines in those light-duty vehicles. Additionally, the EPA proposes tougher new rules on medium-duty (class 2b and class 3) vehicles—mostly large pickup trucks and vans with a gross vehicle weight rating of 8,501–14,000 lbs. The EPA is also looking to modify some credit programs and wants new durability and warranty standards for the battery packs in battery electric vehicles.</p>\n<p>The EPA thinks that two-thirds of new car sales will be electric within the next decade if the rules are adopted, as they require automakers to sell many more BEVs.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931069#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931069&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
