One of the most frequent requests has been for a mobile app — for listening to Audio Overviews on the go, asking questions about sources in the moment, and sharing content directly to NotebookLM while browsing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nToday, we're happy to say it's here, on both Android and iOS! This first version of the app includes many of the core features of NotebookLM — with more refinements and features to come in the months ahead — and is designed to help you understand anything, anywhere.</blockquote>If you haven't come across it before, <a href=\"https://notebooklm.google.com\">NotebookLM</a> functions as an AI research companion that helps users analyze and interact with their documents, websites, and other content. The tool can generate summaries, create FAQ lists, produce timeline views, and even transform research materials into podcast-style audio discussions with AI-generated hosts. Google originally launched it in 2023, and then launched its <a href=\"https://support.google.com/notebooklm/answer/15678219?hl=en\">NotebookLM Plus plan</a> for businesses, schools, organizations, and enterprise customers in December. NotebookLM Plus is also available as a part of a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/notebooklm-plus-now-available-in-google-one/\">Google One AI Premium subscription</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOne of the big additions with the app is offline access to Audio Overviews, the genuinely impressive feature that sees two hosts have a podcast-style chat about your project sources. Users can now download summaries for listening on the go, which should be handy for those looking to conserve data. Whether offline or online, the app also supports background playback, making it easier to catch up on research insights while multitasking.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe iOS version also adds more interactivity. Users can tap \"Join\" to engage directly with the app's AI-powered hosts, allowing them to ask clarifying questions, change the direction of a summary, or toss in an offbeat query. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nSharing content into NotebookLM is now easier than it was via the web app. If you're viewing a website, a PDF, or a YouTube video, access the share sheet and select NotebookLM to add the material as a source. Google says it plans to expand the range of supported input types over time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe NotebookLM app is now available on the App Store for iPhone and iPad.
