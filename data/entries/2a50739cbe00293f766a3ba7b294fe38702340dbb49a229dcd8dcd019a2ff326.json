According to the collector of rare Apple products, prototype information they obtained indicates that Apple intended to release its current MagSafe charger in a \"colored version,\" similar to the MagSafe Charging 3 Charging cables it makes for the MacBook Air.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple includes a color-matched MagSafe 3 charging cable in the box with the MacBook Air, but also makes them <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/06/apple-to-sell-magsafe-3-cable-in-colors/\">available to purchase separately</a> in the four MacBook Air colors: Space Gray,  Silver, Midnight, and Starlight.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to @KosutamiSan, Apple's prototyped colored MagSafe Charger for iPhone has more color saturation than the MagSafe power cables. The collector shared the above picture of a Starlight-colored MagSafe puck as an example, while also claiming that Apple has prototyped similar colored versions for the unreleased horizontal stand-based model called \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/14/collectors-discover-unreleased-apple-accessory/\">Magic Charger.</a>\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's not clear whether the prototyped colored chargers were designed to match with unreleased iPhone colors but were never mass produced. It's likewise unknown if Apple intends to launch colored versions in the future, but the prototyping tidbit is interesting nonetheless, and there is a chance that Apple could release more varieties of its MagSafe charger to compete with rivals in the new Qi2 market that is set to coalesce later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/magic-charger-prototype-kosutamisam.jpeg\" alt width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" /><div><em>\"Magic Charger\" MagSafe prototype (Image: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KyoukoMizumi/status/1590955702599974912?s=20\">@KosutamiSan</a>) </em></div>\r<br />\nApple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/03/qi2-wireless-charging-standard-gains-magsafe/\">contributing</a> to the new version of the Qi open standard and it will work much like MagSafe. As a result, Apple's upcoming iPhone 15 models are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/24/iphone-15-15w-wireless-fast-charging-non-certified/\">expected to support 15W wireless fast charging</a> even when using third-party chargers that are not Apple-certified, removing a key hurdle for third-party wireless chargers to compete with the company's MagSafe accessory. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<small><em>Article updated to include additional Magic Charger details.</em></small><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/29/apple-magsafe-charger-more-colors/\">Apple Prototyped MagSafe iPhone Chargers in Different Colors, Including Unreleased 'Magic Charger' Stand</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-prototyped-magsafe-iphone-chargers-in-different-colors-including-unreleased-magic-charger-stand.2390778/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2a50739cbe00293f766a3ba7b294fe38702340dbb49a229dcd8dcd019a2ff326","category":"Apple"}
