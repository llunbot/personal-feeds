In a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1541p7x/lets_talk_about_it_more_ways_to_connect_live_with/)\">post</a> on Wednesday, a Reddit employee detailed outreach efforts from the company, including new weekly feedback sessions, that it hopes can help repair ties with the social media platform and over 50,000 volunteer mods that it relies on.

The company has also offered contentious <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23762868/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-interview\">interviews</a> with CEO Steve Huffman. Reddit also reportedly forced some subreddits that moderators labeled \"not safe for work\" as a form of protest (claiming to have taken member polls beforehand) to revert back to \"safe for work\" and threatened to forcibly reopen subreddits that had gone private in protest.</p>\n<p>\"So, we’ve all had a... time on Reddit lately,\" Go_JasonWaterfalls wrote. \"And I’m here to recognize it, acknowledge that our relationship has been tested, and begin the 'now what?' conversation.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955306#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955306&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e882356157db3b246d9983e590800ff65da5fcf7b2bfc29ee98787e4112c9349","category":"Tech"}
