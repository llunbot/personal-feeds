More a jagged line than a circle, the chain connects the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/col-d-aubisque-tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Col d’Aubisque</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/col-du-soulor-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Col du Soulor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/classic-tour-de-france-climbs-col-du-tourmalet\" target=\"_blank\">Col du Tourmalet</a>, Col d’Aspin and Col de Peyresourde, running through the heart of the French Pyrenees. It totals over 5,000m of climbing and a version of this route has featured in the Tour de France an incredible 45 times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To a great extent, the creation of this five-piece was geographically determined – the Pyrenees is a narrow mountain range and if you want to go over the high points, as opposed to around them, this is the only way. Indeed, the Col du Tourmalet will make its 90th appearance in the Tour de France this summer, explaining its nickname of ‘<em>L’incontournable</em>’, the unavoidable. The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France Femmes</a> and Vuelta a España will both visit too.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bordering-on-the-insane-west-pyrenees-big-ride\">Bordering on the insane: West Pyrenees Big Ride</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/rise-of-the-giant-paying-homage-to-a-tour-legend-on-the-col-du-tourmalet\">Rise of the giant: Paying homage to a Tour legend on the Col du Tourmalet</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 142: on sale now!</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>The Tour debuted this mighty combination in 1910 on the first ever high-mountain stage, running the other way, before the entire <em>Grand Boucle</em> reversed direction from 1913. As the race began to modernise in 1930 and leave behind its ultra-endurance origins, stage distances were reduced and routes varied more often. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Circle of Death\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Semi-wild horses live around the summit of Aubisque for most of the year.</figcaption><figcaption>Chris Storrar</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Circle of Death, however, continued to appear in its entirety and was the scene of some iconic performances, including solo, Tour-winning raids by Jean Robic in 1947 and Eddy Merckx in 1969 – the former a come-from-behind GC flip, the latter an emphatic stamp of authority on a race already gripped by the jugular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forty years ago this summer, another historic moment took place on these roads. A young Scottish rider, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pippa-york\" target=\"_blank\">Pippa York</a> (then known as Robert Millar), on her Tour debut, joined a powerful breakaway group of GC riders and climbers. As it was whittled down over the successive climbs, she remained near the front. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Circle of Death\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>From the west, the Circle of Death kicks off with the 16km Col d’Aubisque, which is as pretty as it is tough.</figcaption><figcaption>Chris Storrar</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>On the Col de Peyresourde she attacked near the summit, bombed the descent and in Bagnères-de-Luchon took the first Tour stage win by a British rider against GC opposition.

But our ride today is the original, the template – the Circle of Death in its purest, most brutal form.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Let the games begin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our route starts on the outskirts of Pau. Under normal circumstances, the pro peloton would roll out from the handsome city centre, but today it is too busy with morning rush hour traffic, so instead our <em>Grand Départ</em> is from a petrol station forecourt at a junction of the ring road and main route south.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Circle of Death\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Some of the buildings tip over from ‘vintage charm’ into ‘old and shabby’.</figcaption><figcaption>Chris Storrar</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There’s no cheering crowd or commissaires’ cars, and Tadej Pogačar is a no-show, but I am joined by a good friend, Dave Janes, who is a beast on a bike and was my regular training partner before I moved to France. He’s about the only person I know who would jump at the chance to take on a challenge like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drizzle in Pau necessitates rolling out in jackets but we have faith in the forecast. We’re quickly onto a smaller road that winds through and over the Pyrenees’ thin smear of foothills and into the mountains proper. We’ve a long day ahead so we aim to keep the pace high, falling into step and swapping long turns as if we’d been riding together only last week, not last year.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-05-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Circle of Death\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-05-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-05-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-05-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-05-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-05-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The ski station of Gourette provides the stunning backdrop as we enter the final 3km of the Aubisque.</figcaption><figcaption>Chris Storrar</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ominous clouds are lingering over Laruns, where the Cols de Pourtalet and Aubisque begin. The former breaks for the border with Spain, the latter leads into the Circle of Death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no fiery gates, though. Rather the Aubisque begins gently, easing us into the day’s climbing and its own 1,190m of ascent. The gradient stiffens after the shabby spa town of Eaux Bonnes – it doesn’t look so <em>bon</em> these days – so we keep an eye on our power output to ensure we don’t burn too many matches too soon.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Circle of Death\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-06-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-06-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The day’s route profile makes for daunting viewing.</figcaption><figcaption>Chris Storrar</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>We climb in the dim light of heavy tree cover, emerging occasionally like a whale from the deep, before plunging back inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ski station of Gourrette brings a key change. From here, the road is wilder, as if it’s fighting a battle to cling to the side of the mountain, which in turn is doing its best to hurl it into the abyss, a bucking bronco in granite. The iconic hotel at 2km to go, usually visible from a great distance, only comes into view as we near it, but we can see across the valley to the slopes that are dark and brooding in the shadow of the clouds.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-07-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Circle of Death\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-07-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-07-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-07-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-07-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-07-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-07-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-07-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-07.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The weathered stone sign at the top of the Aubisque indicates the huge descent to the commune of Argeles-Gazost.</figcaption><figcaption>Chris Storrar</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The summit of the Aubisique is chilly and the usually sensational view is limited, so we pause only to don jackets and stuff in a rice cake to chew as we descend. As if by recompense, the famous balcony road around the Cirque du Litor is free from cloud and delivers the awe that was missing from the summit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wet road dictates caution though, lest we follow in the wheel tracks of Wim van Est, who plunged off the side in the 1951 Tour while in yellow and, having defied death, had to be rescued by his team using a rope made of spare tubular tyres. In the years since they have put up a plaque, but not a guardrail.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Little climb, big climb</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From this side, it’s only a short climb to the twin peak of Soulor.

To that end, we stomp along the valley, shedding layers and swapping turns, flying right past the village where I live before diving into the beautiful, steep-sided Gorge Luz.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To the right of the narrow, twisting road is the Gavarnie River, its energy contained by huge boulders like police at a protest.

A sign reminds us that we have 19km of climbing to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The road is wide and the gradient firm, toughening further either side of Barèges. It’s only at the ski station, halfway up, and the first switchbacks that we get two significant views. One is back down the climb, finally showing us how far we have come and how high we already are. If you’re suffering, it’s a double morale burger with cheese right when you need it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But just before you take a big, greedy bite, it gets snatched from your lips by the other view, that of the summit, a towering wall across the horizon, no longer abstract and somehow further away than ever because of it.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-10-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Circle of Death\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-10-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-10-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-10.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Inside the last 3km of the Col du Tourmalet, with the climb’s full scale laid out behind.</figcaption><figcaption>Chris Storrar</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>At the well-known hairpin where this new road, built in 2011, rejoins the old road, Dave and I stop and take a moment at a little cairn of rocks I made to commemorate a friend and teammate of ours, Fran Eddolls, who died of brain cancer in 2020 at just 28. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cairn contains a photo and enjoys a spectacular view across the valley over the climb, gravel roads and MTB park that Fran would have loved to ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We climb in silence for a while until a sharp increase in gradient at the 2km-to-go sign sparks lighter conversation once more.

The surface is smooth, it flows, and there are some sweeping bends that can be taken at high speed once you know them. It peters out at the bottom, serving as a post-stage turbo trainer cool-down for our adrenal glands and a warm-up for our legs. Both are useful because, after turning right at the base, the Col d’Aspin starts immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first 5km are easy until we reach the beautiful bowl at Lac de Payolle. From there, the road climbs more steeply, with a set of four big switchbacks slashed across the face of the hillside and through the evergreen forest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This late in the day, the usually busy car park at the summit of Aspin is empty, heightening the panoramic view that includes the Pic du Midi de Bigorre high above the Col du Tourmalet behind us and the Col de Peyresourde in the distance ahead. To the north, our left, a colder bank of cloud tumbles over the ridge, lemming-like, to be wiped from existence as it meets the warm air on this side.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-12-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Circle of Death\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-12-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-12-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-12-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-12-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-12-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-12-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-12-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-12.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>For sale, hotel, fantastic potential.</figcaption><figcaption>Chris Storrar</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Thanks to some excellent resurfacing three years ago, the descent of the Col d’Aspin to Arreau is fantastic.

The danger and difficulty leads the press to dub the route ‘The Circle of Death’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1936:</strong> Belgian Sylvère Maes crushes his opponents in a reverse version of <em>Cyclist</em>’s route on his way to winning the Tour by almost 27 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1947:</strong> Frenchman Jean Robic breaks away alone across the summits of the Circle of Death to win Stage 15 by ten minutes. He will win the Tour without ever wearing the leader’s yellow jersey. Two years later, when the stage direction is reversed, Robic will win again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1969:</strong> Eddy Merckx reigns supreme. At the start of Stage 17, Merckx has a comfortable lead on GC and just needs to stay with the pack, but instead drops all his rivals over the Tourmalet and rides solo for 130km to win the stage by 7min 56sec.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1983:</strong> Philippa York – then Robert Millar – gives Britain its first taste of high-mountain stage success on the Circle of Death, beating Pedro Delgado to the line by six seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1995:</strong> On a descent of the Portet d’Aspet, Italian Fabio Casartelli dies after crashing into a concrete barrier. The following day’s stage is neutralised and the peloton rides in procession.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2012:</strong> The last time the Circle of Death stage followed <em>Cyclist</em>’s ride. French favourite Thomas Voeckler wins the day, although Britain’s Bradley Wiggins holds onto his GC lead, which he will keep to Paris to secure Britain’s first Tour de France victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The rider’s ride</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>BMC Timemachine Road 01 Two, £8,199, <a href=\"https://zyrofisher.co.uk/brands/bmc/\" target=\"_blank\">zyrofisher.co.uk</a></em></p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-16-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Circle of Death\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-16-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-16-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-16-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-16-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-16-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-16-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-16-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-16.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Chris Storrar</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Timemachine Road 01 is BMC’s dedicated aero-road racer. While the high mountains are usually the preserve of its sibling, the Teammachine, this bike can still hold its own. Think of it as a GC contender in the Bradley Wiggins mould: you’ll buy it for its aero speed, but you’ll be happy to take it on big climbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep things aero, the bottle cages blend into the frame, and the space between them is filled to help with airflow and also provides a handy storage compartment. Naturally, all the cables are hidden, and the cockpit and tube shapes are wind-tunnel-optimised to prevent the air being such a drag.  All this focus on aerodynamics hasn’t come at too much of a weight penalty. At 7.88kg the bike is light enough to climb well (although I reckon they could save some weight from the name) and the ride is good in most ways, even if it isn’t the most precise descender. In general, it looks like a rocket and rides like one too. And thanks to Favero for the Assioma Duo pedals that supplied my power data.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we did it</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-15-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Circle of Death\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-15-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-15-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-15-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-15-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-15-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-15-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-15-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/big-ride-141-circle-of-death-15.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>This road, in this light, with this view, is the stuff cycling dreams are made of.</figcaption><figcaption>Chris Storrar</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Travel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pyrenees are easily accessible with direct flights to Lourdes. There are also airports in Pau and Toulouse. To skip air travel altogether, take the ferry from Portsmouth to St Malo and drive for around eight hours, or catch the 24-hour ferry from Portsmouth to Santander in Spain, and then drive four hours to Pau.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Accommodation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gratuitous plug alert! It just so happens that my guesthouse is right in the middle of the route. It’s set up for cyclists and we offer fully catered stays, with homemade ride snacks, GPX routes, a fully equipped garage, comfortable rooms and delicious meals. Ride self-guided or join one of our guided and supported tours. If you would like to take on the Circle of Death yourself, we can recreate this exact ride, including transfers and support car.
