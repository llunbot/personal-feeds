Google and the federal government have announced an agreement that makes Google Workspace available to all agencies at a significant discount, trimming 71 percent from the service's subscription price tag.</p>\n<p>Since Donald Trump returned to the White House, the government has engaged in a campaign of unbridled staffing reductions and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/despite-court-orders-climate-and-energy-programs-stalled-by-trump-freeze/\">program cancellations</a>, all with the alleged aim of reducing federal spending. It would appear Google recognized this opportunity, negotiating with the General Services Administration (GSA) to offer Workspace at a lower price. Google claims the deal could yield up to $2 billion in savings.</p>\n<p>Google has previously offered discounts for federal agencies interested in migrating to Workspace, but it saw little success displacing Microsoft.
