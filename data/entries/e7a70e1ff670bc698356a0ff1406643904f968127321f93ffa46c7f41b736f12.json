It has a massive effect on the overall performance, aesthetics and ergonomics of a bike and has always been a focal point for innovation and change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While a bike’s nominal brand (ie, the one printed on the frame) is responsible for the design of the frame and the choice of components that make up the build, groupsets are designed and manufactured by dedicated component brands, with the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-road-bike\" target=\"_blank\">road bike</a> market dominated by Shimano, SRAM and Campagnolo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes one groupset different from another may not only be the sheer number of gears, but also how the user operates those gears, what brakes are included and, last but not least, the price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’re shopping for a bike, the choice of groupset will be an important consideration and one of the main points of comparison between different models.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which are the main groupset brands?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano, SRAM and Campagnolo are the three big names for road and gravel bike groupsets and, despite other concerted efforts, it’s unlikely they’ll be knocked off the podium any time soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With their latest ranges, all have committed to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-cyclist-guide-to-road-bike-disc-brakes\">disc brake</a> groupsets at the top-end, as well as electronic shifting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With SRAM ostensibly leading the way with its fully wireless <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/campagnolo-super-record-wireless-groupset\" target=\"_blank\">12-speed eTap AXS groupsets</a>, Shimano made steps in the same direction with the release of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/shimano-105-di2\" target=\"_blank\">semi-wireless models in 2021</a>. Campagnolo has also now gone fully unwired with its latest <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/campagnolo-super-record-wireless-groupset\">Super Record Wireless</a> 12-speed groupset, although it’s not added a thirteenth sprocket for the road, as it did with the mechanical <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/campagnolo-ekar-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Ekar gravel groupset</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though many will have individual preferences, each brand’s groupset range offers a variety of advantages (and disadvantages). With so many elements to consider, it can be slightly overwhelming when selecting a new groupset to know which one is best for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03134205/giant-revolt-0-review-2-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Drivetrain of gravel bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03134205/giant-revolt-0-review-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03134205/giant-revolt-0-review-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03134205/giant-revolt-0-review-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03134205/giant-revolt-0-review-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03134205/giant-revolt-0-review-2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03134205/giant-revolt-0-review-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03134205/giant-revolt-0-review-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03134205/giant-revolt-0-review-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03134205/giant-revolt-0-review-2-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Matthew Loveridge / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When comparing complete bikes, it’s worth noting that it’s commonplace for bike brands to mix in third party components when they spec a bike. In the example above the derailleurs and cassette are Shimano, while the crankset is from Praxis and the chain is a KMC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on to learn about different types of groupset, brand variations and an overview of each manufacturer’s road groupset hierarchy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is a groupset?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/02221528/1x_groupsets_sram-970x622.jpg\" alt=\"1x_groupsets_sram\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A groupset is the collection of mechanical parts that includes a bike’s drivetrain and brakes. This typically includes gear and brake levers, a crankset, derailleurs, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-chain\" target=\"_blank\">a chain</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cassette\" target=\"_blank\">a cassette</a> and a bottom bracket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some manufacturers may choose to include other components, such as a headset or pedals, though this is not standard practice. Brands may also sell groupset-matching components such as wheels, which carry groupset branding but aren’t considered part of the groupset itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Included in a groupset:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Gear levers</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Brake levers</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Brakes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Derailleur(s)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Crankset</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cassette</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Chain</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bottom bracket</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sometimes included in a groupset:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Headset</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cables / hoses</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pedals</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Seatpost</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hubs</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Not usually included in a groupset:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Frame</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fork</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Handlebars</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stem</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bar tape</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Saddle</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wheels</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tyres</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s the difference between road and gravel groupsets?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/shimano-grx-limited-11-970x647.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most road bike groupsets feature a crankset that has two chainrings, allowing for more gear combinations. The real-world implication of this is that the rider will have more gears to choose from to help them pedal at their desired cadence on the given terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-gravel-gearing-how-to-get-lower-gears\" target=\"_blank\">Gravel groupsets</a> are designed to perform better off road. Gravel riding needs lower gears and is harsher on the bike, and the uneven ground can cause the chain to jump about more. Clogging of a front derailleur with mud can also be an issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, most gravel groupsets offer a 1× crankset as an option, meaning it only has one chainring (and no need for a front derailleur). This chainring will feature wider teeth and special tooth profiles to help the chain stay in place. You can usually choose a double chainring variant as well for most gravel bike groupsets.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/shimano_grx_di2_review_01-1-970x647.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A gravel rear derailleur will typically feature a clutch mechanism, akin to those seen on mountain bikes, that helps provide more tension on the bottom span of the chain to reduce excess movement, chain slap on the chainstay and the risk of dropping a chain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Are electronic groupsets better than mechanical groupsets?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02223830/specialized-sworks-aethos-23-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Rear derailleur on road bike\" /><figcaption>Matthew Loveridge / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In an electronic groupset, the gears are operated by signals sent from the gear shifters. In some cases, this is done wirelessly, in others the shifters will be connected to the derailleurs via electronic wires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Removing standard metal cables eradicates issues such as drag caused by poor cable routing, cable stiffness, stretch, contamination and fraying. Gear adjustments are set-and-forget and the shifting itself is typically faster with electronic gears.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Electronic groupsets also let you change the shifting logic, usually via a phone app and a Bluetooth connection to the groupset. This allows you, for instance, to swap what the shift levers do, set up sequential shifting where the front derailleur changes automatically when you reach a certain point on the cassette at the rear. They can also automatically shift the rear derailleur up or down a few sprockets when you choose to make a front shift, so that you’re not left spinning or grinding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get gear use and other stats and you can link the derailleurs up to a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-computers-gps-computers-for-training-navigation-and-data\">bike computer</a>, so that you can view your current gear ratios.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/cinelli_laser_5-970x647.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However electronic groupsets are not without their downsides. The components themselves tend to be much more expensive, not only to purchase but also to repair, and issues with connectivity and wiring can still throw a spanner in the works. Plus, you need to remember to keep your batteries charged or you may be stranded in one gear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, electronic shifting is great if you have the time and the money to invest in it, but for most users’ needs, standard mechanical cable shifting is entirely capable. Having said that, electronic shifting is gradually trickling down to lower price points, increasing the affordability of groupsets and bikes equipped with them, as we’ll see later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How much does a good groupset cost?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-7-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Dura-Ace crankset on bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-7-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-7-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-7-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-7-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-7-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-7-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-7-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-7-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-7-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Matthew Loveridge / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>How long is a piece of string? The definition of a good groupset is largely determined by the rider’s intended use and expectations. Mid-level road groupsets can start from around £500 / $600 whereas the top-level models can be as much as £4,500 / $5,600.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re putting together a racing bike, it’s likely the speed of an electronic groupset will appeal but you’ll pay a hefty premium for it. For general day-to-day riding, even entry-level cable-actuated groupsets are just fine. More important is the number of sprockets in the cassette at the rear, or ‘speeds’ and the gear range of the ratios offered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lowest priced groupsets offer 7 or 8 speeds. This makes for large jumps between gear ratios, so it may be difficult to select a gear that enables you to ride comfortably in your preferred <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cyclist-guide-cadence\">cadence</a> (how fast you turn the pedals). They may also have a more limited range of gear ratios, which can make <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/top-10-tips-to-improve-your-climbing\">climbing hills</a> harder work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, higher spec groupsets will offer 10, 11 or 12 speeds. This gives you more ratios to play with, narrower jumps between ratios and usually a wider range with more low ratios to allow you to spin up hills more easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each manufacturer will have different variations on the same theme, but it is worth choosing the one whose features and ergonomics suit you, and whose price you can live with.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shimano vs SRAM vs Campagnolo: Who does what and how?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shimano</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-14-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Road bike brake lever with Dura-Ace logo\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-14-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-14-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-14-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-14-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-14-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-14-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-14-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-14-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/specialized-sworks-aethos-14-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Matthew Loveridge / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded in 1921 by its namesake, Shozaburo Shimano, Shimano is undoubtedly the oldest manufacturer of the trio and is well-established as one of the big names in bicycle componentry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the modern road market, Shimano is best known for its Dura-Ace, Ultegra and 105 series, all of which use Di2, Shimano’s electronic technology, on the latest models (although the brand still sells a 12-speed cable-operated <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/shimano-105-mechanical-r7100-groupset\" target=\"_blank\">105 groupset</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano gear shifters are operated by two paddles on each lever. Though the electronic gears can be configured to function solely from either shifter, as standard the left shifter operates the front derailleur, and the right shifter operates the rear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the cable-actuated levers, the whole right-hand brake lever is clicked inwards to downshift to an easier gear (moving the chain up the cassette to a larger sprocket) and the smaller inner paddle is clicked to upshift to a harder one (moving the chain <em>down </em>the cassette to a smaller sprocket).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The left brake lever moves inwards to upshift (moving the chain to the larger chainring) while the small paddle is for downshifts (moving the chain to the smaller chainring).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is replicated on the electronic shifters but with buttons rather than mechanical paddles, and the levers themselves function solely as a brake lever and don’t move sideways.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shimano road and gravel groupset hierarchy (high to low)</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/shimano_dura-ace_9200_review_01-970x647.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>12 speed</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-dura-ace-r9200-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Dura-Ace R9200</a> <em>(electronic)</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-dura-ace-r9200-and-ultegra-r8100-shimano-finally-goes-12-speed\" target=\"_blank\">Ultegra R8100</a> <em>(electronic)</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/shimano-105-di2\" target=\"_blank\">105 R7100</a> <em>(electronic/mechanical)</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-grx-rx820-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">GRX RX820 / RX610</a> <em>(gravel, mechanical)</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>11 speed</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-dura-ace-9100-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Dura-Ace R9100 / R9120</a> <em>(electronic/mechanical)</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-grx-di2-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">GRX RX815</a> <em>(gravel, electronic)</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-ultegra-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Ultegra R8000 / R8020 </a><em>(electronic/mechanical)</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-grx-gravel-groupset\" target=\"_blank\">GRX RX810 / RX600</a> <em>(gravel, mechanical)</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-105-r7000-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">105 R7000 / R7020</a> <em>(mechanical)</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>10 speed</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>GRX RX400 <em>(gravel)</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tiagra 4700 / 4720</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>9 speed</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sora R3000</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>8 speed</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Claris 2400 / 2403</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For an in-depth look at Shimano’s road and gravel series, see our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-shimano-groupsets\" target=\"_blank\">buyer’s guide to Shimano groupsets</a>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>SRAM</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/sram_force_8-970x646.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In comparison to the other brands, SRAM is a relatively new player in the game, but made waves when it entered the market in 1987, with the introduction of the grip shifter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, popular mountain bike components also sit alongside the strong road bike series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM electronic road shifters operate in conjunction with one another, and feature one shift button on each.

With unique shifter ergonomics and starting at a higher price bracket, Campagnolo targets a traditional roadie audience with its groupsets but has expanded into gravel as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo’s mechanical shifting operation has always incorporated both finger and thumb actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To move the chain up the cassette or crankset, the shift paddle that sits behind the brake lever is used. A smaller, more button-like paddle that sits on the inside face of the shifter is then thumb-operated to shift back down. As with both Shimano and cable-actuated SRAM, the left shifter operates the front derailleur, the right shifter operating the rear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo’s older electronic groupsets operated the same logic and included the thumb shifter, but its latest <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/campagnolo-super-record-wireless-groupset\">Super Record Wireless</a> groupset has broken with tradition and has two finger-operated shift levers placed one above the other. The upper shifter on the right brake lever shifts into an easier gear ratio, the lower one into a harder ratio. On the left lever, the upper shift lever moves the chain onto the large chainring, the lower one shifts it to the smaller chainring.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Campagnolo road groupset hierarchy (high to low)</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/campagnolo_12_speed_chainset-1.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>13 speed (gravel only, sits outside main hierarchy)</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/campagnolo-ekar-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Ekar</a> <em>(gravel)</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>12 speed</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/campagnolo-super-record-wireless-groupset\" target=\"_blank\">Super Record Wireless</a> <em>(electronic)</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Record</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/campagnolo-chorus-12-speed-groupset\" target=\"_blank\">Chorus</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>11 speed</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Centaur</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For an in-depth look at Campagnolo’s road series, see our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-campagnolo-groupsets\" target=\"_blank\">buyer’s guide to Campagnolo groupsets</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How do I choose which groupset to buy?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/giant-tcr-advanced-matthew-lover_2-970x647.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the choice when buying a complete bike is often taken away from you, choosing a groupset from scratch is not an easy ask.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve never ridden a road bike before, it is worth testing different bikes equipped with each of the manufacturers’ groupsets to get a feel for what works most naturally for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a road bike aficionado and know which manufacturer you prefer, but are unsure which model to go for, working out the bike’s intended use is key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you aren’t competing in high level racing, it’s not necessary to get the most expensive groupset available to still have a fantastic experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/sram-rival-groupset-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"sram-rival-groupset-1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>More money will get you more gear options, lighter components and a more refined set up but if you’re relatively new to cycling, or budget is a high priority, the lower end of the spectrum will still serve you well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With cheaper starting and running costs, more modest groupsets are still equipped to do everything you need them to. Some parts like cassettes and chains are wear items and need to be replaced regularly to keep your bike running smoothly. An 8-speed cassette will cost you around ten times less than a top spec 12-speed model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Component makers have put huge efforts into refining their groupsets and it’s now the norm for trickle-down technology to benefit the cheaper options in the range, so even the entry-level groupsets should work well. It’s much more likely that your legs will give out before your gears.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Want to know more about road bikes?
