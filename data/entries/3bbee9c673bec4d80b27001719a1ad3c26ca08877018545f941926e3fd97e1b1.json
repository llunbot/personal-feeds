The Aventure model is one of the brand’s best-selling bikes so it makes sense that the Aventure was the next in line in the company’s massive move to improve their offerings following the Abound <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/aventon-new-abound-sr-short-rack-cargo-ebike/\" target=\"_blank\">SR</a> and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-aventon-abound-lr-cargo-ebike-review/\" target=\"_blank\">LR</a>, and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/aventon-level-3-commuter-city-ebike/\" target=\"_blank\">Level 3</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-aventue-3-and-M.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-aventue-3-and-M.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Aventure 3 and Full Suspension aventue 3 and M\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-aventue-3-and-M.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-aventue-3-and-M-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-aventue-3-and-M-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-aventue-3-and-M-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / R.

New for this beast is a full redesign of the geometry. The goal in tweaking the geo of the Aventure was to create a bike that instantly feels familiar. It rolls on 26 x 4″ tires, has a front suspension fork, and a suspension seatpost. It’s a Class 2 eBike, with up to a 60-mile range and a 440-pound payload.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Motor: 750W (80Nm torque)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Display: BC280 Side Display</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Brakes: Tektro Hydraulic Disc Brakes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weight: Step Through Frame (76 lbs) Step Over Frame (77 lbs)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Drivetrain: Shimano Altus 8-Speed</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Frame Type: Gravity Cast, 6061 Aluminum </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tires: 26″ x 4″ Fat Tires</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Seatpost: Suspension Seatpost with Preload Adjustment</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Includes: Rear rack, fenders, and kickstand</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Assistance: Throttle plus pedal assist with Ride Tune capability. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Aventure M</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-aventure-M.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-aventure-M.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Aventure 3 and Full Suspension aventure M\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-aventure-M.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-aventure-M-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-aventure-M-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-aventure-M-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Retail: TBD</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Aventure M has yet to be priced as of this writing. Its official release is right around the corner, following the launch of the Aventure 3. Aventon wants you to know that the “M” is on its way, just in case you would rather wait to get it instead of the Aventure 3. OK, cool. Got that outta the way. Let’s take a look at what this new Aventure M has to offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-a100-Aventure-M.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-a100-Aventure-M.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Aventure 3 and Full Suspension a100 Aventure M\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-a100-Aventure-M.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-a100-Aventure-M-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-a100-Aventure-M-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-a100-Aventure-M-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The all brand new Aventure M is the second bike in the Aventon line to feature Aventon’s proprietary A100 centerdrive motor. It’s a Class 1 eBike with up to an 85-mile range, and a claimed 100Nm of torque.

It will also downshift when stopped at a light. All of this is completely adjustable via the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Aventure 3 and M Geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step-Trough Geo</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-step-through-geo-e1744400074876.webp\"><img width=\"1170\" height=\"560\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-step-through-geo-e1744400074876.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Aventure 3 and Full Suspension step through geo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-step-through-geo-e1744400074876.webp 1170w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-step-through-geo-e1744400074876-297x142.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-step-through-geo-e1744400074876-120x57.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-step-through-geo-e1744400074876-768x368.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo of the geo chart</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step-Over Geo</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-step-over-geo-e1744400154633.webp\"><img width=\"1070\" height=\"514\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-step-over-geo-e1744400154633.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Aventure 3 and Full Suspension step over geo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-step-over-geo-e1744400154633.webp 1070w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-step-over-geo-e1744400154633-297x143.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-step-over-geo-e1744400154633-120x58.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-step-over-geo-e1744400154633-768x369.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo of the geo chart</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Aventon Mid-Drive Full-Suspension Prototype</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>More exciting at the Aventon booth was their prototype of a possible full-suspension eMTB. Everything about the bike on display in the tent was 100% prototype. Absolutely nothing is set in stone about the bike, and they weren’t really willing to confirm anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-prototype-full.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-prototype-full.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Aventure 3 and Full Suspension prototype full\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-prototype-full.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-prototype-full-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-prototype-full-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-prototype-full-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / R.

It will more than likely be available with a carbon and/or aluminum main triangle. Which version of the frame will be released first is still being discussed within the brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-prototype-front.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-prototype-front.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Aventure 3 and Full Suspension prototype front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-prototype-front.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-prototype-front-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-prototype-front-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-prototype-front-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All said and done, it looks solid, and I’m pretty excited to get on it and give it a good beating when it finally gets released. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-proto-rear-end.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-proto-rear-end.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Aventure 3 and Full Suspension proto rear end\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-proto-rear-end.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-proto-rear-end-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-proto-rear-end-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-proto-rear-end-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-prototype-display.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-prototype-display.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Aventure 3 and Full Suspension prototype display\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-prototype-display.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-prototype-display-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-prototype-display-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-prototype-display-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-proto-side-shot.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-proto-side-shot.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Aventure 3 and Full Suspension proto side shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-proto-side-shot.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-proto-side-shot-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-proto-side-shot-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Aventon-Aventure-3-and-Full-Suspension-proto-side-shot-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.aventon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Aventon.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/aventon-launches-new-mid-drive-aventure-m-and-gives-a-full-suspension-emtb-sneak-peek/\">Aventon Launches New Mid-Drive Aventure M and Gives a Full-Suspension eMTB Sneak Peek</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"3bbee9c673bec4d80b27001719a1ad3c26ca08877018545f941926e3fd97e1b1","category":"Cycling"}
