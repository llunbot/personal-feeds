This enables considerably better display support, allowing for more and higher-resolution displays with higher refresh rates. Thunderbolt 4 has maximum speeds of 40 Gbps, making Thunderbolt 5 a significant improvement of at least double the bandwidth. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe latest specification also features double the PCI Express data throughput and double the bandwidth of Thunderbolt Networking. It also uses a new signaling technology, PAM-3, to increase performance with printed circuit boards, connectors, and passive cables.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/thunderbolt-5-specifications.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThunderbolt 5 continues to be built in industry standards such as USB4 V2, DisplayPort 2.1, and PCI Express Gen 4, enabling it to be compatible with previous version of Thunderbolt and USB. Computers and accessories that use Intel's Thunderbolt 5 controller are set to become available starting in 2024. It is highly likely that Thunderbolt 5 will come to future Apple devices.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/intel/\">Intel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/thunderbolt/\">Thunderbolt</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/thunderbolt-5/\">Thunderbolt 5</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/thunderbolt-5-announced-with-up-to-3x-bandwidth/\">Thunderbolt 5 Announced With Up to 3x More Bandwidth</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/thunderbolt-5-announced-with-up-to-3x-more-bandwidth.2401148/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"894716a92af8f5eca2bfdafe4a21fc4d56007baa8c937806d0b139906211aa24","category":"Apple"}
