enters the frame from the sides of the head tube.</p>\n<p>The bike also features a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/sram-udh/\">SRAM Universal Derailleur Hanger</a> on the rear dropout and ISCG-2 guide mounts should you wish to add a bash guard or chain guide.</p>\n<p>Whyte has kept British winters in mind and has given the bike a rubber gator on the seat tube collar to keep water and grit from entering the frame.</p>\n<section>\n    <div>\n        \n<h3>What is Bike of the Week?</h3>\n<p>Every fortnight, we’ll bring you a detailed first look at one of the latest bikes (or framesets) to arrive at BikeRadar HQ – from road to commuting, gravel to enduro, and anything in between.</p>\n<p>This is our chance to introduce the bike and everything that makes it unique before hitting the road or trails.</p>\n<p>Head to our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-week/\">Bike of the Week hub</a> for previous editions.</p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section>\n\n<h2>Slack and steep</h2>\n<p>The E-Lyte 150 Works has very contemporary geometry, with a 64.6-degree head angle that’s slack by <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">trail bike</a> standards and a relatively steep seat tube angle of 77.2 degrees.</p>\n<p>The bike also features geometry adjust in the shock extender, which can slacken the head angle to 64 degrees and reduce the bottom bracket height from 342mm to 334mm.</p>\n<p>To adjust the geometry, you need to remove the shock mount bolt on the linkage and the shock extender then rotate a brass bushing 180 degrees.</p>\n<p>For reference, Canyon’s similarly trail-orientated <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/canyon-spectralon-cfr-review/\">Spectral:ON</a> has a head angle of 65.5 degrees and a seat tube angle of 76.5 degrees.</p>\n<p>A steeper seat tube angle benefits climbing, because it positions your weight further forward over the cranks, reducing the feeling of looping out off the rear of the bike.</p>\n<p>Chainstay lengths are also comparatively long, with all-size frames said to measure 450mm.</p>\n<p>Whyte offers the E-Lyte 150 Works in four sizes: S, M, L and XL.</p>\n<div>\n                <table>\n
