Plans for the restored bridge morphed from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/12/captain-i-saved-the-bridge-boldly-going-where-no-tv-set-has-gone-before/\">opening it up to non-commercial uses</a> like weddings or educational events <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/no-romulans-just-angry-volunteers-one-mans-journey-to-restore-star-treks-bridge/\">into a fully fledged museum</a>, and now that museum is almost ready to open. Backers of the project on Kickstarter have been notified that Sci-Fi World Museum will open to them in Santa Monica, California, on May 27, with general admission beginning in June.</p>\n<p>It's not actually the original set from <em>TNG</em>, as that was destroyed while filming <em>Star Trek: Generations</em>, when the saucer section crash-lands on Veridian III. But three replicas were made, overseen by Michael Okuda and Herman Zimmerman, the show's set designers. Two of those welcomed Trekkies at <em>Star Trek: The Experience</em>, an attraction in Las Vegas until <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/farewell-star-trek-the-experience.110085/\">it closed in 2008</a>.</p>\n<p>The third spent time in Hollywood, then traveled to Europe and Asia for <em>Star Trek: World Tour</em> before it ended up languishing in a warehouse in Long Beach. It's this third globe-trotting Enterprise-D bridge that—like the grit that gets an oyster to create a pearl—now finds a science-fiction museum accreted around it. Well, mostly—the chairs used by Riker, Troi, Data, and some other bits were salvaged from the Las Vegas exhibit.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012173#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012173&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
