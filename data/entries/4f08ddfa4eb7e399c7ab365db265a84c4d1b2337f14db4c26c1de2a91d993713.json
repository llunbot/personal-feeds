It was able to charge iPhones at up to 15W. The alternative was Qi charging, which was limited to 7.5W, but it didn't require using Apple technology.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nQi2 brought 15W charging speeds that were on par with ‌MagSafe‌, giving us charging speed parity for a short time. Accessory makers could design magnetic chargers that offered 15W charging without paying Apple a fee. That's over now, and we're back in the exact same situation we had when it was original ‌MagSafe‌ vs. original Qi.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nQi2 chargers will only charge ‌iPhone 16‌ models at up to 15W, and 25W charging will be limited to ‌MagSafe‌. This time around, it's a wider difference because 25W charging is fast charging and can provide up to 50 percent power in 30 minutes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple released a new version of the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger alongside the ‌iPhone 16‌ models, so it doesn't look like existing ‌MagSafe‌ chargers are going to provide 25W. Apple says the 25W charging requires a \"new\" ‌MagSafe‌ charger, which means accessory makers and customers alike will need new charging accessories to get the updated ‌MagSafe‌ speeds. Note that the new ‌MagSafe‌ charger still charges older iPhones at 15W. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile it's just the ‌iPhone 16‌ models that support 25W charging now, this is a new baseline that will be added to future iPhones, and 15W Qi2 charging will soon be antiquated.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16\">iPhone 16 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro\">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/10/apple-obsoletes-qi2-wireless-charging/\">Apple One-Ups 15W Qi2 Charging With 25W MagSafe Charging in iPhone 16 lineup</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-one-ups-15w-qi2-charging-with-25w-magsafe-charging-in-iphone-16-lineup.2435799/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4f08ddfa4eb7e399c7ab365db265a84c4d1b2337f14db4c26c1de2a91d993713","category":"Apple"}
