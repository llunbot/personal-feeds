The start and finish vary every year as do the Control Points (CPs) and set Parcours. For 2023 the route starts in Belgium and ends in Greece.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The clock never stops and riders are required to plan, research and navigate their own course and choose when, where and if to rest. It can take anywhere from nine days to over two weeks to complete the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The TCR was founded in 2013 by <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/british-rider-mike-hall-killed-after-being-struck-by-a-car-during-indian-pacific-wheel\" target=\"_blank\">the late Mike Hall</a>, regarded as one of the greatest endurance cyclists of all time. Hall was killed in a road accident during the Indian Pacific Wheel Race in Australia in 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2023 TCR: Key information</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Start date:</strong> 23rd July 2023</li><li><strong>Start:</strong> Geraardsbergen, Belgium</li><li><strong>Control Points:</strong> Passo dello Spluga, Italy, Zgornje Jezersko, Slovenia, Peshkopi, Albania and Meteora, Greece</li><li><strong>Finish:</strong> Thessaloniki, Greece</li><li><strong>2022 winner:</strong> Christoph Strasser</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>The TCR route</h2>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The TCR does not have a set route or length, instead it has Control Points, Parcours and a set start and finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riders are expected to research and plan their routes themselves and must include each of the CPs and set Parcours. Typically most riders will cover 4,000-4,500km depending on the route they take however this year’s route is expected to be a bit less at around 3,500km. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002533/fiona_kolbinger_profile_04-970x546.jpg\" alt=\"fiona_kolbinger_profile_04\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002533/fiona_kolbinger_profile_04-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002533/fiona_kolbinger_profile_04-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002533/fiona_kolbinger_profile_04-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002533/fiona_kolbinger_profile_04-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002533/fiona_kolbinger_profile_04-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002533/fiona_kolbinger_profile_04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Angus Sung</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For 2023, the route starts in Geraardsbergen in Belgium and includes the area’s fabled Muur-Kapelmuur climb, with its 9% average gradient and pitching to 20% on the steepest bends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CPs in the 2023 edition include Passo dello Spluga in Italy, Zgornje Jezersko in the Slovenian Alps, Peshkopi in Albania and Meteora in Greece.

This means not accepting help from other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, riders cannot share equipment, ask for directions, or have any sort of support vehicle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riders must agree to follow the TCR’s ten rules, which dictate what they can and cannot do. Those who are in a pair are regarded as one entity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However the boundaries of what it means to be self-supported can be blurry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, there was a small dispute over whether the purchasing of a can of coke went against the rules and led to a delay in the Christoph Strasser being announced as the winner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Front runners Strasser and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ulrich-bartholmoes-cyclist\" target=\"_blank\">Ulrich Bartholmoes</a> both ended up being at the same supermarket and decided to drink a can of coke together to celebrate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bartholmoes’ bank card wasn’t working so Strasser gave him €1 for the coke. However, because of the TCR rules on being self-supported, there was a debate over whether this was outside assistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, and after evidence was supplied by both parties, it was decided that the act of buying the coke was sportsmanship and had no impact on the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Interested in all things ultra cycling?
