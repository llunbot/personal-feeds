{"title":"Ed Zitron: ‘The Man Who Killed Google Search’","link":"https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-men-who-killed-google/?ref=ed-zitrons-wheres-your-ed-at-newsletter","date":1713999325000,"content":"\n<p>Absolutely scathing dissection of what’s gone wrong at Google Search, by Ed Zitron for his newsletter/blog:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90241011/this-man-has-helped-shape-google-search-almost-from-the-start?ref=wheresyoured.at\">an interview with FastCompany’s Harry McCracken from\n2018</a>, Gomes framed Google’s challenge as “taking [the\nPageRank algorithm] from one machine to a whole bunch of machines,\nand they weren’t very good machines at the time.” Despite his\nimpact and tenure, Gomes had only been made Head of Search in the\nmiddle of 2018 after John Giannandrea moved to Apple to work on\nits machine learning and AI strategy. Gomes had been described as\nGoogle’s “search czar,” beloved for his ability to communicate\nacross departments.</p>\n\n<p>Every single article I’ve read about Gomes’ tenure at Google spoke\nof a man deeply ingrained in the foundation of one of the most\nimportant technologies ever made, who had dedicated decades to\nmaintaining a product with a — to quote Gomes himself — “<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90241011/this-man-has-helped-shape-google-search-almost-from-the-start?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=To%20me%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20the%20guiding%20light%20of%20serving%20the%20user%20and%20using%20technology%20to%20do%20that\">guiding light of serving the user and using technology to do\nthat</a>.” And when finally given the keys to the kingdom — the ability to elevate Google Search even further — he was\nratfucked by a series of rotten careerists trying to please Wall\nStreet, led by Prabhakar Raghavan.</p>\n\n<p>Do you want to know what Prabhakar Raghavan’s old job was? What\nPrabhakar Raghavan, the new head of Google Search, the guy that\nhas run Google Search into the ground, the guy who is currently\ndestroying search, did before his job at Google?</p>\n\n<p><em>He was the head of search for Yahoo from 2005 through 2012</em> — a\ntumultuous period that cemented its terminal decline, and\neffectively saw the company bow out of the search market\naltogether. His responsibilities? Research and development for\nYahoo’s search and ads products.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Long story short, Ben Gomes was a search guy who’d been at Google since 1999,  <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/06/05/evolution-of-adwords\">before they even had any ads in search results</a>. He was replaced by Prabhakar Raghavan, who previously was Head of Ads at the company. So instead of there being any sort of firewall between search and ads, search became a subsidiary of ads.</p>\n\n<p>Zitron’s compelling narrative is largely gleaned through emails released as part of the DOJ’s antitrust case against Google. Is the story really that simple? That around 2019 or so Google Search’s institutional priorities flipped from quality-first/revenue-second, to revenue-first/quality-second? It might be more complicated than that, but the timeline sure does add up.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/24/zitron-google-search\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9c4784d30c5f1b139a227b79b7868e0d21ce6d8ea1203ac0f5b9093b5701a934","category":"Tech"}
