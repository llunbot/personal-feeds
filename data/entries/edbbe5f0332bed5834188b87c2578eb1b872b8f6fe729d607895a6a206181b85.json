Using wider, differential rim shapes and intricate new hubs, Factor says the wheels save significant weight despite not giving up any aero performance in real-world conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pricing remains lofty but is unchanged from the previous bike: frameset options still cost £5,449/$5,499/€5,799/AU$8,999 and full builds range from £8,999/$9,199/€8,849/AU$14,999 with Shimano Ultegra Di2 to £11,399/$11,499/€11,049/AU$18,899 with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/exclusive-in-depth-review-sram-red-etap-axs-hydraulic-road-disc\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM Red AXS</a> + Quarq power meter. The bike is available to buy now.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n

team when it came to revising the original Ostro basically amounted to “just don’t screw it up”,’ says Rob Gitelis, Factor’s founder. ‘We wanted to improve aerodynamics, but only if we didn’t have to do it at the expense of the Ostro’s other characteristics, as we were happy with aspects like <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-frame-stiffness\" target=\"_blank\">stiffness</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-bike-geometry-handling\" target=\"_blank\">handling</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-weight-limit\" target=\"_blank\">weight</a>.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the brand’s claims are to be believed – and given how transparent Gitelis and Factor’s director of engineering, Graham Shrive, were when it came to how the bike was developed and validated, it wouldn’t seem too unreasonable to believe them – it is mission accomplished: Factor says the Ostro 2 is 10% faster than <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/factor-ostro-vam-review\" target=\"_blank\">its predecessor</a>. It equates to a 0.055 saving in the bike’s coefficient of drag. Expressed less esoterically, in power, it’s seven watts more efficient at 45kmh on average across a range of wind angles, beating a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cervelo-s5-review-2\" target=\"_blank\">Cervélo S5</a> by 6% and a Specialized Tarmac SL8 by almost 7% over the same yaw sweep. Whichever way you slice it, in relative terms the new bike is significantly faster than the old one and slipperier than popular competitors, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We had the opportunity to make these gains because of developments that occurred during the previous bike’s tenure,’ says Shrive. ‘We built a new facility that streamlines our development process, UCI rule changes around frameset and component depth-to-width ratios let us change tube shapes, Shimano going semi-wireless helped us simplify the Ostro’s front end, computational fluid dynamics software is four years more powerful, and there were aspects of the industrial design process we could “de-bottleneck”.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-5-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Factor Ostro 2 detail\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-5-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-5-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-5-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-5-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-5-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-5-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-5.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Factor</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Shrive gives the example of the seat post fastener changing from a wedge binder at the front of the tube ‘which wasn’t well liked’ to a clamping plate on the back of the tube.

Shrive says to improve, the design had to be broken down into chunks, with each area developed individually before being cohesively stitched back together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘As evident in the final product, we spent of most of our time reworking the front of the bike, making it not only fast in itself but also better at manipulating what it does to the airflow downstream,’ says Shrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Ostro’s fork is now designed around bigger 28mm tyres, but is in fact smaller in frontal area than outgoing bike’s fork.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We took a lot of bulk out of the fork crown, and the fork legs’ stance is generally narrower to produce less of a drag impact downstream,’ says Shrive. ‘Likewise, the fork blades are shaped to more smoothly interact with the wheel axle and brake calliper.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fork’s leading edge is further forward too, pairing neatly with an extended headtube that also is more heavily waisted than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The nose cone and hourglass frontal profile both reduce frontal area and extend flow attachment, steering the airflow in between the rider’s legs,’ says Shrive. ‘The result is lower drag not just in a headwind, but at a range of different wind angles.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-4-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"Factor Ostro 2 detail\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-4-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-4-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-4-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-4-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-4.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Factor</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The head tube now more neatly flows into a tapered top tube. Viewed from above, the top tube’s longitudinal cross-section is almost perfectly aerofoil shaped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The previous head-to-top tube transition had inflection points just behind the head tube, where it pinched inward,’ says Shrive. ‘This encouraged airflow detachment. The new shape is a longer, tapering profile to the rear, facilitated by a thinner seat tube. This was allowed by the UCI reducing the minimum tube thickness, something we also took advantage of in our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/factor-o2-vam-review-2\" target=\"_blank\">O2 VAM</a>.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The seatpost width has been reduced by 36%, but while the seat tube correspondingly matches that as a truncated aerofoil at its top, it varies in profile down its length more than any other tube in the bike. Just above the front derailleur mount for example, the tube is quasi-triangular, acting as the nose to an aerofoil completed by the tyre and wheel rim tucked in behind it. Shrive says the interplay in the area is even given a little boost by new bottle cages developed for the Ostro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We’ve done something pretty cool here,’ he says. ‘We figured pros eject their bottles for the sprint. While the down tube cage is hidden, the seat tube cage is more exposed, so we should make that cage aero. We did it by adding angled vanes either side of the cage mounting point, which funnel and accelerate the air through the cage, along the seat tube and off across the back of the bike. It’s basically a fairing, but not, so it’s almost cheating, but not.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Weight from the wheels</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-12-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Factor Ostro 2 detail\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-12-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-12-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-12-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-12-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-12-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-12-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-12-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-12.jpg 1518w\" /><figcaption>Factor</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As is perhaps understandable, with several tube profiles slimming down the new Ostro drops a little timber while gaining a few watts, but only to the tune of around 50g or so. However, the value Factor places on aggregating gains sees it look to release auxiliary components under its Black Inc brand as part and parcel of new frameset projects. The cockpit the new Ostro uses is carried over from the 02 VAM, but the Ostro’s wheels are a new design dubbed 48/58, in reference to differential rim depths, and it’s in this area Factor has made significant developments in weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new wheels are a claimed 206g lighter than Black Inc’s previous 60 all-round race wheels, coming in at a claimed 1,283g. Part of that comes from the overall decrease in depth and a move to carbon spokes, but renovated ‘high-flange’ hubs are a contributor too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The high flanges increase spoke bracing angle,’ says Shrive. ‘This increases lateral stiffness, but the hub shells themselves have been aggressively carved out to minimise weight.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another feature helping stiffness is the rims’ offset spoke bed, which works to balance spoke better as it accounts for the hub asymmetry caused by rotor mounts and the freehub body on the rear wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Our pros reported that our 60s were a little grabby in crosswinds,’ says Shrive. ‘So we’ve gone shallower at the front to counter this, as well as made the rims wider. This means they pair better with 28m tyres, and it relaxes the curve of the leading edge too, meaning airflow is smoother across the rim surface and stalls aren’t as pronounced. So while they aren’t quite as fast in a direct headwind, they are faster and easier to handle in sidewinds.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Built different</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-6-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Factor Ostro 2 detail\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-6-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-6-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-6-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-6-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-6-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-6-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-6-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-6.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Factor</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Factor is in the unusual position of being in control of every step of its fabrication process, given that it owns its own factories and has the facilities and expertise to mean that nothing needs to be outsourced. While the brand keeps more than a little bit of its production method under wraps, it does admit that it hasn’t used anything magical in its new Ostro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We just use the best materials and do the best with it,’ says Gitelis. ‘Things like using latex covered EPS moulds, base frame plies being Textreme (a premium woven carbon composite). That’s what makes the difference, but it’s expensive. However, unlike most brands, production cost doesn’t govern what we do, it is an outcome of it.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gitelis says that even Factor’s no expense spared approach has its limit these days though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The new Ostro frame in a size 56cm weighs 820g, and we’re starting to bump up against floor in terms of how much lighter we can go and still maintain the frame’s robustness. It would become too fragile otherwise, and wouldn’t stand up to wear and tear. As it is though, despite the Ostro’s premium materials it’s as sturdy as they come.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-composite-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-composite-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-composite-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-composite-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-composite-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-composite-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-composite-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-composite-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-composite-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-composite-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-composite.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption>Factor</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The result of Factor’s approach to frame building is that the cost of entry is high, but the brand says it hasn’t increased frameset price over the last generation, and any price differences at the same build tiers are a reflection of component pricing rather than any in-house increases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ostro is available in six sizes and three colours right now, with more colour options on the way, and custom paint options are available too – Factor’s in-house paint shop extends to custom wheel and component decals now as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Factor Ostro range and pricing</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-15-970x344.jpg\" alt=\"Factor Ostro 2 pricing\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-15-970x344.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-15-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-15-768x272.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-15-1536x545.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-15-750x266.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-15-1140x404.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/factor-ostro-2024-news-15.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Factor</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/factor-ostro-2\">New Factor Ostro leaves old design in its wake </a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Sam Challis &#124; Tech Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"edbbe5f0332bed5834188b87c2578eb1b872b8f6fe729d607895a6a206181b85","category":"Cycling"}
