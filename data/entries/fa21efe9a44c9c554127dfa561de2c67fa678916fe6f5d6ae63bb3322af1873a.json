Google Ruling","link":"https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores","date":1728346861000,"content":"\n<p>Sean Hollister, writing for The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Google’s Android app store is an illegal monopoly — and now it\nwill have to change. Today, Judge James Donato issued his final\nruling <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23945184/epic-v-google-fortnite-play-store-antitrust-trial-updates\">in <em>Epic v. Google</em></a>, ordering Google to effectively\nopen up the Google Play app store to competition for three whole\nyears. Google will have to distribute rival third-party app stores\n<em>within</em> Google Play, and it must give rival third-party app\nstores access to the full catalog of Google Play apps, unless\ndevelopers opt out individually.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I understand that this ruling is punishment for Google being held to have an illegal monopoly, and that making the full Play Store catalog of apps and games available to third-party app stores is strong medicine indeed. But how is making inclusion opt-out rather than opt-in for those apps and games going to work exactly? Imagine you make an Android game and it’s currently exclusive to the Play Store. You, the developer, do nothing, and thus your game is now available in third-party Android app stores. How are in-app purchases going to work? How are those third-party stores — which you, the developer, have no relationship with — going to pay you? What are you going to do if users have technical support complaints because of problems with the store? This seems like a nightmare in the making for third-party developers.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These were <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/12/24128531/epic-google-proposed-injunction-remedies\">Epic’s biggest asks</a>, and they might change the\nAndroid app marketplace forever — if they aren’t immediately\npaused or blocked on appeal. And they’re not all that Epic has won\ntoday. Starting November 1st, 2024, and ending November 1st, 2027,\nGoogle must also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stop requiring Google Play Billing for apps distributed on the\nGoogle Play Store (the jury found that Google had illegally tied\nits payment system to its app store)</li>\n<li>Let Android developers tell users about other ways to pay from\nwithin the Play Store</li>\n<li>Let Android developers link to ways to download their apps\noutside of the Play Store</li>\n<li>Let Android developers set their own prices for apps\nirrespective of Play Billing</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If this ruling holds on appeal, it’s a real loss for Google, not a token loss.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/07/judge-bends-google-over-the-barrel\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"fa21efe9a44c9c554127dfa561de2c67fa678916fe6f5d6ae63bb3322af1873a","category":"Tech"}
