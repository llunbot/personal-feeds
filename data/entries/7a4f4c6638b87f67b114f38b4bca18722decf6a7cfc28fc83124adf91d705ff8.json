Or perhaps its 38 mm max tire clearance makes it an All-Road bike, right? Who knows anymore? Anyway, the EPO is built by <a href=\"https://www.larkincycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Darren Larkin</a> in Connecticut in very small batches.</p>\n<p>It’s made up of an assortment of the finest Columbus steel available. The Italian tubes provide a ride quality that will have you wanting to push this bike like you’ve been juiced up and are breaking away in the ’99 Tour de France. Each frame comes paired up with an <a href=\"https://enve.com/collections/road-components/products/ar-disc-fork\" target=\"_blank\">ENVE AR Disc Fork</a> to match the frame’s tire clearance and keep the front end light and nimble.</p>\n<p>If you’re an AXS devotee, the EPO is available with or without shifter housing guides.
