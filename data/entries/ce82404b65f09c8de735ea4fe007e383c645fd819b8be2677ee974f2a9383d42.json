The same way you move every other heavy thing — with mechanical advantage. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wtb-handle-2.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wtb-handle-2-800x450.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wtb-handle-2-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wtb-handle-2-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wtb-handle-2-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wtb-handle-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wtb-handle-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wtb-handle-2-2048x1153.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wtb-handle-2-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wtb-handle-2-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Devo, that takes the form of a hole cut into the rear of the saddle for a handle. You might think that would feel weird, but WTB claims the hole is unnoticeable to even the most sensitive of butts.  “[We] confirmed this through hundreds of hours of ride testing and pressure mapping,” the company wrote in a press release. (It is pretty far back there. If you’re leaning into your drops, for instance, you’d likely never notice it.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>WTB designed the Devo with e-riders in mind, dialing in flex and dampening to accommodate the tendency of e-mtb riders to “remain seated over technical, jarring terrain that a rider on a traditional bike would likely stand up to pedal through.” But other riders are sure to find some utility here. WTB points out that urban riders tend to have heavy loads with groceries and other cargo, and might also benefit from a handle within easy reach. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Saddle Design </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The WTB Devo has a dramatically flared shape and a wide nose, plus a rounded tail. It’s 260mm long, and 142mm wide at its widest point. There are two proprietary WTB padding options: DNA and HLX. According to WTB, HLX padding is a little heavier and squisher, while DNA is a little firmer and lighter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The saddle is also available with three different rail options. Here’s the full price breakdown:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB_Devo_Spec-Chart.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"221\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB_Devo_Spec-Chart-800x221.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB_Devo_Spec-Chart-800x221.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB_Devo_Spec-Chart-297x82.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB_Devo_Spec-Chart-120x33.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB_Devo_Spec-Chart-768x212.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB_Devo_Spec-Chart.jpg 1140w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Devo is available for North American riders now on WTB’s website, and is forthcoming at WTB retailers around the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wtb.com/pages/devo-w-pickup?goal=0_a2db05b7d4-3b4d7efe29-349126445&amp;mc_cid=3b4d7efe29&amp;mc_eid=29aee6db05\" target=\"_blank\"><em>wtb.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wtb-devo-saddle-handle/\">Get a Handle on Your eBike with the New WTB Devo Saddle</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Andrew Marshall","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ce82404b65f09c8de735ea4fe007e383c645fd819b8be2677ee974f2a9383d42","category":"Cycling"}
