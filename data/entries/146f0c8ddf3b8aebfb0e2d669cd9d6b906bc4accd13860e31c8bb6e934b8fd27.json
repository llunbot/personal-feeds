With a parts shortage and global pandemic, this year has tossed all it had at us. Instead of going silent and resting on what we have built, we decided to push harder and be more creative than ever, launching a bike every single month, despite these challenges. This led us to full year of trying new parts, new finishes, and having more fun, which is what this is supposed to be all about right?…<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/09/SV21_Ti_RuggedRoad_99.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>With that idea in mind it was time to officially embrace Ti and put it officially on the SV menu (and website) To do so we wanted to put together a special build package.
