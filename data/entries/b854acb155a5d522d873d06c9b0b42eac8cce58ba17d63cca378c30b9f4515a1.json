The lack of joins is intended to reduce weight and increase safety in case of a crash.</p>\n<p>Ultima claims the one-size-fits-all frame can accommodate riders between 140cm and 190cm tall.</p>\n<h2>Smart shifting</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike is built around a Valeo Smart eBike System.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Multipath uses the Valeo Smart eBike System. Valeo says this is the world’s first ebike system to combine an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electric-bike-motors/\">electric bike motor</a> and adaptive automatic transmission.</p>\n<p>The 48V mid-drive motor provides 130Nm of torque, according to Ultima.</p>\n<p>Valeo says the transmission system, which sits in the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">bottom bracket</a>, analyses data from the wheel speed, cadence, torque and gradient sensors with predictive software. It then adjusts the assist level, gear and cadence to best suit the rider’s behaviour and environment.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The display and controls are integrated into the handlebar.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>On the handlebar display, you can control the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">electric bike</a> motor and its integrated lights. If the bike is in manual transmission mode, you can select the assist level yourself. The screen displays speed, battery percentage and assist level.</p>\n<p>Three buttons on the remote control alter the assist and transmission (for example from manual to automatic) settings. A throttle engages the walk assist or boost mode. Its USB-C port can charge a device, such as a mobile phone, on the go.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Ultima makes full use of the plastic construction, moulding the bike’s logo into the frameset itself.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Safety features include a GPS tracker, available through the Ultima app, and the Neutral gear setting that locks the cranks when the bike is stationary.</p>\n<h2>Four bikes in one</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike is available with four different forks.

This fork comes with a kickstand and side basket.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The comfort fork is a Lefty-style single-leg fork.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Family Cargo fork can hold a child seat, with handrails for your little one to hold onto, over the front wheel. It also includes a kickstand.</p>\n<p>The Flex fork is a single-sided <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-suspension-forks/\">suspension fork</a> designed to make <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/what-is-gravel-riding/\">gravel riding</a> and urban escapades more comfortable, according to Ultima.
