Over the last six years, Zwift Academy has plucked a handful of riders from their virtual platform and handed them women’s WorldTour contracts with Canyon-SRAM. Zwift Academy also provides a pathway for men to join Alpecin-Fenix.</p><p>Enrollment has already begun and the training programs will hit Zwift on August 30th. Those just looking for some consistent training will be asked to complete six workouts, two recovery rides, one baseline ride and one finish line ride throughout the process. The program lasts nearly two months and ends on October 24th.</p><p>“Zwift Academy is known for its successful talent ID program but it’s so much more for thousands of riders each year”, says Stephen Gallagher, Co-Founder of Dig Deep Coaching and designer of the Zwift Academy workout plan. “We’ve designed the program to offer even more for those looking to take on the challenge of completing a training plan. The program covers many of the basic principles of training and should be a fun and rewarding experience for all abilities.”</p><p>Anyone hoping to land themselves in the professional peloton will have a bit more virtual riding to tackle. “Pro Contenders” are asked to complete the Zwift Academy program while also completing mandatory checks, heart rate monitoring, and power monitoring. They will also need to keep a Today’s Plan account updated with all the workouts required. <a href=\"http://prco.mail.pr.co/c/eJwVjdmOwyAMRb-mvBGxheUhD6OZ9jcqx5AWKYEMIRqlXz8gWfb18XLPI5Rn9JMzTjHip9nNFhYSNohr59Zwrbgl7wm1d-CN1Q0EN3LhZsksaouLn7mcCcK2Q3ylfma044ZgbiRdHbReaBInwQRnlhvOGRvtwAd1f9zHUdtvrqz4kfKmWPce9jJgJmVCWMM1LCXUTxvhhWtMrxr3o423AU5SJyxby3vJ_sQacyJ7CcfhM3ZjwbjWirSdJ-ZUAWunAAa0VZwyrTlVUioK0gdqUJsgBGicFVmnd637TX7dxKPF5y8utbt2DSWDb6IX2qxpfx6SD4WW8HvGEraQ6vEPWnhuqQ\" target=\"_blank\">More information on trying out for either Canyon-SRAM or Alpecin-Fenix via the Zwift Academy can be found here</a>.</p></div></div>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"1f5f53a4236251c14c92df60f3142aa82d55b3e05041f88597f62e922b61f822","category":"Cycling"}
