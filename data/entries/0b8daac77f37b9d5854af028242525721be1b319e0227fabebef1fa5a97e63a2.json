And now, there’s a Gravel Sweater made from the stuff. Yup, that’s right, a Gravel. Sweater. Think of it as a casual-fit Merino wool jersey that lacks a zipper, and something you’d actually want to wear off the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-sitting-on-skateboard.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-sitting-on-skateboard.webp\" alt=\"Ornot Merino Gravel Sweater sitting on skateboard\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-sitting-on-skateboard.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-sitting-on-skateboard-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-sitting-on-skateboard-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-sitting-on-skateboard-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-sitting-on-skateboard-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-sitting-on-skateboard-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Ornot)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This good-looking sweater isn’t just for on-the-bike shenanigans; it’s handsome enough for a night out with your significant other as well. It’s made in the USA with deadstock Polartec Power Wool, meaning surplus fabrics from mills and clothing brands that was not used in production.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-sitting-together.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-sitting-together.webp\" alt=\"Ornot Merino Gravel Sweater sitting together\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-sitting-together.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-sitting-together-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-sitting-together-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-sitting-together-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-sitting-together-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-sitting-together-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that means Ornot’s new Gravel Sweater has all of the benefits of a new Merino wool without the need to make up new material. Ornot says the “sweaters’ grid structure locks in warmth when you want it and lets it go when you don’t.” This makes it ideal for layering on long rides, hangin’ out with your pals, or just walkin’ around lookin’ snazzy. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-womens-.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-womens-.webp\" alt=\"Ornot Merino Gravel Sweater womens\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-womens-.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-womens--297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-womens--120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-womens--768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-womens-charcole-back-pocket-.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-womens-charcole-back-pocket-.webp\" alt=\"Ornot Merino Gravel Sweater women's charcole back pocket\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-womens-charcole-back-pocket-.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-womens-charcole-back-pocket--297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-womens-charcole-back-pocket--120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-womens-charcole-back-pocket--768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ornot Gravel Sweater has a cool hidden rear pocket, giving you a place to put a snack, a phone, a wallet, or whatever essentials you see fit. Merino wool is naturally antimicrobial, moisture-wicking, and stays warm when it gets wet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-mens-charcol.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-mens-charcol.webp\" alt=\"Ornot Merino Gravel Sweater mens charcol\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-mens-charcol.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-mens-charcol-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-mens-charcol-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-mens-charcol-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-back-saphire.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-back-saphire.webp\" alt=\"Ornot Merino Gravel Sweater back saphire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-back-saphire.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-back-saphire-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-back-saphire-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-back-saphire-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The sweater is available in both women’s and men’s sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ornot Gravel Sweater Retail &amp; Detail</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $145</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Domestically sourced Polartec Power Wool</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bi-component knit – Durable abrasion-resistant face.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Constructed with bluesign-approved materials </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Temp range from 45-60 degrees and perfect for layering.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shape retention and 4-way stretch for all-day comfort.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>51% recycled poly, 42% wool, 7% spandex (merino wool is placed on the inside)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Concealed 5″x7″ rear zip pocket for snacks, sunglasses, or even a phone.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sewn by hand in the USA.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-last-photo.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-last-photo.webp\" alt=\"Ornot Merino Gravel Sweater last photo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-last-photo.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-last-photo-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-last-photo-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-last-photo-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-last-photo-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ornot-Merino-Gravel-Sweater-last-photo-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.ornotbike.com/\" target=\"_blank\">OrNotBike.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/gravel-sweater-ornot-bicycle/\">It’s Gravel Sweater Weather with the Newest Versatile Piece from Ornot</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"0b8daac77f37b9d5854af028242525721be1b319e0227fabebef1fa5a97e63a2","category":"Cycling"}
