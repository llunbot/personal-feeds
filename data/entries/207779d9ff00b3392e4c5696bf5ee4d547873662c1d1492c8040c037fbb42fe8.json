You can use PS5 and Xbox controllers with the headset, but it doesn’t support third-party grip accessories designed specifically for VR content. And Apple decided not to make any such accessories of its own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s possible that Apple didn’t view Vision Pro as being primarily a gaming device (or that, this being Apple, it simply failed to appreciate the importance of the gaming market) but other, arguably more successful headsets focus on that area more than any other, in terms of branding, content, and hardware support. Sony’s <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/736078/playstation-vr-2.html\">PlayStation VR2</a> is an obvious example of one direction Apple could take if it wanted to improve take-up in the gaming space.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>PlayStation VR2</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1740\" height=\"979\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PlayStation-VR2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"PlayStation VR2\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PlayStation-VR2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1740w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PlayStation-VR2.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PlayStation-VR2.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PlayStation-VR2.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PlayStation-VR2.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PlayStation-VR2.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PlayStation-VR2.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$549.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/PlayStation-VR2-Horizon-Call-of-the-Mountain-Bundle/3333660564\" target=\"_blank\">$349 at  Walmart Electronics</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6542113/pdp\" target=\"_blank\">$349.99 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/playstation-vr2-horizon-call-of-the-mountain-bundle/-/A-88995903\" target=\"_blank\">$349.99 at  Target </a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>And perhaps it will. In the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-12-08/apple-sony-talk-playstation-vr-ps-vr2-hand-controller-support-for-vision-pro\">latest instalment</a> of his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman claims that the company is currently working with Sony to build support for the VR2’s controllers into Vision Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a more complex project than you might think, not least because Sony doesn’t currently sell the controllers on their own: they are only available when bundled with the VR2 itself. For the controllers to be available for Vision Pro owners to buy would require Sony to undertake the logistical work needed to package and ship the accessories as standalone products. Gurman says Apple will sell the controllers in its retail stores, as well through its website… much as it currently sells Sony’s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPNG2ZM/B/sony-playstation-dualsense%E2%84%A2-wireless-controller\">DualSense controller</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if Apple continues to downplay Vision Pro’s focus on gaming, the move could still be beneficial because, as Gurman notes, the VR2 controller could be an excellent way to navigate the headset’s interface without having to depend on the default eye-tracking system. Those who find the interface idiosyncratic and quite challenging may prefer to use Vision Pro in this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, however, adding support for a third-party gaming accessory will not instantly transform Vision Pro’s fortunes. If Apple wants gamers to use its headset, it needs to persuade more developers to make and release games for its platform. And right now, the signs are not promising.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"207779d9ff00b3392e4c5696bf5ee4d547873662c1d1492c8040c037fbb42fe8","category":"Apple"}
