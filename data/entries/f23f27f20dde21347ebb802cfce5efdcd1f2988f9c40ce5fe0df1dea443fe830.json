{"title":"Apple Stores Begin Same-Unit iPhone 15 Repairs as Parts Now Available","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/iphone-15-same-unit-repairs/","date":1698162860000,"content":"For a brief period following the release of new iPhone models, Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers must replace the entire device if a customer requires a repair, as individual parts are not immediately available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Internal-Chassis.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nStarting this week, parts are available for all four iPhone 15 models, allowing Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers to complete same-unit repairs for these devices, according to an internal memo obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>. This includes the back glass, battery, speakers, display, rear camera, and mid-frame.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA whole-unit replacement is still required for repairs involving the Taptic Engine or the main microphone on the iPhone 15 Pro or the iPhone 15 Pro Max, as those parts will not be available until a later time, according to the memo.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll four iPhone 15 models are equipped with removable back glass, allowing technicians to open the devices from both the front and back sides for repairs. This change results in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/17/iphone-15-pro-cracked-glass-repair-fees-lower/\">significantly lower repair fees</a> for iPhone 15 models with cracked back glass for customers without AppleCare+ compared to models without removable back glass. Apple first made this design change with the lower-end iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the U.S., Apple's battery replacement fee is set at $99 for all four iPhone 15 models, which is unchanged from the iPhone 14 series.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo book an iPhone 15 repair appointment, visit <a href=\"https://getsupport.apple.com/\">Apple's Get Support page</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aasp/\">Apple Authorized Service Providers</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15\">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/iphone-15-same-unit-repairs/\">Apple Stores Begin Same-Unit iPhone 15 Repairs as Parts Now Available</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stores-begin-same-unit-iphone-15-repairs-as-parts-now-available.2408534/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f23f27f20dde21347ebb802cfce5efdcd1f2988f9c40ce5fe0df1dea443fe830","category":"Apple"}
