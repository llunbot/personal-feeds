{"title":"Apple Event Next Monday: ‘Unleashed’","link":"https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/10/apple-event-coming-oct-18/","date":1634057810000,"content":"\n<p>Jason Snell, Six Colors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It’s official: there <em>will</em> be another Apple media event this\nfall, and it’s Monday, Oct. 18 at 10 Pacific.</p>\n\n<p>New MacBook Pro models are likely to be the star of the show.\nWe’ll have full coverage on Six Colors, as always. Myke Hurley and\nI will offer post-event coverage after it’s all said and done,\nlive on Relay FM.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The event name is “Unleashed”, and the motif is a take on going into warp drive or hyperspace. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1447956519132151810\">Greg Joswiak, on Twitter</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Unleashed! These next six days are going to speed by.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You don’t need to be Kreskin to predict that new pro Macs powered by high-performance Apple silicon will be the main attraction. It seems like a surefire bet that we’ll see the new 16- and 14-inch MacBook Pros. I hope we see the new full-size iMacs — 30-inch displays, perhaps? — too.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/12/apple-event-unleashed\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"701d85ea7e1805899940ebac99112c2c6c9ba09cda099ef52f7a90c0ec0ae2a1","category":"Tech"}
