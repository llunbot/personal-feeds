An app can support AirPlay 2 by implementing AVFoundation framework APIs, with a four-step process <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/media_playback_and_selection/getting_airplay_2_into_your_app\">outlined on Apple's developer website</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSpotify has also yet to add native support for the HomePod (or its HomePod mini successor), despite Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/22/homepod-third-party-music-services/\">opening up the speaker to third-party music services</a> last year.
