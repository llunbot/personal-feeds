A <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/\">widespread protest</a> is planned for June 12, with hundreds of subreddits planning to go dark for 48 hours.</p>\n<p>Reddit started life as a geeky site, but as it has aged, it has been trying to work more like a traditional social network. Part of that push included the development of a first-party app for mobile devices, but the 17-year-old site <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/07/reddit-launches-its-first-official-apps-for-ios-and-android/\">only launched</a> an official app in 2016.

The popular iOS client Apollo announced it was facing a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/reddits-api-pricing-results-in-shocking-20-million-a-year-bill-for-apollo/\">$20 million-a-year</a> bill. Apollo's developer, Christian Selig, hasn't announced a shutdown but admitted, \"I don't have that kind of money or would even know how to charge it to a credit card.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944464#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944464&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"12901c9d2242bbe0916732ae19221a0ebf5d3763367338ba7afbf015fa8648a1","category":"Tech"}
