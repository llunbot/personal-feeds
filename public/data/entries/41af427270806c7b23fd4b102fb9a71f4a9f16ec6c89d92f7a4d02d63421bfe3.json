Today I am happy to tell you that you can now receive timely, detailed information about releases and updates to AWS via the same, simple mechanism.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Daily Feature Updates</strong></span><br /> Simply subscribe to topic <strong>arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:692768080016:aws-new-feature-updates</strong> using the email protocol and confirm the subscription in the usual way:</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/03/06/relsub_sub_4.png\" alt width=\"1126\" height=\"847\" /></p> \n<p>You will receive daily emails that start off like this, with an introduction and a summary of the update:</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/02/28/wnt_email_top_4.png\" alt width=\"900\" height=\"477\" /></p> \n<p>After the introduction, the email contains a JSON representation of the daily feature updates:</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/02/28/wnt_email_mid_2.png\" alt width=\"900\" height=\"683\" /></p> \n<p>As noted in the message, the JSON content is also available online at URLs that look like <a href=\"https://aws-new-features.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/update/2023-02-27.json\">https://aws-new-features.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/update/2023-02-27.json</a> . You can also edit the date in the URL to access historical data going back up to six months.</p> \n<p>The email message also includes detailed information about changes and additions to managed policies that will be of particular interest to AWS customers who currently manually track and then verify the impact that these changes may have on their security profile. Here’s a sample list of changes (additional permissions) to existing managed policies:</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/03/06/wnt_imp_change_2-1.png\" alt width=\"521\" height=\"252\" /></p> \n<p>And here’s a new managed policy:</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/03/02/wnt_imp_new_1.png\" alt width=\"741\" height=\"120\" /></p> \n<p><span><strong>Even More Information</strong></span><br /> The header of the email contains a link to a treasure trove of additional information. Here are some examples:</p> \n<p><strong>AWS Regions and AWS Services</strong> – A pair of tables. The first one includes a row for each AWS Region and a column for each service, and the second one contains the transposed version:</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/02/28/wnt_aras_1.png\" alt width=\"846\" height=\"368\" /></p> \n<p><strong>AWS Regions and EC2 Instance Types</strong> – Again, a pair of tables. The first one includes a row for each AWS Region and a column for each EC2 instance type, and the second one contains the transposed version:</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/02/28/wnt_arit_1.png\" alt width=\"836\" height=\"382\" /></p> \n<p>The <strong>EC2 Instance Types Configuration</strong> link leads to detailed information about each instance type:</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/02/28/wnt_itco_2.png\" alt width=\"796\" height=\"378\" /></p> \n<p>Each page also includes a link to the same information in JSON form. For example (EC2 Instance Types Configuration), starts like this:</p> \n<div> \n <pre><code>{\n    \"a1.2xlarge\": {\n        \"af-south-1\": \"-\",\n        \"ap-east-1\": \"-\",\n        \"ap-northeast-1\": \"a1.2xlarge\",\n        \"ap-northeast-2\": \"-\",\n        \"ap-northeast-3\": \"-\",\n        \"ap-south-1\": \"a1.2xlarge\",\n        \"ap-south-2\": \"-\",\n        \"ap-southeast-1\": \"a1.2xlarge\",\n        \"ap-southeast-2\": \"a1.2xlarge\",\n        \"ap-southeast-3\": \"-\",\n        \"ap-southeast-4\": \"-\",\n        \"ca-central-1\": \"-\",\n        \"eu-central-1\": \"a1.2xlarge\",\n        \"eu-central-2\": \"-\",\n        \"eu-north-1\": \"-\",\n        \"eu-south-1\": \"-\",\n        \"eu-south-2\": \"-\",\n        \"eu-west-1\": \"a1.2xlarge\",\n        \"eu-west-2\": \"-\",\n        \"eu-west-3\": \"-\",\n        \"me-central-1\": \"-\",\n        \"me-south-1\": \"-\",\n        \"sa-east-1\": \"-\",\n        \"us-east-1\": \"a1.2xlarge\",\n        \"us-east-2\": \"a1.2xlarge\",\n        \"us-gov-east-1\": \"-\",\n        \"us-gov-west-1\": \"-\",\n        \"us-west-1\": \"-\",\n        \"us-west-2\": \"a1.2xlarge\"\n    },</code></pre> \n</div> \n<p>Other information includes:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>VPC Endpoints</li> \n <li>AWS Services Integrated with Service Quotas</li> \n <li>Amazon SageMaker Instance Types</li> \n <li>RDS DB Engine Versions</li> \n <li>Amazon Nimble Instance Types</li> \n <li>Amazon MSK Apache Kafka Versions</li> \n</ul> \n<p><span><strong>Information Sources</strong></span><br /> The information is pulled from multiple public sources, cross-checked, and then issued.

Where possible, it also provides information about GovCloud regions; this currently includes EC2 Instance Types, SageMaker Instance Types, and Amazon Nimble Instance Types.</p> \n<p><strong>Region Mappings</strong> – The internal data that drives all of the information related to AWS Regions is updated once a day if there are applicable new features, and also when new AWS Regions are enabled.</p> \n<p><strong>Updates</strong> – On days when there are no updates, there will not be an email notification.</p> \n<p><strong>Usage</strong> – Similar to the updates on the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new\">What’s New page</a> and the associated RSS feed, the updates are provided for informational purposes, and you still need to do your own evaluation and testing before deploying to production.</p> \n<p><strong>??? </strong>–</p> \n<p>— <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffbarr\">Jeff</a>;</p>","author":"Jeff Barr","siteTitle":"AWS News Blog","siteHash":"6093e072e4117ec22616e844cb857d03ca62c57a411a8affc77cb5e8b6b15bf6","entryHash":"41af427270806c7b23fd4b102fb9a71f4a9f16ec6c89d92f7a4d02d63421bfe3","category":"Tech"}
