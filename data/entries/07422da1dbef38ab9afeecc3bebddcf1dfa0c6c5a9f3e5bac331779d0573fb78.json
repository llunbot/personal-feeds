Packed to the gills with 23,211 enemies (often in extremely claustrophobic corridors), the level <a href=\"https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/87400-what-is-the-largest-known-doomdoom-2-map-in-existence/?tab=comments#comment-1592872\">quickly gained a reputation</a> in <a href=\"https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/113456-the-hardest-wad/?tab=comments#comment-2110127\">the classic <em>Doom</em> player community</a> as being <a href=\"https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/113456-the-hardest-wad/?tab=comments#comment-2110258\">one of the hardest ever constructed</a>.</p>\n<p>That reputation didn't stop <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@coincident\">classic FPS streamer Coincident</a>, who has been grinding away at the \"Okuplok slaughter map\" in some form or another for years. And over the weekend, Coincident became the first player to defeat every enemy and complete the map in a single segment during <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2438170031?t=0h10m8s\">a livestreamed marathon run</a> that clocked in at just over six hours.</p>\n<h2>A long time coming</h2>\n<p>To be clear, this isn't the first time the Okuplok slaughter map has been completed in any form. In 2023, Coincident managed to take it down in a single segment run <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PP6iqrgIM8\">on the much easier \"I'm too young to die\" difficulty</a>, which halves the damage taken and doubles the ammo provided. At the time, Coincident estimated that an Ultra Violence run on the same level would be \"eight times more difficult,\" thanks in large part to randomized damage that could end a run after a single mistake.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/12-years-six-hours-and-23211-demons-defeating-one-of-doom-2s-hardest-maps/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/12-years-six-hours-and-23211-demons-defeating-one-of-doom-2s-hardest-maps/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"07422da1dbef38ab9afeecc3bebddcf1dfa0c6c5a9f3e5bac331779d0573fb78","category":"Tech"}
