These next six days are going to speed by.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You don’t need to be Kreskin to predict that new pro Macs powered by high-performance Apple silicon will be the main attraction. It seems like a surefire bet that we’ll see the new 16- and 14-inch MacBook Pros. I hope we see the new full-size iMacs — 30-inch displays, perhaps? — too. My other hope: MacBook Pros in black or near-black.</p>\n\n<p>The slightly weird thing about the event is that it’s on a Monday — Apple generally holds events on Tuesdays. Looking at my notes, I think the last time Apple held an event on a Monday (excepting WWDC keynotes, which of course are always on Monday mornings) was <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/03/21Apple-Introduces-iPhone-SE-The-Most-Powerful-Phone-with-a-Four-inch-Display/\">the original iPhone SE event</a>, which was on Monday, 21 March 2016. They might have held that one a day early <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/apple-to-debut-new-ipad-smaller-iphone-at-march-15-event\">because the next day was Apple’s courtroom showdown with the FBI regarding the San Bernardino gun massacre</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Why hold next week’s event on Monday instead of Tuesday? My only spitball: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement\">because Google already announced its fall Pixel event for Tuesday</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/12/apple-event-unleashed\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"701d85ea7e1805899940ebac99112c2c6c9ba09cda099ef52f7a90c0ec0ae2a1","category":"Tech"}
