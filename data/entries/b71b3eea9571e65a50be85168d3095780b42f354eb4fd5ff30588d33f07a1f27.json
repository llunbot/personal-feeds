The new game, titled <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em>, looks a lot like <em>Stardew Valley</em>, which means it's a refreshingly lovely homage to all things SNES and Squaresoft.</p>\n<p>As Barone's first new video game since <em>SV</em>'s 2016 launch, <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> currently doesn't have a release date estimate of any kind. To avoid being \"tied down to any particular concept of what the game is\" before its eventual launch, Barone has not yet finalized <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em>'s gameplay systems, either. <em>HC</em>'s reveal came alongside a <a href=\"https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/faq/\">lengthy FAQ</a>, whose site has been pounded by fans' immediate interest in the new game, and it clarifies that the game revolves around \"a chocolatier living in a haunted castle\" who must \"gather rare ingredients, make delicious chocolates, and sell them in a chocolate shop.\"</p>\n      <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-10153-980x551.png\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          Sweet plant-based nectar.

(There's also <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/stardew-valley-the-board-game-a-loving-production-but-a-mixed-review-from-grandpa/\">a board game version</a>.) Like that game, Barone suggests that <em>HC</em> will be an entirely self-made project (programming, art, music, and more), with outside help only coming once the game is finalized and needs help with language translations and ports to other platforms. (As of press time, Barone is only committing to a launch on PC, with other platform announcements to come later.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806545#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806545&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b71b3eea9571e65a50be85168d3095780b42f354eb4fd5ff30588d33f07a1f27","category":"Tech"}
