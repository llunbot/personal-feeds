However, while the new chip brought a tremendous speed boost, the switch to Apple silicon also took away the ability to upgrade the memory and graphics after purchase.  That means the only real benefit of the Mac Pro is expansion slots for audio and video I/O, networking, and storage cards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at the very least, you’d think the engineers would at least use them at Apple Park. After all, they have access to any Mac they want, yet they opted for Mac Studios instead of Mac Pros. And it’s hard to blame them. The Mac Studio is small enough to fit under a display and has a pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports and an SDXC card slot card slot on the front for easy access. (Though to be fair, the Mac Pro does have two Thunderbolt 4 ports on the top of the case.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s hard not to wonder how long the Mac Pro will be made. It was a niche machine before the Mac Studio came along and now there are fewer buyers then ever—if any. After all, even Apple doesn’t want one.</p>\n\nMac</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"919878e6fd27adffe32ad45a7cae729a52cb28c354fa821ec7c032666a021c29","category":"Apple"}
