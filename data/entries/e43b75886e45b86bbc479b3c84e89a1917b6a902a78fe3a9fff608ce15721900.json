The new Mac Studio ships with macOS Sequoia 15.3.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MacStudio/comments/1ic8lfc/macos_153_adds_low_power_mode_to_mac_studio/\">few Reddit users said</a> macOS Sequoia 15.3 enabled Low Power Mode on the previous-generation Mac Studio with the M2 Max chip, and presumably on M2 Ultra configurations too. This is not reflected in Apple's support document.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn any case, Low Power Mode on the Mac Studio is fairly new.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs obvious as it may sound, Apple's support document also confirms that the Mac Studio still <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/11/mac-studio-still-lacks-high-power-mode/\">lacks High Power Mode</a> for additional cooling.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's document <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/101613\">has a list of Macs</a> that support Low Power Mode with reduced fan noise.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/low-power-mode/\">Low Power Mode</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio\">Mac Studio (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237\">Mac Studio</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/new-mac-studio-supports-low-power-mode/\">New Mac Studio Supports Low Power Mode With Two Benefits</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-mac-studio-supports-low-power-mode-with-two-benefits.2452939/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e43b75886e45b86bbc479b3c84e89a1917b6a902a78fe3a9fff608ce15721900","category":"Apple"}
