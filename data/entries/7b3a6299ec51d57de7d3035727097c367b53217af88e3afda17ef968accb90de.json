That means anyone that fails to remember their passcode will need to bring their Vision Pro in to Apple to have it wiped.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to <em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/06/visionos-1-1-beta-reset-password/\">9to5Mac</a></em>, there is code in the ‌visionOS‌ 1.1 beta that allows the Vision Pro to be erased without the need to bring it to an Apple retail location.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is a new system alert that lets the Vision Pro be reset after a certain number of failed attempts to enter a passcode.\r<br />\n<blockquote>This Apple Vision Pro is in security lockout. You can wait and try your passcode again, or you can erase and reset this Apple Vision Pro now.</blockquote>\r<br />\nResetting the Vision Pro will wipe all content from the device, but as it has Activation Lock, it will not be able to be used by anyone except for the original owner with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a> password used to set it up. After being wiped, the Vision Pro can be set up as new again with a new passcode added.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/visionos-1-1-beta-vision-pro-reset-option/\">visionOS 1.1 Beta Adds Option to Reset Vision Pro In Case of Forgotten Passcode</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/visionos-1-1-beta-adds-option-to-reset-vision-pro-in-case-of-forgotten-passcode.2418691/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7b3a6299ec51d57de7d3035727097c367b53217af88e3afda17ef968accb90de","category":"Apple"}
