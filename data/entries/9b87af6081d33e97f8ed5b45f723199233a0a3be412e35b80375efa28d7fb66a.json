In the spot, a man catches a giant fish and while he attempts to wrangle it, he is able to use Double Tap to trigger the Apple Watch to take a photo on a connected <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nThe Apple Watch has a dedicated Camera Remote app, and when opened, it activates the camera on the ‌iPhone‌. Focusing can be done with a tap on the display, and an image can be captured with either the timer button in the Apple Watch app or the Double Tap gesture.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDouble Tap is available on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. It allows several Apple Watch functions to be activated with one hand by tapping a thumb and index finger together twice. The feature uses sensors in the Apple Watch to detect minute movements and blood flow to recognize the gesture.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will likely use this short ad on its social media networks and YouTube. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/\">Apple Ads</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/07/apple-watch-double-tap/\">Apple Watch Double Tap Feature Highlighted in Latest Apple Ad</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-double-tap-feature-highlighted-in-latest-apple-ad.2428410/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9b87af6081d33e97f8ed5b45f723199233a0a3be412e35b80375efa28d7fb66a","category":"Apple"}
