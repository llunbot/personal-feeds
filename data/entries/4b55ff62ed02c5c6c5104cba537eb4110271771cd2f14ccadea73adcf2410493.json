The number of employees to be laid off is: 100. <a href=\"https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/01/17/youtube-corporate-restructuring/\">Tubefilter</a> was the first to report the news. This is the third Google layoff announcement in eight days (the other two were at <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/google-lays-off-hundreds-more-employees-strips-google-assistant-features/\">Google Assistant/Hardware</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2024/01/google-lays-off-hundreds-more-as-ad-division-switches-to-ai-powered-sales/\">Google Ads</a>) and the 10th Google layoff announcement we've covered in the past 12 months. It feels like we should be doing this via some kind of form by now.</p>\n<p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai says to expect more layoffs. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/17/24042417/google-layoffs-2024-internal-employee-memo-sundar-pichai\">The Verge</a> got ahold of an internal memo from Pichai to Google's remaining employees on January 10, telling them to brace for \"tough choices\" in the future and that \"to be upfront, some teams will continue to make specific resource allocation decisions throughout the year where needed, and some roles may be impacted.\" Last year Google cut 12,000 jobs in January and continued to make smaller additional cuts all year. Pichai told his employees that this year, \"these role eliminations are not at the scale of last yearâ€™s reductions, and will not touch every team.\"</p>\n<p>The January 10 date of the memo means Googlers got a heads up about the Google Assistant, Hardware, Google Ads, and YouTube layoffs, but no one knows when the layoffs will stop. Making investors happy is a big factor in all these layoffs, so if you're interested in the Wall Street perspective on Google's headcount, back in March 2023, <a href=\"https://www.tcifund.com/files/corporateengageement/alphabet/20th%20January%202023.pdf\">activist investor</a> Christopher Hohn of TCI Fund Management wanted to see Pichai cut <em>another </em>25,000 people after the 12,000 original layoffs. Hohn wants to see Alphabet/Google go back to 150,000 employees, which was the company headcount at the end of 2021.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996984#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996984&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4b55ff62ed02c5c6c5104cba537eb4110271771cd2f14ccadea73adcf2410493","category":"Tech"}
