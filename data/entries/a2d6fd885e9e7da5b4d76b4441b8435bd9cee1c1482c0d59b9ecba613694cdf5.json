Altman is a major investor in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/humane-ai-pin/\">the Humane AI pin</a>, a wearable AI device that does not have a screen, so it's possible he will create a similar product with Ive.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNews of a possible partnership between Ive and Altman <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/jony-ive-openai-design-ai-hardware/\">first surfaced last fall</a>, but talks were in the early stages and nothing was official then. Ive and Altman's unnamed startup is now sourcing funds from major venture capitalists, with Ive aiming to raise up to $1 billion in funding.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOpenAI could own a piece of the business, and the duo has also been in talks with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son. Potential investors include Thrive Capital, an OpenAI investor, and Emerson Collective, a venture capital firm and philanthropic organization founded by Laurene Powell Jobs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIve <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/06/27/jony-ive-leaving-apple/\">left his role</a> as Apple design chief in 2019, and while he still worked with the Cupertino company as a consultant for several years after through his firm LoveFrom, Ive and Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/12/apple-ends-jony-ive-partnership/\">stopped working together</a> entirely in 2022.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/\">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jony-ive/\">Jony Ive</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/\">OpenAI</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/jony-ive-sam-altman-ai-device/\">Jony Ive and OpenAI's Sam Altman Seeking Funding for Personal AI Device</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/jony-ive-and-openais-sam-altman-seeking-funding-for-personal-ai-device.2423629/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a2d6fd885e9e7da5b4d76b4441b8435bd9cee1c1482c0d59b9ecba613694cdf5","category":"Apple"}
