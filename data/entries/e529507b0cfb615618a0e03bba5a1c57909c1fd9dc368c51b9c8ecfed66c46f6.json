That is up from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/19/new-apple-tv-and-10th-generation-ipad-4gb-ram/\">4GB of RAM in the previous-generation iPad 10</a> with the A14 Bionic chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPhone 15, and iPhone 15 Plus models with the A16 chip also have 6GB of RAM, but the A16 chip has slightly reduced CPU and GPU specifications in the new entry-level iPad, so it was not entirely clear until now if the device would also have 6GB of RAM, or stick with the same 4GB as the previous model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnfortunately, the new entry-level iPad lacks support for Apple Intelligence, which currently requires at least 8GB of RAM.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nStill, increased RAM contributes to faster performance, particularly for multitasking.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new iPad can be pre-ordered now, and it is set to launch on Wednesday, March 12.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/new-ipad-with-a16-chip-has-more-ram/\">New Entry-Level iPad With A16 Chip Has More RAM Than iPad 10</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-entry-level-ipad-with-a16-chip-has-more-ram-than-ipad-10.2452087/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e529507b0cfb615618a0e03bba5a1c57909c1fd9dc368c51b9c8ecfed66c46f6","category":"Apple"}
