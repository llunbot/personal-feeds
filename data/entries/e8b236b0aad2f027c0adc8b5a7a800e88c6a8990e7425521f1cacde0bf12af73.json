The space agency named the two crew members who will launch on a Crew Dragon mission set to lift off no earlier than September 24 to the International Space Station.</p>\n<p>NASA astronaut Nick Hague will serve as the mission's commander, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov will serve as mission specialist.

They flew to the station in June aboard Boeing's Starliner vehicle, which has been deemed unsafe for them to return in.</p>\n<p>Wilmore and Williams will join the Crew-9 increment on board the space station and fly back to Earth with Hague and Gorbunov next February.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046482#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046482&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e8b236b0aad2f027c0adc8b5a7a800e88c6a8990e7425521f1cacde0bf12af73","category":"Tech"}
