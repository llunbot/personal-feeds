Let’s say also that\nyou’re not crazy. This is a reasonable description of many of the\nphysicists working in the field of nuclear fusion. In order to\nreach this goal, they had to find a way to heat matter to\ntemperatures hotter than the center of the sun, so hot that atoms\nessentially melt into a cloud of charged particles known as\nplasma; they did that. They had to conceive of and build\ncontainers that could hold those plasmas; they did that, too, by\nmaking “bottles” out of strong magnetic fields. When those\nmagnetic bottles leaked — because, as one scientist explained,\ntrying to contain plasma in a magnetic bottle is like trying to\nwrap a jelly in twine — they had to devise further ingenious\nsolutions, and, again and again, they did. Over decades, in the\npursuit of nuclear fusion, scientists and engineers built giant\nmetal doughnuts and Gehryesque twisted coils, they “pinched”\nplasmas with lasers, and they constructed fusion devices in\ngarages. For thirty-six years, they have been planning and\nbuilding an experimental fusion device in Provence. And yet\ncommercially viable nuclear-fusion energy has always remained just\na bit farther on.
