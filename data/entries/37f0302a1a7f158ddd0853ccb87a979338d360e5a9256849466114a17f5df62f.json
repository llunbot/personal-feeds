Google says that this is useful for comparing reviews, prices, and other elements of multiple products when deciding what to purchase.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle is also introducing a natural language search option for Chrome browsing history, allowing Chrome users to quickly find a site that they visited in the past with a phrase like \"What was that ice cream shop I looked at last week?\" Conversational search is optional, and can be turned on or off in the Chrome settings. It will not include data from incognito mode.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe AI-powered Google Lens feature will be available with the latest Chrome update that's rolling out over the next few days, while the other two features will be available in the next few weeks. Tab compare and the browser search option will both be rolled out in the U.S. to begin with.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chrome/\">Chrome</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/01/google-lens-ai-chrome-desktop/\">Google Adds AI-Powered Google Lens and Tab Compare to Chrome for Desktop</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-adds-ai-powered-google-lens-and-tab-compare-to-chrome-for-desktop.2432693/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"37f0302a1a7f158ddd0853ccb87a979338d360e5a9256849466114a17f5df62f","category":"Apple"}
