Armed with newer tech, like an OLED panel with up to a 90 Hz refresh rate and 11th-gen Intel and AMD Ryzen 5000-series mobile CPUs, the Asus Vivobook Pro 14 and 15 OLED laptops announced today also have some interesting choices for graphics: either the current-gen RTX 3050 or the GTX 1650, a card that first debuted two generations ago.</p>\n<p>The mobile GTX 1650 originally came out in 2019 with GDDR5 memory. But in 2020, as current-generation cards were virtually impossible to find at anywhere near MSRP, Nvidia released a new variant with GDDR6 memory, boosting bandwidth from 128 to 192 Gbps. At the time, Nvidia told <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidias-gtx-1650-gets-gddr6-because-the-industry-is-running-out-of-gddr5/\">PC Gamer</a> that \"the industry is running out of GDDR5.\"</p>\n<p>Asus' new Vivobooks employ the Max-Q version of the GTX 1650, allowing the 14-inch laptop to measure just 0.76 inches (19.25 mm) thick and the 15-inch version 0.74 inches (18.9 mm). The trim GPU carries 4GB of GDDR6 memory and is said to be <a href=\"https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-gtx-1650-max-q.c3383\">specced</a> to hit a clock speed of up to 1,245 MHz with a total graphics power (TGP) of 35W. For comparison, the RTX 3050 is only available in the 15-inch version Vivobook Pro OLED with 4GB of GDDR6 and up to 1,500 MHz at 35W (50W with Dynamic Boost).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813061#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813061&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"85e392be1a08a8b5b624f9df25174841446049075e7a602a0ca5ef5a19728b17","category":"Tech"}
