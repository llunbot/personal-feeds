{"title":"How to schedule an Apple Vision Pro demo","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2227173/how-to-schedule-an-apple-vision-pro-demo.html","date":1707146628000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>With prices starting at $3,499, the Apple Vision Pro is too expensive for a lot of people. But anyone can try out the Vision Pro and it won’t cost you a thing, except your time. If you’re interested, you can now <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/retail/instore-shopping-session/session-selection/?topic=visionpro&amp;resToken=1a95b0b1-e2bb-a081-d145-8b18e30ebdde&amp;xcust=1-1-2227173-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">schedule a Vision Pro demo online</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Instore Shopping Sessions section of Apple’s website has a signup form to schedule a demo. It describes what you should expect in the demo: 30 minutes of a one-on-one session during which a specialist will do a fitting (including lenses for people who wear glasses) and you get to “experience the magic of spatial computing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The form recommends several Apple Stores based on your location, along with a date for the next available appointment. After you pick a location and a date/time, you’ll be asked for your contact information. Apparently, you must be 13 years of age or older to participate; Apple asks you to confirm this, or you can’t reserve the timeslot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Demos can also be booked in-person at the Apple Store. You likely won’t be able to simply walk in and get a demo without an appointment; you’ll probably need to schedule for a later time. Apple does have the Vision Pro on display but during my visit to my local Apple Store this past weekend, the display headsets were not powered on, and they were mounted to stands so they couldn’t be tried on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In case you’re wondering if the demo experience is like visiting a car dealership where the salesperson is constantly pressuring you to buy, that doesn’t seem to be the case. During my recent Apple Store visit, salespeople were happy to chat about Vision Pro, but they never engaged in any hard sell tactics, nor did they simply ask if you wanted to buy one. Macworld’s Michael Simon, who <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2220040/vision-pro-experience-eye-tracking-eyesight-spatial-video-display.html\">describes his Apple Store Vision Pro demo</a>, also wasn’t pressured to buy–the salesperson asked about the experience and left it at that. Your experience may vary based on that store’s goals and the salespeople involved, but there doesn’t seem to be an order from Apple corporate to pressure customers into buying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information, check out our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-vision-pro-release-date-headset-specs-price.html\">Apple Vision Pro superguide</a>.</p>\n\nVirtual Reality, Wearables</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"916236a2d77acd5edaaf19ec101638ee3074d75ce6538a41e041651e1606ccc3","category":"Apple"}
