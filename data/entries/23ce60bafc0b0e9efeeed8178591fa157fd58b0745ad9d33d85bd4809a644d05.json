He <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/18/next-macbook-air-faster-apple-silicon-chip/\">previously mentioned</a> that a next-generation entry-level MacBook Pro would contain the same ‌M2‌ chip as the next-generation ‌MacBook Air‌, featuring the same number of CPU cores as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip, up to 10 graphics cores, and improved performance, but this is the first time that the machine has been mentioned in over half a year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe introduction of Apple's latest high-end MacBook Pro models, which feature larger displays, scrapped the Touch Bar, and added more ports, seems to have left the entry-level MacBook Pro in something of an odd position in the Mac lineup, leading to speculation that it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/26/apple-could-discontinue-13-inch-macbook-pro/\">could be discontinued</a> and replaced with a high-end version of the ‌MacBook Air‌, but Gurman's reaffirmation suggests that a new entry-level MacBook Pro is still on the way for 2022.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDetails about the new machine are unclear, but there are significant questions around how the new entry-level MacBook Pro will take the middle ground between the new ‌M2‌ ‌MacBook Air‌ and the current high-end MacBook Pro, and whether aspects such as the Touch Bar will remain.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRefreshes of the 24-inch ‌iMac‌ and high-end MacBook Pro were noticeably absent from Gurman's list of expectations for 2022. While these machines were updated this year, their absence from Gurman's list could add clout to the theory that Apple is not planning to update its Apple silicon Macs annually.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBeyond the Mac, Gurman mentioned that he also expects to see an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a> with 5G, new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> earbuds, and the introduction of Apple's first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/\">mixed augmented and virtual reality headset</a> in 2022.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">13\" MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">bloomberg.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro\">Mac Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-pro.1\">Mac Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/05/apple-planning-five-new-macs-for-2022/\">Apple Planning Five New Macs for 2022, Including Entry-Level MacBook Pro Refresh</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-planning-five-new-macs-for-2022-including-entry-level-macbook-pro-refresh.2326289/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=07NIu78MPKI:er5y3B0BcUw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=07NIu78MPKI:er5y3B0BcUw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"23ce60bafc0b0e9efeeed8178591fa157fd58b0745ad9d33d85bd4809a644d05","category":"Apple"}
