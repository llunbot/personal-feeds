There’s also a new generation of GC contenders coming through, which we’ll get to later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can anyone stop SD Worx? </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230725TDFFAZ1077-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cyclists in yellow and white laughing\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230725TDFFAZ1077-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230725TDFFAZ1077-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230725TDFFAZ1077-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230725TDFFAZ1077-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230725TDFFAZ1077-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230725TDFFAZ1077-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230725TDFFAZ1077-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230725TDFFAZ1077-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230725TDFFAZ1077-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez.jpg 1500w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Women’s cycling was dominated by one super-team in 2023, with SD Worx – home to Vollering, Lotte Kopecky, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/marlen-reusser\" target=\"_blank\">Marlen Reusser</a>, Lorena Wiebes and more – winning 11 stage races and 15 Classics, overpowering other teams with their strength in depth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team won four of eight stages of the Tour de France with four different riders, showcasing their superiority in the mountains, on the flat, and in the time-trials. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one-day racing the team holds the trump card of Classics specialist and green jersey winner Lotte Kopecky – called the ‘Wout van Aert of women’s cycling’ by <em>L’Équipe</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She even mounted a GC challenge at the Tour, producing a stunning performance on the Tourmalet and in the final time-trial to finish second overall behind Vollering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like all super-teams – Team Sky in the 2010s springs to mind – SD Worx has been involved in its fair share of controversy this year, ruffling feathers when Vollering drafted behind the team car after a flat tyre on Stage 5 of the Tour, receiving a 20-second time penalty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It didn’t change the overall result in the end, but <em>directeur sportif</em> Danny Stam slammed the UCI for the decision and was then banned from the race for dangerous driving and backchat to the governing body. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also drama within the team at Strade Bianche, when Vollering and Kopecky sprinted against each other for the win, which seemed to make things very awkward afterwards. With Vollering able to win the Classics races in which Kopecky specialises and Kopecky able to challenge for overall victory in the biggest stage race – not to mention Reusser winning stage races of her own and Wiebes wanting Kopecky’s green jersey – will they be able to maintain team cohesion?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attention is sure to be on them next year as they eye further dominance – and aim to stay out of trouble. With other teams closing in at the top, women’s road racing has never been more competitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The next generation of elite riders</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230727TDFFAZ0051-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"three cyclists in pink and orange hug\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230727TDFFAZ0051-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230727TDFFAZ0051-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230727TDFFAZ0051-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230727TDFFAZ0051-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230727TDFFAZ0051-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230727TDFFAZ0051-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230727TDFFAZ0051-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230727TDFFAZ0051-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230727TDFFAZ0051-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux.jpg 1500w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>2023 saw several young and U23 riders coming up through the ranks and challenging at the top end of races. Especially after Van Vleuten’s retirement, these younger talents will have even more room to shine next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One standout from this year was Canyon-SRAM’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ricarda-bauernfeind-cyclist\" target=\"_blank\">Ricarda Bauernfeind</a>, who became the youngest-ever stage winner at the Tour de France Femmes aged 23. She soloed to victory on Stage 5 from a long-range attack, which even heavyweights Reusser and Liane Lippert couldn’t rein in before the finish. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon-SRAM have stacked their roster with more up-and-coming young riders like Antonia Niedermaier, who won a mountain stage ahead of Van Vleuten at the 2023 Giro – her first WorldTour level event – before she was forced to abandon after a crash the next day. She was second overall and leading the young rider classification at that point, so it’ll be great to see what she can achieve in better circumstances next year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another young climber to watch is Lidl-Trek’s Gaia Realini, a mountain domestique for Elisa Longo Borghini and a GC contender in her own right. She almost won the UAE Tour ahead of Longo Borghini and was third at both the Giro and Vuelta, where she also claimed the polka dot jersey. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brit <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/anna-shackley-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">Anna Shackley</a>, who rides for SD Worx, has mainly been a domestique at elite level – unsurprising given the strength of her team – but had a great year in U23 races and classifications, placing second at this year’s Tour de l’Avenir and European road race, and third in the World Championships Road Race. Shackley turns 23 in May, so will be looking to take the next step at the top level in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/shirin-van-anrooij-cyclist\" target=\"_blank\">Shirin van Anrooij</a> is another to watch, stepping up from winning best young rider at the Tour in 2022 to win her first major race at Trofeo Alfredo Binda this year before placing third at Amstel Gold – behind only Vollering and Kopecky.

British Cycling alleges organiser SweetSpot owes £700,000 in unpaid rights fees, a financial shortfall that would have a drastic impact on its ability to put on both its major races. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond problems of funding for an increasingly professional scene, women’s cycling continues to be dogged by age-old issues of sexism and coverage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UCI came under fire at the end of last year for failing to provide TV coverage of the women’s event in its Gravel World Championships. This, despite an all-star field – won by Niewiadoma in her first gravel race – significant hype from fans, and the fact that it <em>did</em> cover the men’s elite race. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Women’s cycling is increasingly professional and going from strength to strength. But when even the governing body can’t secure streaming deals or get behind the sport it shows it still has a long way to go. Let’s hope for better in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>British hopefuls to watch out for </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/anna-shackley-tour-de-lavenir-femmes-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"cyclist on podium with trophy and two old men either side\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/anna-shackley-tour-de-lavenir-femmes-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/anna-shackley-tour-de-lavenir-femmes-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/anna-shackley-tour-de-lavenir-femmes-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/anna-shackley-tour-de-lavenir-femmes-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/anna-shackley-tour-de-lavenir-femmes-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/anna-shackley-tour-de-lavenir-femmes-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/anna-shackley-tour-de-lavenir-femmes-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/anna-shackley-tour-de-lavenir-femmes-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/anna-shackley-tour-de-lavenir-femmes.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Tour de l'Avenir Femmes</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>2023 was a bumper year for Britain’s female cyclists, whose ranks have been bolstered by some new additions moving up from the junior circuit. And with the Olympics looming there’s never been a better time to be on Brit-watch…  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>DSM-Firmenich’s Pfeiffer Georgi was among the very best in the spring Classics, winning her first WorldTour race at Brugge-De Panne and finishing firmly in the mix at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Paris-Roubaix and Amstel Gold. She capped that off by regaining her British road race title and finishing fourth at the European Championships in September – barely behind SD Worx trio Mischa Bredewold, Vollering and Kopecky – and was in contention until right at the end. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jumbo-Visma rider Anna Henderson finished eighth in that, attacking along with Georgi, but her highlight was finishing second in the Euro time-trial behind only Reusser. Henderson’s only win of the season was the team time-trial at the Vuelta but she was consistently strong in 2023 with multiple top tens in the Classics and podiums in the GC of both the Baloise Ladies Tour and Simac Ladies Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former world road race winner <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/lizzie-deignan-cyclist\" target=\"_blank\">Lizzie Deignan</a> returned from the birth of her second child to support her Lidl-Trek team throughout the summer, and had big results herself finishing sixth in the World Championships Road Race and third overall at the RideLondon Classique. She’s another strong contender on women’s cycling’s other super-team if she can get back to her best. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multi-discipline talent <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/zoe-backstedt-cyclist\" target=\"_blank\">Zoe Bäckstedt</a> will look to build on her first pro season and starry junior results having switched from EF Education-TIBCO-SVB to Canyon-SRAM just in time for the cyclocross season, where she’s looking for her first elite win in Europe this winter. Watch out for her development in the spring, where she’ll have help from team DS, dad Magnus Bäckstedt. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And teenage sensation and junior Tour of Flanders and Trofeo Alfredo Binda winner Cat Ferguson has signed as a stagiaire at Movistar from August 2024 and will move into more senior racing over the course of next season. Aged just 17, she’s another of Britain’s stars of the future. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/2024-women-pro-cycling-preview\">5 key storylines for the 2024 women’s pro cycling season</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"fclifford","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"e601ee47b6d6c3a9c8c251bd50ee3e26509f95bf320e8e7244c01df79aade98b","category":"Cycling"}
