It has the modern aero tube shapes, lightweight frame, and stealth routing we want, but puts us in a more comfortable position for crushing miles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is to put the rider in the best position for them rather than put them on a race bike and try to make it fit. Here’s where the idea comes from:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-bike-fit-diagrams-and-comparison.jpg\"><img width=\"2420\" height=\"2122\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-bike-fit-diagrams-and-comparison.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-bike-fit-diagrams-and-comparison.jpg 2420w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-bike-fit-diagrams-and-comparison-297x260.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-bike-fit-diagrams-and-comparison-800x701.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-bike-fit-diagrams-and-comparison-120x105.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-bike-fit-diagrams-and-comparison-768x673.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-bike-fit-diagrams-and-comparison-1536x1347.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-bike-fit-diagrams-and-comparison-2048x1796.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This gist of these charts is this: Mass market bikes’ fits are skewing away from what works at the extremes, and frames have very little overlap between sizes that could leave some riders having to take more extreme measures to get comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pearson’s size range, however, has lots of overlap, which may seem counterintuitive at first. But, how many times have you been between sizes? And how many times have you had to choose a frame that was too small or too big and then make it work? I have, and it’s not ideal.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-bike-geometry-chart.jpg\"><img width=\"1944\" height=\"878\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-bike-geometry-chart.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-bike-geometry-chart.jpg 1944w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-bike-geometry-chart-297x134.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-bike-geometry-chart-800x361.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-bike-geometry-chart-120x54.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-bike-geometry-chart-768x347.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-bike-geometry-chart-1536x694.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They say their five sizes will fit about 85% of riders, and they offer custom and other models for those on the outskirts. Compare the Forge’s geometry chart to what you’re riding now and you’ll probably find that it (the Forge) has a much shorter reach and sits just a bit higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-road-bike-1.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1155\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-road-bike-1.jpg\" alt=\"pearson forge road bike shown from an angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-road-bike-1.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-road-bike-1-297x191.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-road-bike-1-800x513.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-road-bike-1-120x77.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-road-bike-1-768x493.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-road-bike-1-1536x986.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>BTW, Pearson isn’t a brand that’s sprung up to challenge the status quo with new ideas around geo. They’ve been in business since 1860 and claim to be one of the oldest continuously operating bike brands. Now helmed by the fifth generation of Pearsons, the brand has been making bikes for well more than a century.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Forge is made with Toray carbon fiber and weighs in at 890g (size 3). Aero profiles across the frame keep it fast, and they say it’s plenty stiff where it needs to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-road-bike-2.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-road-bike-2.jpg\" alt=\"pearson forge road bike shown from rear angle and front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-road-bike-2.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-road-bike-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-road-bike-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-road-bike-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-road-bike-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pearson-forge-road-bike-2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Specs include a T47 threaded bottom bracket, full internal cable-routing, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ceramicspeed-slt-to-bring-solid-lubrication-technology-to-headsets-pivot-bearings-for-all/\" target=\"_blank\">CeramicSpeed SLT headset bearings</a>, and 700×35 tire clearance (32mm with fenders attached to the hidden mounts).
