However, the name in the source code could be a placeholder, so there is no guarantee one way or the other yet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBlass also shared a purported image of the new iPhone SE, and the device has a Dynamic Island instead of a notch. So far, the Dynamic Island is available on the iPhone 14 Pro models, all four iPhone 15 models, and all four iPhone 16 models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iPhone-SE-4-Evan-Blass.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1419\" height=\"1006\" />\r<br />\nThere have been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/iphone-se-dynamic-island-rumor/\">conflicting rumors</a> about whether the next iPhone SE will have a Dynamic Island or a notch, so we will ultimately have to wait and see.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo further details were revealed about the next iPhone SE in this leak.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new iPhone SE is said to have a similar design as the base iPhone 14 or iPhone 16. Rumored features for the device include a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, a USB-C port, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, a newer A-series chip and an increased 8GB of RAM for Apple Intelligence support, and the first Apple-designed 5G modem.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone SE 4 will be released <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/when-to-expect-new-iphone-se/\">around the quarter mark of 2025</a>. That means the device will likely be released this March or April, just like all three previous iPhone SE models were.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current iPhone SE looks similar to the iPhone 8, with outdated features such as a Touch ID button, Lightning port, and thick bezels around the display. Pricing starts at $429, but at least a slight price increase seems probable for the next model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe leak from Blass also mentioned <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/20/new-ipad-air-models-with-m3-chip-leak/\">new iPad Air and entry-level iPad 11 models</a>, which do not appear to have any obvious design changes. Those devices are also likely to be announced by March or April this year.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/evan-blass/\">Evan Blass</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/20/iphone-se-4th-gen-leak/\">iPhone SE 4 Leak Shows Dynamic Island, Casts Doubt on Rumored 'iPhone 16E' Name</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-leak-shows-dynamic-island-casts-doubt-on-rumored-iphone-16e-name.2447774/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3a78d1a2ef0cd35df4fd249a028413afbc63fa820895001659c5cb583880090b","category":"Apple"}
