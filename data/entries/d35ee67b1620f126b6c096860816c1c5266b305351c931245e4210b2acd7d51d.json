At their worst, they can feel like a cash-in.</p>\n<p>So it was with some trepidation that I recently fired up the \"remastered\" <em>Horizon: Zero Dawn</em>, a game which won me over years ago with its PS4 version due to the simple fact that it was ONE OF THE BEST VIDEO GAMES OF ALL TIME and featured ONE OF THE BEST PROTAGONISTS OF ALL TIME in one of the BEST STORIES OF ALL TIME. (Yes, I like superlatives, which are some of the BEST WORDS OF ALL TIME. But the game world really was terrific.) Even my kids were won over, playing through the game and its sequel multiple times.</p>\n<p>The game tells the story of a future Earth long after catastrophe—in the form of an autonomous robotic swarm—has ruined the planet. But it's not mere dystopia, though one does come across many wrecked and overgrown spaces from that earlier age. <em>Horizon</em> instead focuses on how humans, having lost most of their past knowledge, rebuilt a world in tribal fashion, a world populated by animal-inspired machines. The game's story operates ambitiously in two timelines and features massive killer robots, cults, and mad Sun Kings, all set against the gorgeous background of the American West.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/horizon-zero-dawn-gets-the-graphical-remaster-a-modern-classic-deserves/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/horizon-zero-dawn-gets-the-graphical-remaster-a-modern-classic-deserves/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nate Anderson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d35ee67b1620f126b6c096860816c1c5266b305351c931245e4210b2acd7d51d","category":"Tech"}
