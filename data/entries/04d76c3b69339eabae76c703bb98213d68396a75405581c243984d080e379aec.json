Some are really important, patching numerous critical security vulnerabilities. And some, like the just-released iOS 17.1.1, are very minor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This update simply fixes two limited bugs that only affect a small subset of users. Notably, those with certain BMW models whose wireless charging would mess up NFC/Apple Pay and the few who found the Weather widget not displaying now correctly. The release notes read:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This update provides bug fixes for your iPhone including:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>– In rare circumstances, Apple Pay and other NFC features may become unavailable on iPhone 15 models after wireless charging in certain cars<br />– Weather Lock Screen widget may not correctly display snow</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re an Apple Watch user, the associated watchOS 10.1.1 update is probably a bigger concern, as it fixes an issue that causes the battery to drain faster than it should.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222&amp;xcust=1-1-2129999-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">security releases page</a> says there are no published CVE entries for this round of software releases. It’s always possible that Apple has closed some secret, as-yet-undisclosed security flaws, but as far as they’re telling us, this release does not contain any such updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to install iOS 17.1.1</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To install iOS 17.1.1, simply follow these steps. Note that it can take an hour or two before the update shows up on every iPhone globally, so be patient if you don’t see it right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open Settings</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap <em>General</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap <em>Software Update</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you see more than one software update option available, choose the one that you want to install.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap <em>Download and Install</em>, or <em>Install Now</em> if your iPhone has already downloaded the update.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\niOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"04d76c3b69339eabae76c703bb98213d68396a75405581c243984d080e379aec","category":"Apple"}
