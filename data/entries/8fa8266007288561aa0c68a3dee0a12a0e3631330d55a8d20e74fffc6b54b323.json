The device has sufficient memory to run on-device Apple Intelligence features such as notification summaries, writing tools, and an updated version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>. Apple's user interface design team apparently needs to ensure that Apple Intelligence looks appropriate in a mixed-reality environment. The company also needs to guarantee that it has sufficient cloud-computing capacity to support more devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman does not expect the ‌HomePod‌ to offer Apple Intelligence, instead focusing on \"an entirely new robotic device with a display that includes Apple Intelligence at its core.\" Apple Intelligence requires a minimum of eight gigabytes of memory, but the ‌HomePod‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a> only feature a single gigabyte of memory. The current ‌HomePod‌ is said to be \"too low-volume a product to waste the engineering time\" bringing Apple Intelligence to the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoing forward, Gurman believes that Apple Intelligence will become increasingly critical to Apple devices and form a pillar of its business. Apple Intelligence should get updated more frequently than services like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a>, at least as often as the company's hardware and software offerings. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini\">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/gurman-apple-intelligence-coming-to-vision-pro/\">Gurman: Apple Intelligence Coming to Vision Pro, but Not HomePod</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-apple-intelligence-coming-to-vision-pro-but-not-homepod.2430404/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8fa8266007288561aa0c68a3dee0a12a0e3631330d55a8d20e74fffc6b54b323","category":"Apple"}
