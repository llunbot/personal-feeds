From Proton's press release, here are the highlights:\r<br />\n<blockquote><ul>\r<br />\n    <li><strong>Rich Text Editing</strong>: Create and edit documents with advanced formatting options, allowing for professional and polished outputs.</li>\r<br />\n    <li><strong>File Compatibility</strong>: Easily open and edit documents in multiple formats, including Microsoft .docx, ensuring seamless integration and continuous privacy protection.</li>\r<br />\n    <li><strong>Comments and Collaboration</strong>: Add comments, reply to comments, and resolve them efficiently, fostering a collaborative environment.</li>\r<br />\n    <li><strong>Embed Images</strong>: Enhance your documents by embedding images, providing visual context without compromising on speed.</li>\r<br />\n    <li><strong>Collaborative Cursors and Presence</strong>: See who else is viewing the document in real-time with collaborative cursors, making teamwork more intuitive.</li>\r<br />\n    <li><strong>Invite Collaborators</strong>: Easily invite anyone to collaborate on your documents. Participants without a Proton account will be prompted to create a free one, ensuring a secure environment for all.</li>\r<br />\n</ul></blockquote><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/proton-docs-blog-2-collaboration@2x.jpg\" width=\"2401\" height=\"1200\" />\r<br />\nDrawing on its privacy-is-everything stance, the company says that every document, keystroke, and even cursor movement is end-to-end encrypted in real time. \"Unlike Google Docs, Proton's commitment to never harvesting user data for any purpose, means information remains strictly private,\" promises the company.   \r<br />\n\r<br />\nProton Docs is currently a web application, but Proton says it will eventually be offered as a dedicated app across platforms. Alongside Docs, Proton Drive includes a calendar, file storage, a password manager, and more. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nDocs requires a <a href=\"https://proton.me/pricing\">free Proton Drive account</a>. Proton says it is rolling out Docs starting today, and the feature will be available to all users over the next couple of days.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/proton/\">Proton</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/03/proton-launches-encrypted-google-docs/\">Proton Launches End-to-End Encrypted Alternative to Google Docs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/proton-launches-end-to-end-encrypted-alternative-to-google-docs.2430597/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8a83e2123fdb1899de9c019fd75468cbf1322363b688d4b41bdb3a612fa68181","category":"Apple"}
