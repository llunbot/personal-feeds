Zuckerberg, 33, was called to testify after it was reported that millions of Facebook users had their personal information harvested by Cambridge Analytica.

An early draft of the order <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/04/19/federal-investigation-facebook-could-hold-mark-zuckerberg-accountable-privacy-sources-say/\">obtained</a> by The Washington Post through the Freedom of Information Act shows that the commission was considering holding Zuckerberg responsible.</p>\n<p>The FTC levied the fine in July 2019 in the wake of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/03/facebooks-cambridge-analytica-scandal-explained/\">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a>, which saw political operatives harvesting the personal data of 50 million Facebook users without their consent. (The lawsuit says only 0.31 percent of the affected users consented.) The fine (which was a record for privacy-related penalties) was 50 times larger than the maximum prescribed by a previous FTC consent decree, the lawsuit alleges. It was also well in excess of the previous record fine of $168 million.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1797908#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1797908&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"752a9dcf0e9a942b00dae54b854d7e32a7cc8ec927020cec6dd893eca1c9fac3","category":"Tech"}
