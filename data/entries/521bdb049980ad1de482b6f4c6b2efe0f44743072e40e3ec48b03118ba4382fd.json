It's an \"unprecedented\" effort from six young Portuguese people—ages 11 to 24—who allege that 32 European governments have failed to honor the Paris Agreement to mitigate climate change impacts, causing significant harms and violating their human rights.</p>\n<p>Filed in 2020 after a devastating 2017 Portuguese wildfire that killed 120, the <a href=\"https://youth4climatejustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Application-form-annex.pdf\">complaint</a> alleged that inadequate state measures to reverse climate change have resulted in more frequent heatwaves and wildfires, increasing the risks of heat-related morbidity and fatal illnesses. The plaintiffs also argued that their rights to life, privacy, and family life are being violated, as well as their rights to a life free of discrimination. And because states are unlikely to act fast enough, they've alleged that any current risks are \"set to increase significantly over the course of their lifetimes and will also affect any children they may have.\"</p>\n<p>A victory in the ECHR could lead to a ruling forcing European governments to act faster to meet ambitious climate goals—likely by phasing out fossil fuels, reducing emissions, restricting companies from contributing to emissions released overseas, and limiting imports of goods produced by releasing emissions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971711#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971711&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"521bdb049980ad1de482b6f4c6b2efe0f44743072e40e3ec48b03118ba4382fd","category":"Tech"}
