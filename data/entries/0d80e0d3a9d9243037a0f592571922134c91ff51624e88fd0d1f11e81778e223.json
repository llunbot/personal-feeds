It includes enterprise-grade features such as performance replication, multi-region support, high availability, and sophisticated policies — while HashiCorp SREs handle upgrades, patching, scaling, monitoring, and resilience.</p>\n\n<p>In short: you get the power of Vault Enterprise without managing the infrastructure.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Why performance replication matters</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Performance replication is designed for modern distributed architectures where workloads run across multiple regions. It solves challenges such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High latency</strong> when workloads must reach a distant Vault cluster</li>\n<li><strong>Throughput limitations</strong> during encryption/decryption bursts</li>\n<li><strong>Data-locality requirements</strong> driven by regional compliance or network design</li>\n<li><strong>Read-heavy workloads</strong> that benefit from distributed replicas</li>\n<li><strong>Operational complexity</strong> of managing multi-region Vault deployments manually</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Performance replication enables regional read scalability and high performance while keeping a single, authoritative primary region for writes.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Performance replication in HCP Vault Dedicated</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Performance replication in HCP Vault Dedicated provides:</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Region-local read access</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Secondary clusters serve local reads, token operations, and cryptographic functions close to the application, reducing latency and boosting performance.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Asynchronous state replication</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Secrets, policies, and mounts are synchronized to secondary clusters while local leases and tokens remain region-specific.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Support for multiple secondaries</strong></h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp\">HCP</a> supports multiple performance secondaries for the same primary, allowing truly global distribution without complex self-managed infrastructure.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Transparent write routing</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Write operations automatically go to the primary region, simplifying client logic.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Simplified configuration</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Performance replication is enabled directly from the HCP interface or API. No manual replication pipelines, no specialized networking setup.</p>\n\n<h2>The managed service advantage</h2>\n\n<p>HCP Vault Dedicated delivers enterprise-grade features as a managed service, which brings enormous value.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>1. No multi-region Vault infrastructure to build or maintain</strong></h3>\n\n<p><em>Without HCP</em>, performance replication requires:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Deploying multiple Vault clusters and self-managing complex automation</li>\n<li>Managing TLS, storage backends, and integrated storage</li>\n<li>Setting up network routing and firewall rules</li>\n<li>Configuring replication roles and tokens</li>\n<li>Monitoring synchronization lag</li>\n<li>Upgrading clusters without breaking replication</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>HCP <em>offloads</em> all of this.</strong></p>\n\n<p>When using an HCP service, HashiCorp engineers deploy, operate, and monitor the multi-region topology for you. You simply enable the secondary region(s) and use them.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2. Seamless scaling without added headcount</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Expanding to new markets? Adding another cloud region? Instead of adding SRE/DevOps staff, you:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Click “Add secondary region”</li>\n<li>Point workloads to the new endpoint</li>\n<li>Let HashiCorp handle operations behind the scenes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>3. Automated upgrades and health management</strong></h3>\n\n<p>HashiCorp performs coordinated upgrades on primary and secondary clusters, preserving replication integrity and availability. Your teams don’t spend cycles validating version compatibility or execution steps.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>4. Reduced risk from misconfiguration or downtime</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Because HashiCorp manages the control plane, the risk of replication breakage, node drift, or storage inconsistencies is dramatically lower than in self-managed environments.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>5. Lower total cost of ownership (TCO)</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Instead of maintaining multiple regional clusters, infrastructure, monitoring systems, and on-call staffing, organizations pay for a managed service that already includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Monitoring</li>\n<li>Replication management</li>\n<li>Patching and upgrades</li>\n<li>Multi-region orchestration</li>\n<li>Security hardening</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This shifts cost from infrastructure + headcount → to predictable service tiers.</p>\n\n<h2>Performance replication architecture checklist</h2>\n\n<p>Multi-region planning in HCP Vault Dedicated is a lot easier than self-managed Vault. This performance replication architecture checklist will help your team get started (and it’s about one-tenth as long as the checklist would be for Vault Enterprise):</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Tier selection</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use the Essentials or Standard tier — both include performance replication</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Multi-region design</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Identify primary and secondary regions based on workload locations</li>\n<li>Ensure applications can reach the nearest regional cluster endpoint</li>\n<li>Validate networking connectivity (HVN peering, TGW, PrivateLink, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Configuration and replication setup</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Enable performance replication on the primary cluster</li>\n<li>Link secondary clusters through the HCP interface or API</li>\n<li>Configure optional path filters to limit or tailor replicated content</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Operational practices</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor replication health (HCP provides built-in insights)</li>\n<li>Validate read throughput improvements in all regions</li>\n<li>Test failover scenarios if using performance replication alongside DR replication</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Governance and cost optimization</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use path filters to meet compliance residency requirements</li>\n<li>Review which namespaces/secrets engines need replication</li>\n<li>Ensure operational practices align with compliance controls</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><strong>The outcomes of SaaS for secrets management performance</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Performance replication in HCP Vault Dedicated delivers globally distributed secrets management that is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fast</strong> — region-local reads and crypto operations</li>\n<li><strong>Scalable</strong> — multiple secondaries for global workloads</li>\n<li><strong>Consistent</strong> — one primary source of truth</li>\n<li><strong>Low-latency</strong> — no cross-region round-trips for read workloads</li>\n<li><strong>Managed</strong> — no multi-region infrastructure to build or maintain</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Most importantly, HCP Vault Dedicated enables organizations to operate global-scale Vault deployments with fewer resources, less risk, and lower operational complexity.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re interested in testing HCP Vault Dedicated yourself, visit our HCP portal and <a href=\"https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-up?utm_source=hashicorp&amp;utm_medium=internal-blog&amp;utm_campaign=26Q1_WW_MULTI_RISK_hcp-vault-perf-replication-blog_SIGNUP&amp;utm_content=end-blog-cta&amp;utm_offer=signup.\">sign up</a> for the service, which can take advantage of the <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing?utm_source=hashicorp&amp;utm_medium=internal-blog&amp;utm_campaign=26Q1_WW_MULTI_RISK_hcp-vault-perf-replication-blog_WEBPAGE&amp;utm_content=end-blog-cta&amp;utm_offer=webpage.\">$500 HCP trial credit</a>.</p>\n","author":"Rich DuBose","siteTitle":"HashiCorp Blog","siteHash":"219aa6310b3388f2335eba49871f4df9581f2c58eaeb5e498363b54e835b7001","entryHash":"0d80e0d3a9d9243037a0f592571922134c91ff51624e88fd0d1f11e81778e223","category":"Tech"}
