News started to spread this\nmorning on the MacAdmins Slack, <a href=\"https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2024/04/22/losing-a-giant/\">Rich Trouton’s Der Flounder\nblog</a>, and <a href=\"https://tombridge.com/2024/04/22/thank-you-for-everything-charles/\">Tom Bridge’s site</a> about how our friend and\nTake Control author <a href=\"https://krypted.com/about-2/\">Charles Edge</a> died suddenly and\nunexpectedly on 19 April 2024. He was in his late 40s, and yes,\nhis standard bio picture below gives you a feel for his sense of\nhumor and irreverence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://tombridge.com/2024/04/22/thank-you-for-everything-charles/\">Tom Bridge</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I don’t know what we’ll do without him.</p>\n\n<p>But I can tell you how I’ll remember him, always. Charles always\nhad a kind word for people. He always would take your call. He was\nthe kind of friend who’d drop everything to help you, or to see if\nhe could connect you to someone that could if he couldn’t.</p>\n\n<p>I will miss his levity, his wisdom, his inescapable drive for\nknowledge, his passion for his friends and family, and his\nhumbleness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://podcast.macadmins.org/2024/04/22/in-memoriam-charles-edge/\">The MacAdmins Podcast has a nice In Memorium page</a>, collecting a slew of other remembrances. Nothing but good thoughts to all of his friends and family.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/23/charles-edge-dies\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"12347775e301c361fcaa471ae570b4186c6042f9a48bf7410a5507a1c3c9af0e","category":"Tech"}
