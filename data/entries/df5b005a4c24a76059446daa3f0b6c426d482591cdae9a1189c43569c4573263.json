Pun intended, the Forefront was first launched in 2014, though we first got a look at the Koroyd ‘straws’ at <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/one-ride-review-smith-optics-forefront-straw-hard-hat/\" target=\"_blank\">Interbike in 2013</a>. The Forefront became a staple of the MTB scene, and it wasn’t until 2018 that the Forefront 2 was introduced with improved ventilation and other tweaks. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/forefront3-helmet-3col3.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"433\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/forefront3-helmet-3col3.webp\" alt=\"Smith Forefront 3\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/forefront3-helmet-3col3.webp 433w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/forefront3-helmet-3col3-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/forefront3-helmet-3col3-80x120.webp 80w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/forefront3-helmet-3col2.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"433\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/forefront3-helmet-3col2.webp\" alt=\"Smith Forefront 3\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/forefront3-helmet-3col2.webp 433w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/forefront3-helmet-3col2-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/forefront3-helmet-3col2-80x120.webp 80w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the third-generation Forefront is here with a redesigned shell and a new retention system. The helmet still features complete Koroyd coverage as well as a new internal injected roll cage to help distribute impact forces. That’s in addition to the updated Mips Safety System to cover all the protection bases. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/forefront3-helmet_matteSmithXWildRye_TOP.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/forefront3-helmet_matteSmithXWildRye_TOP.webp\" alt=\"Smith Forefront 3 Wild Rye\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/forefront3-helmet_matteSmithXWildRye_TOP.webp 700w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/forefront3-helmet_matteSmithXWildRye_TOP-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/forefront3-helmet_matteSmithXWildRye_TOP-120x120.webp 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/forefront3-helmet_matteSmithXWildRye_BACK.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/forefront3-helmet_matteSmithXWildRye_BACK.webp\" alt=\"Smith Forefront 3 Wild Rye\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/forefront3-helmet_matteSmithXWildRye_BACK.webp 700w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/forefront3-helmet_matteSmithXWildRye_BACK-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/forefront3-helmet_matteSmithXWildRye_BACK-120x120.webp 120w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The helmet now has 20 vents which claims to increase airflow by 25% over the previous model. Add in their AirEvac channeling, and it should prevent fogging of glasses and goggles. Channels on the front and the rear of the helmet can be used for storage of glasses, and a three-position visor pivots up enough to stash goggles under the visor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helmet retention is now provided through the Smith Flexible Fit System with uses a BOA dial to provide micro-adjustments. It doesn’t appear to be included with the helmet, but Smith calls out that the Forefront 3 is cameral and light mount compatible. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Product Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Complete KOROYD

or those who just want to protect their face at all costs, Smith has a new full-face DH helmet called the Hardline. The appropriately named helmet has already won a Eurobike 2024 Accessories award due to the exceptionally light weight of the full carbon fiber version at 910g (M). The Hardline is also offered in a composite version which is only slightly heavier at 990g (M).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed with input from Smith athlete, Hannah Bergemann, the Hardline incorporates Koroyd ventilated coverage with a Mips Safety System and a patent-pending collarbone impact protection zone on the bottom of the helmet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s been a pleasure to be a part of the Smith DH helmet project. I’ve been wearing the Hardline for a better part of six months and am honored to be trusted to put it to the test,” said Bergemann. “Immediately, I felt at home in the new lid and with the highest safety ratings, I trust it to take on anything I want to ride – from casual bike park laps to Hardline DH tracks and Fest Series jumps. It feels really secure, solid, and comfy when riding. Additionally, I simply wanted it to look cool and I think Smith knocked it out of the park!” she continued. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hardline-carbon-helmet_matteBlackCarbon_INSIDE.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hardline-carbon-helmet_matteBlackCarbon_INSIDE.webp\" alt=\"Smith Hardline pads\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hardline-carbon-helmet_matteBlackCarbon_INSIDE.webp 700w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hardline-carbon-helmet_matteBlackCarbon_INSIDE-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hardline-carbon-helmet_matteBlackCarbon_INSIDE-120x120.webp 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hardline-carbon-helmet_matteBlackCarbon_BACK.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hardline-carbon-helmet_matteBlackCarbon_BACK.webp\" alt=\"Smith Hardline back\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hardline-carbon-helmet_matteBlackCarbon_BACK.webp 700w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hardline-carbon-helmet_matteBlackCarbon_BACK-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hardline-carbon-helmet_matteBlackCarbon_BACK-120x120.webp 120w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside, quick-release cheek pads allow for safe removal by emergency responders in case of an emergency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional features include an adjustable breakaway visor that can be locked into place for under-visor POV camera mounting, D-ring chinstrap fastener for a snug fit, and integration with Smith performance goggles.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smith_Hardline-Carbon_Mips_Helmet_Matte_Black_3Q-Large.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smith_Hardline-Carbon_Mips_Helmet_Matte_Black_3Q-Large.webp\" alt=\"Smith Hardline black\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smith_Hardline-Carbon_Mips_Helmet_Matte_Black_3Q-Large.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smith_Hardline-Carbon_Mips_Helmet_Matte_Black_3Q-Large-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smith_Hardline-Carbon_Mips_Helmet_Matte_Black_3Q-Large-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smith_Hardline-Carbon_Mips_Helmet_Matte_Black_3Q-Large-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smith_Hardline_Mips_Helmet_Matte_Chalk_3Q-Large.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smith_Hardline_Mips_Helmet_Matte_Chalk_3Q-Large.webp\" alt=\"Smith Hardline chalk\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smith_Hardline_Mips_Helmet_Matte_Chalk_3Q-Large.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smith_Hardline_Mips_Helmet_Matte_Chalk_3Q-Large-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smith_Hardline_Mips_Helmet_Matte_Chalk_3Q-Large-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smith_Hardline_Mips_Helmet_Matte_Chalk_3Q-Large-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smith_Hardline_Mips_Helmet_Matte_Pine_Rust_Sagebrush_3Q-Large.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smith_Hardline_Mips_Helmet_Matte_Pine_Rust_Sagebrush_3Q-Large.webp\" alt=\"Smith Hardline sagebrush\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smith_Hardline_Mips_Helmet_Matte_Pine_Rust_Sagebrush_3Q-Large.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smith_Hardline_Mips_Helmet_Matte_Pine_Rust_Sagebrush_3Q-Large-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smith_Hardline_Mips_Helmet_Matte_Pine_Rust_Sagebrush_3Q-Large-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smith_Hardline_Mips_Helmet_Matte_Pine_Rust_Sagebrush_3Q-Large-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Carbon version is only available in black for $795, the Hardline Composite is available in three colors for a more reasonable $390.
