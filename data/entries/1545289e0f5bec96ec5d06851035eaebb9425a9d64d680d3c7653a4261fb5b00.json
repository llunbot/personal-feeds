Perhaps this is to distinguish the Stax from bikes that are geared towards older riders with aggressively dropped top tubes for easy on &amp; off. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Stax_front_new_1300x.png.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"535\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Stax_front_new_1300x.png-800x535.webp\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Stax_front_new_1300x.png-800x535.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Stax_front_new_1300x.png-297x199.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Stax_front_new_1300x.png-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Stax_front_new_1300x.png-768x514.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Stax_front_new_1300x.png.webp 1300w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From that strategic morass, the ENVO Stax arrives, a unit that comes with a 500W hub motor. ENVO points out that’s “twice the output” of an Olympic rider. Admittedly, it would be <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wtb-devo-saddle-handle/\" target=\"_blank\">hard to do much with</a> the Stax unless it did roll under its own power. The “lightweight” eBike weighs 42 lbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, you’ve got a 36V/12.8AH battery, 8-speed Shimano Altus gearing, 700c x 40mm Kenda tires, and Shimano disc brakes. Like many e-bike startups we’ve seen, the Stax only comes in one frame size which will work for many riders, but not all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stax also looks to compete on price — it costs “only” $1,879 MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Stax_rear_new_1300x.png.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"535\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Stax_rear_new_1300x.png-800x535.webp\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Stax_rear_new_1300x.png-800x535.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Stax_rear_new_1300x.png-297x199.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Stax_rear_new_1300x.png-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Stax_rear_new_1300x.png-768x514.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Stax_rear_new_1300x.png.webp 1300w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If that sounds like a lot to pay for a bike that’s purportedly just trying to be a bike — but is, for some reason, instead an eBike — I’m right there with you. Heaven knows most of us millennials don’t have big piles of cash laying around, waiting to be spent. To be fair, the bike does have integrated lighting and a display that can be connected to your smartphone (another Millenial/Gen Z staple).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The most important thing for us when designing this ebike was to make sure that it rides and feels like a traditional bike so the user doesn’t have to compromise on ride feel for the added benefits of an ebike,” ENVO CEO Ali Kazemkhani reiterated. It’s “aimed at millennials and Gen Z riders who want a good-looking, sleek, electric bike that is premium yet affordable.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Delivery starts mid-May 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://envodrive.com/en-us/products/envo-stax-electric-road-bike\" target=\"_blank\">envodrive.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/envo-stax-ebike-for-millennials-gen-z/\">ENVO Stax is THE eBike for Millennials and Gen Z?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Sam Anderson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1545289e0f5bec96ec5d06851035eaebb9425a9d64d680d3c7653a4261fb5b00","category":"Cycling"}
