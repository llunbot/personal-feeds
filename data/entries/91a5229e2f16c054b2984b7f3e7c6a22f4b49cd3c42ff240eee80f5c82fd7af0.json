The report tracks worldwide sales of individual smartphone models, and while hundreds of new phones are released yearly, Counterpoint says this top-10 list represents a whopping 20 percent of the worldwide market.</p>\n<p>The top three spots are all the iPhone 14 models, with the cheaper base model taking the top spot. 2023 saw the release of the iPhone 15, but only in September 2023. The iPhone 15 models rocketed to spots 5, 6, and 7 with only about three months of sales. Sandwiched in between the 14 and 15 models at No. 4 is the iPhone 13, the cheapest modern-looking iPhone Apple sells.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Share-of-Global-Top-10-Best-selling-Smartphones-2023.png\"><img alt=\"Counterpoint's 2023 smartphone chart.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Share-of-Global-Top-10-Best-selling-Smartphones-2023-980x655.png\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Share-of-Global-Top-10-Best-selling-Smartphones-2023.png\">Counterpoint's 2023 smartphone chart.</a> (credit: Counterpoint)</p></div>\n<p>The actual cheapest iPhone, the iPhone SE, didn't make the list this year. The dated design and (maybe?) small size isn't resonating with consumers, and right now, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/qualcomm-is-the-biggest-winner-of-apples-cancelation-of-2024-iphone-se-4-qualcomm%E7%82%BAapple%E5%8F%96%E6%B6%882024-be804b3462e9\">the rumor mill</a> suggests Apple won't be making another SE.
