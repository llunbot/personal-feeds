Multiple sources informed <em>MacRumors</em> that Apple's PR team is planning a product briefing with reporters this Tuesday, March 7, which could be related to the launch of a new iPhone color, but we have not confirmed the topic.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple often introduces new iPhone colors in the spring to boost sales midway through the product cycle. On Tuesday, March 8 of 2022, Apple introduced a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/08/apple-unveils-new-iphone-13-green-and-iphone-13-pro-alpine-green-colors/\">new Green color for the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini</a>, and a new Alpine Green color for the iPhone 13 Pro models. In April 2021, Apple made the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/apple-launching-iphone-12-in-new-purple-color-on-april-30/\">available in Purple</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new iPhone 14 color option would likely be announced with a press release on the Apple Newsroom website on Tuesday morning, potentially alongside the introduction of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/05/iphone-14-cases-new-colors-soon-rumor/\">new iPhone case and Apple Watch band colors</a> for the spring.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Nearly a year to the day after the announcement of the green iPhone 13, a new iPhone 14 color is indeed imminent.</p>â€” Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1632862781509709824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 6, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nApple first launched the iPhone 14 series last September. The new color would be purely a cosmetic change, with the hardware otherwise remaining the same. The new iPhone 15 lineup is expected to be announced in around six months from now.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-14\">iPhone 14 (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/new-iphone-14-color-imminent/\">Apple's Announcement of New iPhone 14 Color Option is 'Imminent'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-announcement-of-new-iphone-14-color-option-is-imminent.2382967/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d078d1356a30d650d5995fe9a0f845a3eb71762a2fb66024bca648cc4eec517f","category":"Apple"}
