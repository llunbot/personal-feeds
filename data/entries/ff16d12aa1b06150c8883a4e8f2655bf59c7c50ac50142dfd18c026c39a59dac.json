He was impressed by Trek’s ability to maintain the previous Madone’s aero credentials while significantly dropping its weight, and praised the new bike’s mix of rear-end comfort and front-end stiffness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike you’ll be testing at the Cyclist Track Day in London will be the Trek Madone SLR 7 Gen 8, courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.balfesbikes.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Balfe’s Bikes</a>, which is built with a Shimano Ultegra Di2 groupset and Bontrager Aeolus Pro 51 aero wheels. Its claimed weight is 7.31kg for size ML and it’s on sale from Balfe’s Bikes for £8,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can read Pete’s full review <a
