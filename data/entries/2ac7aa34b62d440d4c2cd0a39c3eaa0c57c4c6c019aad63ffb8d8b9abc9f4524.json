They see the asphalt conditions, the turns, where they could shave a thousandth of a second, and they often do it by bicycle.</span></p>\n<p><span>At least, not anymore, thanks to a ban by Formula One Management (FOM).</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1421961839.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"F1 Grand Prix of Italy - Previews\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /><span>Riding a bike brings a smile to Sergio Perez, a driver for Oracle Redbull Racing (Image: Mark Thompson/Getty Images)</span></p>\n<p><span>The ban states: </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span>“To clarify and to avoid future misunderstanding, the use of any means of transport (bicycles, e-bikes, scooters, e-scooters, etc) is forbidden during the time window stated as ‘Team Track Walks’ on the Event Timetable.
