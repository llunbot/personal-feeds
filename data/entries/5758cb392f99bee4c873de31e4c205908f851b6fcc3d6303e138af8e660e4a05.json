Based on this timeline, he says Vision Pro will most likely arrive in Apple Stores in late January or early February. This echoes a recent report from Mark Gurman, who also reported that Apple is eyeing a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2178336/apple-accelerates-vision-pro-production-february-launch.html\">Vision Pro launch early in 2024</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will likely hold an event before Vision Pro begins shipping to give the device its own spotlight. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-reality-headset-ar-vr-design-features-specs-price.html\">Vision Pro was unveiled</a> at WWDC in June alongside numerous other products, including the M2 Ultra Mac Pro, 15-inch MacBook Air, and updates to iOS, macOS, and watchOS. A standalone event will give Apple a chance to show off Vision Pro to a captive audience and discuss any changes that have been made to the hardware since June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An event this month to properly introduce Vision Pro would also be Apple’s first January event since the iPad’s unveiling in 2010. Apple previously used the Macworld expo in January to launch several major products, including the MacBook Air, Mac OS X, PowerBook G3, and iPhone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vision Pro will launch Apple’s new spatial computing platform with a $3,499 headset that has an M2 processor, 12 cameras, five sensors, and six microphones. Vision Pro has a pair of ultra-high-resolution 4K displays that generate images that ‘feel’ up to 100 feet wide. It will include support for a variety of apps and services, including Apple TV+ and Disney+, as well as <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2117707/ios-17-2-released-new-features-security-uodates-journal-app.html\">spatial videos</a> captured on the iPhone 15 Pro.</p>\n\nVirtual Reality</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5758cb392f99bee4c873de31e4c205908f851b6fcc3d6303e138af8e660e4a05","category":"Apple"}
