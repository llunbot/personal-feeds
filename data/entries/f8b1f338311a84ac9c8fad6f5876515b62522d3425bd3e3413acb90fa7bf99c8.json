As usual, the refurbished models are discounted by approximately 15% compared to brand new models, with pricing starting at $279 for the 32GB model versus $329 new.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/ipad-8-2020-179-1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple says its certified refurbished iPad models are thoroughly inspected, tested, cleaned, and repackaged in a new white box, with a Lightning cable, power adapter, and manuals included in the box. A refurbished iPad also comes with a new battery and a new outer shell, making it virtually indistinguishable from a brand new iPad.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIntroduced in September 2020, the 8th-generation iPad features a 10.2-inch Retina display and the A12 Bionic chip with a Neural Engine.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRefurbished iPads are covered by Apple's standard one-year warranty. This coverage can be extended with an <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/S6529LL/A/applecare-for-ipad-ipad-air-ipad-mini\">AppleCare+ for iPad plan</a>, available for a one-time fee of $69 or $3.49 per month for 24 months in the United States.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple also started selling <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/09/apple-refurbished-2020-ipad-pro/\">refurbished 2020 iPad Pro models</a> this week. While certified refurbished iPads represent a decent opportunity for savings straight from Apple, better deals are sometimes available from resellers like Amazon and Best Buy.
