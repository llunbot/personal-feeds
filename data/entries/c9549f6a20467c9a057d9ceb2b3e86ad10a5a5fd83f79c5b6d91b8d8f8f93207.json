{"title":"First day out, first discount for the M4 Mac mini at Amazon","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2515267/first-day-out-first-discount-for-the-m4-mac-mini-at-amazon.html","date":1731091830000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Today’s the first day you can freely buy the new Mac mini without a pre-order, and it’s also the first time we’re seeing a real discount on Apple’s tiny PC. Amazon is selling the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLBTPDCS/\">base model with 256GB of storage for $550</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLBX4B1K?th=1\">the model with 512GB for $749</a>, a savings of $50 off either model. Both now come with 16GB of RAM too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We already <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2512911/m4-pro-mac-mini-review-remarkably-small-and-incredibly-powerful.html\">reviewed the new Mac mini</a> and found it’s super tiny and quite, delivers a decent selection of ports, and offers an excellent performance with the speedy M4 chip. We enjoyed the smaller Mac so much that we gave it a 4-star rating. Our only criticism, other then the lack of a single USB-A port, is the price of Apple’s upgrades, which cost an extra $200 for double the storage (256GB to 512GB). At least, with this instant discount at Amazon, you get to save $50 off that price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main thing about the M4 Mac mini is how incredibly small it is. As we wrote, “Apple told us the new Mac mini was smaller. It shows us photos and videos. And still, when I took it out of the box, I was somewhat unprepared for just how small it actually is,” we wrote. So how small is it? Well, it’s just 5×5 inches square and 2 inches tall, only a little larger than the Apple TV and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2514485/how-small-is-the-m4-mac-mini-really-this-small.html\">ready to fit into your palm</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So snatch the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLBTPDCS/\">256GB Mac mini for $550</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLBX4B1K?th=1\">512GB Mac Mini M4 for $749</a> and save $50 on the smallest Mac Apple has ever made.</p>\n\n\n<span>Save $50 on the Mac Mini M4</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLBX4B1K?th=1\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c9549f6a20467c9a057d9ceb2b3e86ad10a5a5fd83f79c5b6d91b8d8f8f93207","category":"Apple"}
