Such days will call for a tyre with puncture protection and a sturdy tyre casing. Tyre pressure will need to be relatively high.</p>\n<p>But in sloppy December mud, traction and not puncturing will be your uttermost concern. You’ll want a tyre you can run as low as possible to stay upright on descents and through bends.</p>\n<p>Here, we talk through how to choose the right cyclocross tyre for every condition and how to ensure that tyre is at the right pressure for you.</p>\n<h2>What is a cyclocross tyre?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Challenge Limus has stood the test of time, and mud.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oli Woodman / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A cyclocross tyre looks like a slightly wider and knobbly road tyre.</p>\n<p>The maximum permitted width in UCI-sanctioned cyclocross races is 33mm. In UK regional races, you can run 35mm or 38mm.</p>\n<p>A CX tyre is a bit of a hybrid, meeting some of the demands of on- and off-road riding.</p>\n<p>The slickest treads resemble something the pros might use in the cobbled classics, while the grippiest are more akin to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\">mountain bike tyres</a>.</p>\n<h2>How to choose the right cyclocross tyres for every condition</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> When the course is as filthy as this, tyre choice is simple.</span></figcaption><span> <i>CorVos/SWpix.com</i></span></div>\n<p>There are a plethora of cyclocross tyre types to suit the range of surfaces you’ll encounter.</p>\n<p>The potential of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cyclocross-bikes/\">best cyclocross bikes</a> will be wasted if they’re shod with the wrong tyres.</p>\n<p>Semi-slick rubber might be fantastic on firm grass in September. But by the middle of winter, unless you’re a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/technique/cyclocross-skills\">cyclocross skills </a>maestro, you’ll spend a lot of time on the deck.</p>\n<p>What is more, the aggressive, knobbly tread of a mud tyre will slow you down in fast conditions.</p>\n<p>Starting out, you can afford to settle for an all-round tyre, but as you become more serious you might consider a dry and wet option too.</p>\n<p>Cyclocross tyres fall into three main categories.</p>\n<h3>Mud tyres</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This is the Terreno Wet, which has widely spaced, angled lugs for shedding mud.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> the quintessential CX tyre, for UK conditions at least, features deep, aggressive knobs, possibly higher on the shoulder</li>\n<li><strong>When to use it:</strong> most of the UK season, except when the grass is still green</li>\n<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Vittoria Terreno Wet, Michelin Power Mud, Challenge Limus</li>\n</ul><h3>File tread</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Chicane is a very popular file tread tyre.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James Huang / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> fine tread runs down the middle and there may be raised knobs on the sides</li>\n<li><strong>When to use it:</strong> hard, fast dirt or on dry grass</li>\n<li><strong>Example:</strong> Challenge Chicane, Specialized Tracer, Vittoria Terreno Dry</li>\n</ul><h3>All-round</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Michelin Power Cyclocross Jet TLR tyre is designed for riding fast in dry off-road conditions.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Michelin</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> small knobs provide grip, but lugs aren’t large enough to add excessive rolling resistance</li>\n<li><strong>When to use it:</strong> in lighter mud and when drier sections of the course require speed</li>\n<li><strong>Example:</strong> Michelin Power Jet, Schwalbe X-One</li>\n</ul><h2>Tubular, tubeless or clincher – what’s the best option for CX racing??</h2>\n<p>The presence of all three types of tyre at cyclocross races reflects their strengths and weaknesses, and individual rider preferences.</p>\n<h3>Tubular</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tubular tyres are labour- and cost-intensive.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>Despite going out of fashion on the road, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tubs-vs-clinchers-which-are-faster/\">tubular tyres</a> are favoured by a surprising number of CX racers. They can be run at a low PSI and, unlike tubeless tyres, cannot burp (though you can still roll a poorly glued tyre right off of a rim).</p>\n<p>With a tubular tyre, an inner tube is sewn into a fabric casing and stuck onto a tubular-specific rim.</p>\n<p>They are lighter and thought to roll faster than clinchers, but their fragility, price and time-consuming maintenance is losing them favour.</p>\n<h3>Tubeless</h3>\n<p>The case for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless tyres</a> on the road remains up for debate. However, the argument for tubeless cyclocross tyres is strong.</p>\n<p>Manufacturers say tubeless tyres present lower rolling resistance. Any punctures during the race should seal up themselves thanks to the sealant.</p>\n<p>The absence of tubes removes the risk of pinch flats, permitting a lower PSI to maintain grip in the slipperiest conditions.</p>\n<h3>Clincher</h3>\n<p>A good overall choice for cyclocross, clinchers contain an inner tube within a tyre.</p>\n<p>They’re cheap and their ease of use makes it simple to switch between tyres to suit the day’s conditions.</p>\n<p>In soft conditions, they can be run at low enough PSI to grip in the mud. However, the risk of a pinch flat increases when going over hard objects, such as tree roots and rocks.</p>\n<h2>How to find the perfect cyclocross tyre pressure</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Taking a track pump to races is the best way to adjust your tyres.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd</i></span></div>\n<p>Dialling in the ideal tyre pressure for the day requires trial and error, both in training and on race day.</p>\n<p>When it’s anything but dry, the most experienced racers will go as low as they can go.</p>\n<p>The key thing you want to avoid is bottoming out the rim, which is when an under-inflated tyre causes the outside of the wheel to hit into the ground, possibly leading to a puncture.</p>\n<p>In training, if you find yourself getting jolted about or struggling for grip in bends, let out some air.</p>\n<p>If you’re running clinchers and suffering pinch flats, you’ll need to pump them up.</p>\n<p>On race day, if you’re running 33mm tyres, in average conditions, inflate to 30-35psi to kick things off. See how this feels on the practice laps and adjust if needed.</p>\n<p>On a really muddy course, clinchers can be run as low as 20psi with little risk of puncturing. <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-tubeless-road-tyres/\">Tubeless tyres</a> can be let down to 15psi in the same conditions.</p>\n<p>A rider’s tyre pressure will vary according to differences in skill, speed, weight and tyre tread pattern.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A tyre pressure gauge removes much of the guesswork.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Katherine Moore / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The best ‘cross racers handle their bikes so deftly the pressure can be lower, while heavier riders need to pump up their tyres more.</p>\n<p>The old-school method of squeezing the tyres to assess their inflation suffices for some.</p>\n<p>But a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-tyre-pressure-gauges/\">digital pressure gauge</a> is more precise, and take a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-pump/\">track pump</a> to your race to make inflating and deflating your tyres easier.</p>","author":"Jack Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"6686080ec1dfdd2ad9c2126d8c3821b54177e5dcf2f55df366d4041e2976a3c0","category":"Cycling"}
