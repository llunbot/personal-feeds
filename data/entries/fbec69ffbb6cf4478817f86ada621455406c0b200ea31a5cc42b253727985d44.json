However, Apple's internal work is said to be focused on smaller-scale AI features that operate on-device and do not require an internet connection.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo drive more powerful cloud-based generative AI features, such as the ability to create images and write essays based on single prompts, Apple is seeking a partner that has the necessary large-scale hardware infrastructure and compute capabilities already in place.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSiri is expected to take advantage of the artificial intelligence improvements that Apple plans to bring in iOS 18. One leaker has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tech_Reve/status/1722418466647625999?s=20\">suggested</a> that Apple is planning to use large-language models to entirely revamp Siri and turn it into the \"ultimate virtual assistant.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman says that one of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/apple-says-ios-18-ambitious-compelling/\">specific features</a> Apple is developing is an improved interaction between Siri and the Messages app, which would let Siri auto-complete sentences more effectively and answer complex questions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBut with the likes of Nvidia and other AI companies continuing to reshape the technology landscape, some investors are reportedly concerned that Apple will fail to keep up with the pace of change, and may not see the \"hypergrowth\" expected of it unless the iPhone maker can boost its credibility by deploying generative AI features this year. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/\">Apple GPT</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/\">OpenAI</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/apple-iphone-ai-talks-google-openai-ongoing/\">Apple's iPhone AI Talks With Google and OpenAI Still Ongoing</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-iphone-ai-talks-with-google-and-openai-still-ongoing.2422438/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fbec69ffbb6cf4478817f86ada621455406c0b200ea31a5cc42b253727985d44","category":"Apple"}
