This time around, we find Aquaman juggling domestic duties while battling an existential threat to Atlantis in the form of an old foe bent on exacting revenge.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for 2018's <em>Aquaman</em> below.)</strong></p>\n<p>When it was first announced, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaman_(film)\"><em>Aquaman</em></a> initially struck me as <a href=\"http://changed%20their%20tune\">an odd choice</a> for a superhero movie. After all, that was the role—deemed ripe for satire—that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entourage_(American_TV_series)\"><em>Entourage</em></a>'s fictional actor Vincent Chase took on, with James Cameron supposedly directing for purposes of the plot. Then early images appeared with Jason Momoa in all his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaman\">Aquaman</a> glory, and many people changed their tune. The finished film wasn't a slam dunk with critics—I enjoyed it well enough but thought the plot was an unholy mess—but you sure couldn't argue with that box office return. <em>Aquaman</em> grossed a whopping $1.15 billion worldwide, the highest-grossing film in the DCEU.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1967115#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1967115&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c34315fb649353b279a23dd7433fbdda80ec606f12adf8155df342abc500fe76","category":"Tech"}
