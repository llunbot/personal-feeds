The <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.566294/gov.uscourts.nysd.566294.279.0.pdf\">ruling to vacate the bankruptcy plan</a> was issued by Judge Colleen McMahon in US District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p>Non-debtors like the Sackler family members aren't obligated to \"disclose their assets and apply them... to the resolution of the claims of their creditors,\" McMahon noted. Because non-debtors do not have those obligations, they also \"do not have any rights at all under the 'special remedial scheme' that is bankruptcyâ€”certainly not the 'right' to have claims that are being asserted against them outside the bankruptcy process released.\"</p>\n<p>The $4.5 billion <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/08/sacklers-say-they-wont-pay-4-5b-settlement-if-judge-rejects-immunity-deal/\">settlement</a> was previously <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/billionaire-sacklers-granted-lifetime-legal-immunity-in-opioid-settlement/\">approved</a> by a judge in US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. While 15 US states agreed to the settlement, eight states and the District of Columbia objected to it and filed appeals. US government officials also objected to the settlement.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1821527#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1821527&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4d36b404238c057763d94a00a52a172ea4e4abed4eb5cd25f4a502a78ff19262","category":"Tech"}
