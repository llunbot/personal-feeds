Many blamed the January 2024 Google Play system update for the issue, and yesterday, Google confirmed that hypothesis. Google posted <a href=\"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/256412156/\">an official solution</a> to the issue on the Pixel Community Forums, but there's no user-friendly solution here. Google's automatic update system broke people's devices, but the fix is completely manual, requiring users to download the developer tools, install drivers, change settings, plug in their phones, and delete certain files via a command-line interface.</p>\n<p>The good news is that, if you've left your phone sitting around in a nearly useless state for the last week or two, following the directions means you won't actually lose any data. Having a week or two of downtime is not acceptable to a lot of people, though, and <a href=\"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/256412156?hl=en&amp;msgid=256419454\">several </a>users <a href=\"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/256412156?hl=en&amp;msgid=256495919\">replied</a> to the thread saying they had already wiped their device to get their phone working again and had to deal with the resulting data loss (despite many attempts and promises, Android does not have a comprehensive backup system that works).</p>\n<p>The bad news is that I don't think many normal users will be able to follow Google's directions. First, you'll need to perform the secret action to enable Android's Developer Options (you tap on the build number seven times). Then, you have to download Google's \"SDK Platform-Tools\" zip file, which is meant for app developers. After that, plug in your phone, switch to the correct \"File transfer\" connection mode, open a terminal, navigate to the platform-tools folder, and run both “./adb uninstall com.google.android.media.swcodec” and “./adb uninstall com.google.android.media.\" Then reboot the phone and hope that works.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000532#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000532&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b264137fffbcaebc17c828137be9f1344dab9c884a0dc1d0a05ffe95ed3c96be","category":"Tech"}
