But that trend has been shifting as various governments and funding agencies are requiring that the science they fund <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/us-government-to-make-all-research-it-funds-open-access-on-publication/\">be published in open-access journals</a>. The transition is happening gradually, though, and a lot of the historical literature remains locked behind paywalls.</p>\n<p>These paywalls can pose a problem for researchers who aren't at well-funded universities, including many in the Global South, which may not be able to access the research they need to understand in order to pursue their own studies. One solution has been Sci-Hub, a site where people can upload PDFs of published papers so they can be shared with anyone who can access the site. Despite <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/06/scientific-research-piracy-site-hit-with-15-million-fine/\">losses in publishing industry lawsuits</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/05/piracy-site-for-academic-journals-playing-game-of-domain-name-whac-a-mole/\">attempts to block access</a>, Sci-Hub continues to serve up research papers that would otherwise be protected by paywalls.</p>\n<p>But what it's serving up may not always be the latest and greatest. Generally, when a paper is retracted for being invalid, publishers issue an updated version of its PDF with clear indications that the research it contains should no longer be considered valid. Unfortunately, it appears that once Sci-Hub has a copy of a paper, it doesn't necessarily have the ability to ensure it's kept up to date. Based on a scan of its content done by researchers from India, about 85 percent of the invalid papers they checked had no indication that the paper had been retracted.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/science-paper-piracy-site-sci-hub-shares-lots-of-retracted-papers/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/science-paper-piracy-site-sci-hub-shares-lots-of-retracted-papers/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b296de39c0326a0a2634b5b6b2965149c63eeb420565ee418d307076fad71b2a","category":"Tech"}
