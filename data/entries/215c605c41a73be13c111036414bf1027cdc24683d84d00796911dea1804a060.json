On Thursday, the American automaker announced the Cyberquad for Kids, an angular electric all-terrain vehicle inspired by the company's 2019 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/11/tesla-wants-to-reinvent-the-pickup-with-the-39900-cybertruck/\">Cybertruck concept</a>. At <a href=\"https://shop.tesla.com/product/cyberquad-for-kids\" target=\"_blank\">$1,900</a>, the ATV costs a tiny fraction of the next-cheapest Tesla you can order online.</p>\n<p>This isn't the first time we've seen an ATV from Tesla. When CEO Elon Musk debuted the polarizing pickup, he also showed off an ATV to go with it, albeit one that <a href=\"https://www.thedrive.com/news/31175/it-looks-like-the-tesla-cyberquad-atv-is-actually-a-yamaha-raptor-underneath\">turned out to be a Yamaha Raptor with a powertrain swap</a>. The Cyberquad for Kids is manufactured for the automaker by Radio Flyer.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests, this ATV is a bit smaller. Although Tesla says it's suitable for anyone ages 8 or older, the Cyberquad for Kids can only accommodate riders of up to 150 lbs (68 kg), so adults might find it too diminutive.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817404#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817404&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
