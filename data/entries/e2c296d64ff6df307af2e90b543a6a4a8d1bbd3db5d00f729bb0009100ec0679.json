{"title":"Why Dolphin Isn’t Coming to the App Store (Spoiler: It Needs a JIT)","link":"https://oatmealdome.me/blog/why-dolphin-isnt-coming-to-the-app-store/","date":1718745341000,"content":"\n<p>“OatmealDome”, developer of an iOS fork of the GameCube and Wii emulator Dolphin:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Two weeks ago, Apple modified their App Store guidelines to allow\nretro game emulators in the App Store. This week, Delta, a\nmulti-system emulator that was previously only available via\nAltStore, was released on the App Store. Since these events\nhappened, we’ve been asked many times if we will submit DolphiniOS\n(our fork of Dolphin) to the App Store.</p>\n\n<p><em>Unfortunately, no.</em></p>\n\n<p>Apple still does not allow us to use a vital technology that is\nnecessary for Dolphin to run with good performance: JIT. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Apple generally does not allow apps to use JIT\nrecompilers on iOS. The only exceptions are Safari and alternative\nweb browsers in Europe. We submitted a DMA interoperability\nrequest to Apple for JIT support, but Apple denied the request a\nfew weeks ago.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Swift Playgrounds is an exception too. Apple trusts itself to use JIT compilation safely, but not third-party developers. That’s not unreasonable — but I’m not sure it’s compliant with the DMA.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/18/dolphin-jit-apple\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e2c296d64ff6df307af2e90b543a6a4a8d1bbd3db5d00f729bb0009100ec0679","category":"Tech"}
