(TSMC) were briefly paused today following a 7.4-magnitude earthquake that hit Taiwan, according to a company statement <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-03/tsmc-evacuates-production-lines-after-major-taiwan-quake\">provided to Bloomberg and others</a>.</p>\n<p>TSMC says that workers were evacuated as part of its earthquake safety protocols and that they have already returned to work. Bloomberg reports that the company is still \"examining impact\" to its operations, but it \"expects to resume production overnight.\"</p>\n\n<p>The quake's epicenter was on Taiwain's east coast and has prompted tsunami warnings in Japan, China, and the Philippines, according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/world/asia/taiwan-earthquake.html\">The New York Times</a>. The quake was followed by a long series of over 200 aftershocks, including one 6.5-magnitude aftershock. It's the strongest earthquake to affect Taiwan since <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Jiji_earthquake\">the 7.7-magnitude Jiji earthquake</a> in 1999. As of this writing, the NYT reports that at least nine people have died, and 1,011 have reported injuries.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014488#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014488&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4f4e613282a10872f0b493cc3e8b471e224dc23daf89287fa3e8a2778f2e4306","category":"Tech"}
