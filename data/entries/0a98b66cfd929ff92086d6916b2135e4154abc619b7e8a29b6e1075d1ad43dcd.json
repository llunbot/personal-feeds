Roval says it is four watts faster than the separate bar and stem of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-tarmac-sl7-review-end-of-the-venge\" target=\"_blank\">S-Works Tarmac SL7</a> bike, which supposedly could equate to – wait for it – 32cm in a sprint finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new cockpit is available in 15 width/length combinations, which Roval has chosen based on its bike-fit database. It’s priced at £475 / $600 / €580 / AU$850.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Four watts faster</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\"

one-piece design, with the removal of the stem faceplate and its bolts helping to streamline the airflow over the bike’s front end, even in a design where they’re slightly recessed.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n

</div>\n\n\n<p>The brand claims this has allowed it to design the Rapide Cockpit’s leading edge as a single aerofoil and optimise the airflow for the speeds that are typically maintained in solo breakaways and sprint finishes. As you’d expect, to keep the airflow smooth there’s full internal cable/hose routing. The Rapide Cockpit can be used with both electronic and mechanical groupsets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roval’s calculations suggest that in a 250m sprint to the line, the four watt saving adds 32cm to how far a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-do-i-improve-my-cycling-sprinting-power\">sprinter </a>can travel. That may not seem like a lot, but the brand reckons it was enough to allow <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/fabio-jakobsen-no-ordinary-comeback\">Fabio Jakobsen</a>, who was using the Rapide Cockpit, to win the sprint on Stage 2 of this year’s Tirreno-Adriatico by a bike throw. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rapide Cockpit has also seen action with the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/sd-worx\">SD Worx</a> women’s team, with Demi Vollering and Lotte Kopecky both using the one-piece design on their run of winning rides this spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lighter and stiffer</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Vollering-Fleche-Wallonne-2023.jpg\" alt /><figcaption>Wednesday April 19 2023\n26th La Flèche Wallonne Féminine (1.WWT) One day race: Huy – Mur de Huy (127.3km)\n\nPhoto: Francesco Rachello / Tornanti.cc</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are more marginal gains in weight and stiffness claimed from the one-piece construction, with Roval saying that the Rapide Cockpit, at 310g for a 100mm × 420mm cockpit, is 50g lighter than the Rapide bar and standard stem that come as standard on the S-Works Tarmac SL7. The stiffness-to-weight ratio is also said to be greater than the brand has achieved with any two-piece design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fit and adjustability are issues with one piece bar/stem designs and ones that are expensive to put right if the bars don’t work for you. Roval says it has solved this by offering 15 different width/length combinations, chosen based on data from Specialized’s Retul bike-fit database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can have bar widths between 380mm and 440mm in combination with stem lengths between 75mm and 125mm, which all have a -6 degree angle to suit the Tarmac SL7. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rapide Cockpit doesn’t come cheap, but if you’re after the winning edge, as the pros are, it might just tip the balance in a dash to the line. It’s still small change compared to the price of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-tarmac-sl7-review-end-of-the-venge\">S-Works Tarmac SL7</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Roval Rapide Cockpit specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Roval-Rapide-Cockpit.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Roval-Rapide-Cockpit.jpeg 2400w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Roval-Rapide-Cockpit.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Roval-Rapide-Cockpit.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Roval-Rapide-Cockpit.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Roval-Rapide-Cockpit.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Roval-Rapide-Cockpit.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Roval-Rapide-Cockpit.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Roval-Rapide-Cockpit.jpeg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Roval</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Weight (100mm x 420mm): </strong>310g</li><li><strong>Width/length combinations available:</strong> 15</li><li><strong>Length options:</strong> 75mm to 125mm</li><li><strong>Width options: </strong>380mm to 440mm</li><li><strong>Drop:</strong> 125mm</li><li><strong>Reach: </strong>75mm</li><li><strong>Stem angle: </strong>-6 degrees</li><li><strong>Price: </strong>£475 / $600 / €580 / AU$850</li></ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/roval-rapide-cockpit\">Roval says new Rapide Cockpit will save you 32cm in a sprint</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"0a98b66cfd929ff92086d6916b2135e4154abc619b7e8a29b6e1075d1ad43dcd","category":"Cycling"}
