Each package contained a return slip and a pair of shoes from an Amazon buyer located in North America who wrongly shipped their rejected shoes to Nitu's address.</p>\n<p>Nitu thinks she knows what's happening. She believes that Amazon sellers stole her information from a dormant Amazon account and are using her name and home address as an easy way to get rid of unwanted return items that sellers either cannot afford to store or do not wish to store. The Better Business Bureau (BBB) told CBC that it sounded like a vendor-return scheme that's common in the US but rarer in Canada, where foreign sellers dodge fees associated with storing and shipping return items by sending the items anywhere but their own addresses.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959917#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959917&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b85e58130a34ee11c905d3872f6bb4182329069bdff685f058ba6ae77bd13f00","category":"Tech"}
