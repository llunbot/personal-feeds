Hoping to find some solutions tonight to get this resolved in the am.</blockquote>One possible solution <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253295779?answerId=256182042022#256182042022\">floated on Apple Support Communities</a> is that users may need to revive or restore their Mac's firmware. \"In very rare circumstances, such as a power failure during a macOS update or upgrade, a Mac may become unresponsive and so the firmware must be revived or restored,\" Apple says in a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/apple-configurator-2/apdebea5be51/mac\">support document</a>.  \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAll user reports suggest the issue is impacting older MacBook Pro, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, and ‌iMac‌ models. More recent computers such as Apple silicon-based Macs are not seemingly having problems, at least according to the lack of user reports suggesting so. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the issue with ‌macOS Monterey‌ bricking Mac computers is not as widespread as last year with ‌macOS Big Sur‌, enough users are reporting that the update is causing problems to warrant some concern. It's possible that following this article, even more users will come forward and share their experience with ‌macOS Monterey‌ causing issues on their Macs. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is currently testing macOS 12.1, but that isn't expected to be released for at least several more weeks. ‌macOS Monterey‌ is still in its first version, and it's typically a safe bet to wait until several updates are released before updating to the latest version from a previous generation. It's possible a smaller dot-update could be released to address bugs and security fixes. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234\">macOS Monterey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/01/macos-monterey-bricking-older-macs/\">Some Older Macs Reportedly Bricked After Installing macOS Monterey</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-older-macs-reportedly-bricked-after-installing-macos-monterey.2321095/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=vKncYC42KXQ:saqdFzIxeTI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=vKncYC42KXQ:saqdFzIxeTI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/vKncYC42KXQ\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"101b05ae36cecd95bca95644d93ab2aa9854cdd503ae324e8018539e2d3c3999","category":"Apple"}
