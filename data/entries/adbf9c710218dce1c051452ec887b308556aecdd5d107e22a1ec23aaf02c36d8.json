The written ruling said, \"it is clear that Dr. Wright engaged in the deliberate production of false documents to support false claims and use the Courts as a vehicle for fraud. Despite acknowledging in this Trial that a few documents were inauthentic (generally blamed on others), he steadfastly refused to acknowledge any of the forged documents. Instead, he lied repeatedly and extensively in his attempts to deflect the allegations of forgery.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025608#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025608&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"adbf9c710218dce1c051452ec887b308556aecdd5d107e22a1ec23aaf02c36d8","category":"Tech"}
