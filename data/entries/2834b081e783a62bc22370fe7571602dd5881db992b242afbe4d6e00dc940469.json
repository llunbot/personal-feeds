Apple scheduled its release calendar similarly last year, when it announced and released new iPhones in September and then <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/scary-fast-apple-will-stream-a-new-product-event-on-october-30/\">launched the first wave of M3 Macs around Halloween</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Bloomberg's Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-15/apple-s-hearing-aid-sleep-apnea-saved-iphone-16-event-m4-mac-launch-details-m13kkabb\">believes</a> that the event will mainly focus on the first wave of Macs with M4 processors, following the standard M4's introduction in the iPad Pro earlier this year. As he has reported previously, he expects new MacBook Pro models with the M4 and \"pro-level M4 chip options,\" presumably the M4 Pro and M4 Max. He also expects an M4 version of the 24-inch iMac.</p>\n<p>But the most interesting of the new Macs will still be the redesigned Mac mini, which hasn't gotten an M3 update at all and has been using the same basic external design since 2010. This Mac mini is said to be closer in size to the Apple TV than the current mini, but still uses an internal power supply so that owners won't have to wrangle a power brick. At least some of the current device's ports will be replaced by USB-C and/or Thunderbolt ports, something that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/16/mac-mini-5-usb-c-ports-leak/\">MacRumors apparently confirmed earlier today</a> when they found a reference to an \"Apple silicon Mac mini (5 ports)\" in an Apple software update (some of those ports are reportedly on the front of the device, a nice Mac Studio design upgrade that I'd like to see on a new Mac mini).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050106#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050106&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2834b081e783a62bc22370fe7571602dd5881db992b242afbe4d6e00dc940469","category":"Tech"}
