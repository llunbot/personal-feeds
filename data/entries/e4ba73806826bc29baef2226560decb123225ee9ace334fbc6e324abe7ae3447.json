{"title":"Microsoft Introduces 365 Copilot, Their AI Chat Integration for Office","link":"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/","date":1678995587000,"content":"\n<p>Jared Spataro, “corporate vice president, modern work &amp; business applications”,<sup>*</sup> on the Microsoft blog:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Copilot is integrated into Microsoft 365 in two ways. It works\nalongside you, embedded in the Microsoft 365 apps you use every\nday — Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams and more — to\nunleash creativity, unlock productivity and uplevel skills. Today\nwe’re also announcing an entirely new experience: Business Chat.\nBusiness Chat works across the LLM, the Microsoft 365 apps, and\nyour data — your calendar, emails, chats, documents, meetings and\ncontacts — to do things you’ve never been able to do before. You\ncan give it natural language prompts like “Tell my team how we\nupdated the product strategy,” and it will generate a status\nupdate based on the morning’s meetings, emails and chat threads.</p>\n\n<p>With Copilot, you’re always in control. You decide what to keep,\nmodify or discard. Now, you can be more creative in Word, more\nanalytical in Excel, more expressive in PowerPoint, more\nproductive in Outlook and more collaborative in Teams.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hard to predict how these AI-powered features are going to play out, but it feels like they’re soon going to be table stakes. An accurate, concise, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/harrymccracken/status/1636387980314279937\">automatically generated summary of a meeting you missed</a> — that feels undeniably useful.</p>\n\n<p><small>* What a mouthful of a job title. Why not just “vice president, business applications”? “Corporate” seems unnecessary, and “modern” even more so. Is there a VP for out-of-date business applications too? Someone who’s still in charge of updating the DOS versions of Word and Excel?</small></p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/16/microsoft-copilot\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e4ba73806826bc29baef2226560decb123225ee9ace334fbc6e324abe7ae3447","category":"Tech"}
