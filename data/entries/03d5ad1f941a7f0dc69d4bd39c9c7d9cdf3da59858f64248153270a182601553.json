Strava says it is the first integration of its kind.</p>\n<p>Whether you like mashing the pedals to King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard or riding into a trance while vibing out to Enya, Strava says the new feature enables riders to “tap into the motivation that gets them moving”.</p>\n<p>It will be of most interest to cyclists who record rides directly on their phone using the Strava app, whether that’s via a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-phone-holder/\">smartphone mounted to the handlebar</a> or during an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/beginners-guide-to-indoor-training-all-you-need-to-get-started/\">indoor training</a> ride.</p>\n<p>The press release does not state whether a paid Strava subscription is required to use the new feature.</p>\n<h2>Top workout songs on Spotify, according to Strava</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You can now listen to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/listen-to-bikeradar-podcast/\">BikeRadar Podcast</a> from the Strava app (other podcasts are available, but ours is the best).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Getty</i></span></div>\n<p>Strava has also revealed the most popular songs for workouts.</p>\n<p>According to Spotify, the following songs were the most popular choices in user-generated playlists including the terms ‘workout’, ‘run’, ‘exercise’, ‘cardio’, ‘cycling’ or ‘gym’.</p>\n<ul><li><em>I’m Good (Blue)</em> by Bebe Rexha and David Guetta</li>\n<li><em>Industry Baby</em> by Lil Nas X, Jack Harlow</li>\n<li><em>Unholy</em> by Sam Smith and Kim Petras</li>\n</ul><p>Truthfully, that list has made everyone at BikeRadar feel quite old and totally out of the loop.</p>\n<p>Strava’s takeover of this week’s ‘Workout’ playlist on Spotify hasn’t helped either.</p>\n\n<p>What do you like to listen to while cycling?
