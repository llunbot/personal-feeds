Though the cable is the same, the ‌Apple Watch SE‌ will charge at standard speeds.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith the fast charge cable, the Series 7 is able to charge 33 percent faster than with a standard Apple Watch charging puck thanks to new charging architecture that is not built into the ‌Apple Watch SE‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌Apple Watch SE‌'s product page confirms the upgrade and lists the device as shipping with a \"1m Magnetic Charger to USB-C Cable\" rather than the standard Magnetic Cable that used USB-A. Apple previously had a non-fast charging version of the USB-C Apple Watch cable, but it has been discontinued and is <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/us/search/Apple-Watch-Magnetic-Charger-to-USB-C-Cable-1-m?rdt=redirectionFromProductPage&amp;tab=accessories\">no longer available</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ and ‌Apple Watch SE‌ will ship with a USB-C Apple Watch charging cable, the Apple Watch Series 3, Apple's lowest cost option, still continues to feature a USB-A charging cable. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE\">Apple Watch SE (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/16/apple-watch-se-usb-c-charging-cable/\">Apple Watch SE Now Comes With a USB-C Charging Cable</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-se-now-comes-with-a-usb-c-charging-cable.2311312/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=-mZxClXPikI:b6uHwkgSJxU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=-mZxClXPikI:b6uHwkgSJxU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/-mZxClXPikI\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c39285ca94db4f611c10f932a40c18420d2d808793baf6f93c10c2d369e91a85","category":"Apple"}
