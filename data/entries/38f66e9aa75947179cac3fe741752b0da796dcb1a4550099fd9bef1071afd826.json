{"title":"MacRumors Giveaway: Win an iPad Air and Rock Paper Pencil Kit From Astropad","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/macrumors-giveaway-astropad-ipad-air-january/","date":1737140005000,"content":"For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href=\"https://astropad.com\">Astropad</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> Pro, and Astropad's best <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> accessory, the <a href=\"https://astropad.com/product/rock-paper-pencil\">Rock Paper Pencil</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/astropad-rock-paper-pencil-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nRock Paper Pencil is an all-in-one kit that features a textured screen protector and ‌Apple Pencil‌ tip. The two components of the kit make writing and drawing on the ‌iPad‌ feel like you're writing on a piece of paper instead of on a glossy display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/astropad-rock-paper-pencil-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nWriting or drawing on an ‌iPad‌ feels distinctly different from writing or drawing with a paper and a pen, and Rock Paper Pencil does a great job at making you forget you're using a tablet. It feels like writing on paper, and it also <em>sounds</em> like writing on paper.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/astropad-rock-paper-pencil-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe screen protector uses NanoCling technology so it adheres to an ‌iPad‌ using static cling, and it can be taken off and put back on as needed with no residue left on the ‌iPad‌'s screen. With NanoCling, the screen protector fits right up to the display of the ‌iPad‌ to provide a flat surface with no gaps or ridges. Because of the slight friction from the texture of the screen protector, there's much more control over stroke output.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/astropad-rock-paper-pencil-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nRock Paper Pencil's pencil tip fits on the ‌Apple Pencil‌ Pro (and other ‌Apple Pencil‌ models) and it can hold up to heavy daily use. The tip features a wear-resistant copper alloy core with a palladium exterior coating, and it is equivalent to an 0.7mm ballpoint pen for precision writing and sketching. Astropad includes two pencil tips with the kit, along with a protective storage sleeve so you can tuck away the screen protector when you're not using it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/astropad-rock-paper-pencil-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nPriced at $45, the <a href=\"https://shop.astropad.com/collections/shop-astropad/products/rock-paper-pencil\">Rock Paper Pencil kit</a> works with all of Apple's modern iPads, including the ‌iPad Air‌, both <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models, the sixth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, and the 7th-generation and later ‌iPad‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/astropad-rock-paper-pencil-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nWe have an ‌iPad Air‌ 2, Rock Paper Pencil, and ‌Apple Pencil‌ Pro for one lucky <em>MacRumors</em> reader.
