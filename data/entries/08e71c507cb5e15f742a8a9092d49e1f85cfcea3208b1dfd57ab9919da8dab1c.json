Amazon S3 is the world’s best place to build a data lake, with virtually unlimited scale, and it provides the essential foundation for this transformation.</p> \n<p>I’m always astonished to learn about the scale at which we operate Amazon S3: It currently holds over 400 trillion objects, exabytes of data, and processes a mind-blowing 150 million requests per second. Just a decade ago, not even 100 customers were storing more than a petabyte (PB) of data on S3. Today, thousands of customers have surpassed the 1 PB milestone.</p> \n<p>Amazon S3 stores exabytes of tabular data, and it averages over 15 million requests to tabular data per second. To help you reduce the undifferentiated heavy lifting when managing your tabular data in S3 buckets, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-s3-tables-storage-optimized-for-analytics-workloads/?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=el\">we announced Amazon S3 Tables at AWS re:Invent 2024</a>. S3 Tables are the first cloud object store with built-in support for Apache Iceberg. S3 tables are specifically optimized for analytics workloads, resulting in up to threefold faster query throughput and up to tenfold higher transactions per second compared to self-managed tables.</p> \n<p>Today, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-tables-integration-with-amazon-sagemaker-lakehouse-is-now-generally-available/?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=el\">we’re announcing the</a><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-tables-integration-with-amazon-sagemaker-lakehouse-is-now-generally-available/\"> general availability</a> of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/tables/?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=el\">Amazon S3 Tables</a> integration with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/lakehouse/?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=el\">Amazon SageMaker Lakehouse</a> </strong> <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/03/amazon-sagemaker-lakehouse-integration-s3-tables-generally-available/?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=el\">Amazon S3 Tables now integrate with Amazon SageMaker Lakehouse</a>, making it easy for you to access S3 Tables from AWS analytics services such as Amazon Redshift, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/athena\">Amazon Athena</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/emr\">Amazon EMR</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/glue/\">AWS Glue</a>, and Apache Iceberg–compatible engines such as Apache Spark or PyIceberg. SageMaker Lakehouse enables centralized management of fine-grained data access permissions for S3 Tables and other sources and consistently applies them across all engines.</p> \n<p>For those of you who use a third-party catalog, have a custom catalog implementation, or only need basic read and write access to tabular data in a single table bucket, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/03/amazon-s3-tables-apache-iceberg-rest-catalog-apis/?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=el\">we’ve added </a><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/03/amazon-s3-tables-apache-iceberg-rest-catalog-apis/?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=el\">new APIs</a> that are compatible with the <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/main/open-api/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml\">Iceberg REST Catalog standard</a></strong>. This enables any Iceberg-compatible application to seamlessly create, update, list, and delete tables in an S3 table bucket. For unified data management across all of your tabular data, data governance, and fine-grained access controls, you can also use S3 Tables with SageMaker Lakehouse.</p> \n<p>To help you access <strong>S3 Tables, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/03/amazon-s3-tables-create-query-table-s3-console/?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=el\">we’ve launched updates in the </a><a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com\">AWS Management Console</a></strong>. You can now create a table, populate it with data, and query it directly from the S3 console using Amazon Athena, making it easier to get started and analyze data in S3 table buckets.</p> \n<p>The following screenshot shows how to access Athena directly from the S3 console.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/03/09/2025-03-09_20-04-14.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/03/09/2025-03-09_20-04-14-1024x284.png\" alt=\"S3 console : create table with Athena\" width=\"1024\" height=\"284\" /></a>When I select <strong>Query tables with Athena</strong> or <strong>Create table with Athena</strong>, it opens the Athena console on the correct data source, catalog, and database.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/03/09/Athena-query-editor_Create-S3-table.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/03/09/Athena-query-editor_Create-S3-table-1024x384.png\" alt=\"S3 Tables in Athena\" width=\"1024\" height=\"384\" /></a></p> \n<p>Since re:Invent 2024, we’ve continued to add new capabilities to S3 Tables at a rapid pace. For example, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/01/amazon-s3-tables-schema-definition-createtable-api/?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=el\">we added schema definition support to the <code>CreateTable</code> API</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/01/amazon-s3-tables-10000-tables-bucket/\">you can now create up to 10,000 tables in an S3 table bucket</a>. We also launched S3 Tables into eight additional <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glossary/latest/reference/glos-chap.html#region\">AWS Regions</a>, with the most recent being Asia Pacific (Seoul, Singapore, Sydney) on March 4, with more to come.

It’s the fastest and easiest way to help you discover and understand your S3 data with automated, effortlessly-queried metadata that updates in near real time. S3 Metadata works with S3 object tags. Tags help you logically group data for a variety of reasons, such as to apply IAM policies to provide fine-grained access, specify tag-based filters to manage object lifecycle rules, and selectively replicate data to another Region. In Regions where S3 Metadata is available, you can capture and query custom metadata that is stored as object tags. To reduce the cost associated with object tags when using S3 Metadata, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/03/amazon-s3-reduces-pricing-object-tagging/?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=el\"><strong>Amazon S3 reduced pricing for S3 object tagging by 35 percent</strong></a> in all Regions, making it cheaper to use custom metadata.</p> \n<p><span><strong>AWS Pi Day 2025<br /> </strong></span>Over the years, AWS Pi Day has showcased major milestones in cloud storage and data analytics.
