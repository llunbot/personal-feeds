{"title":"iOS 18, Time Bandits, and everything else coming from Apple in July","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2381359/everything-coming-from-apple-july-2024-ios-18-macos-15-apple-tv-more.html","date":1719832500000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>With WWDC in the rearview mirror, the summer turns to updated beta releases as we march steadily toward September, when we expect all the new operating systems to arrive, along with, of course, new iPhones and Apple Watches. And we’lre also getting an exapansion of the international release of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-vision-pro-features-specs-price-faq.html\">Apple Vision Pro</a>, which launched in several countries in Asia late in June and will arrive in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the U.K. on July 12.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of the availability of Vision Pro in those new regions, all eyes are on iOS 18, macOS 15, and the other betas, which will begin their public beta testing in July. With that in mind, here’s everything we expect from Apple this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New hardware releases</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>July is tradionally a quite month for Apple, though a handful on new products have been released, including the MagSafe Battery Case (2021) and MacBook Air and MacBook Pro updates in 2019. However, with no Apple events on the calendar until September, we’re not expecting much in the way of new hardware this month. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The developer beta of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-ai-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS Sequoia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362011/watchos-11-watch-faces-fitness-vitals-translate.html\">watchOS 11</a>, iPadOS 18, and all the other OS updates for this year kicked off on the first day of WWDC in June. At the time, Apple said to expect a public beta in July—our best guess is the 2nd week of July—last year it arrived on Wednesday, July 12—but it could arrive at any time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of note is the absence of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a> or any of the new Siri features in the current developer beta. Those will launch this fall with a “beta” tag but they <em>are</em> supposed to be available for testing during the summer beta period. Will Apple Intelligence arrive with the public beta this month? Or in an update in a later beta release? Nobody really knows for sure, but we assume Apple is going to want some significant testing time before shipping these features to millions of iPhones, iPads, and Macs in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, there are a handful of iOS 18 features that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2365756/ios-18-features-not-available-at-launch.html\">won’t be available upon release in September</a>, so you shouldn’t expect to see them as part of the public betas this month, either.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Services</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple TV+</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the shows, series, and movies we expect to release on Apple TV+ in TK.
