The most recent of its announcements is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/250-analogue-3d-will-play-all-your-n64-cartridges-in-4k-early-next-year/\">the Analogue 3D</a>, a console designed to play Nintendo 64 cartridges.</p>\n<p>Now, a company called Retro Remake is reigniting the console wars of the 1990s with its <a href=\"https://retroremake.co/pages/superstation%E1%B5%92%E2%81%BF%E1%B5%89\">SuperStation one</a>, a new-old game console designed to play original Sony PlayStation games and work with original accessories like controllers and memory cards. Currently available <a href=\"https://retroremake.co/products/superstation%E1%B5%92%E2%81%BF%E1%B5%89\">as a $180 pre-order</a>, Retro Remake expects the consoles to ship no later than Q4 of 2025.</p>\n<p>The base console is modeled on the redesigned PSOne console from mid-2000, released late in the console's lifecycle to appeal to buyers on a budget who couldn't afford a then-new PlayStation 2. The Superstation one includes two PlayStation controller ports and memory card slots on the front, plus a USB-A port. But there are lots of modern amenities on the back, including a USB-C port for power, two USB-A ports, an HDMI port for new TVs, DIN10 and VGA ports that support analog video output, and an Ethernet port. Other analog video outputs, including component and RCA outputs, are located on the sides behind small covers. The console also supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/new-fpga-powered-retro-console-re-creates-the-playstation-one-cd-rom-drive-optional/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/new-fpga-powered-retro-console-re-creates-the-playstation-one-cd-rom-drive-optional/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"21bf7159139b1394b9ebbc7a023d7ca0da753ccc98b1b28ec80b17265c3b394b","category":"Tech"}
