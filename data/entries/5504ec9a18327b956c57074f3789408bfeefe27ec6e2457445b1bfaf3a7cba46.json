But one Waymo car that tried to navigate down a busy street in San Francisco's Chinatown was met with an unruly mob that smashed the car's windows and burned it to the ground over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Videos of the incident are all over social media. X user <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnirudhKoul/status/1756581434788307224\">Anirudh Koul</a> got good footage of what started the fire. In one video, a crowd of people surround the car, preventing it from moving. The vehicle is already covered in graffiti and has several smashed windows. One person then throws a lit firework into the cabin; the firework explodes and a fire starts inside the car. The Waymo car then burns to a crisp while it helplessly flashes its hazard lights.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Google's Waymo Autonomous car set on fire in San Francisco. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f97a.png\" alt=\"ðŸ¥º\" /></p>\n<p>1.
