The announcement came the same day that the World Health Organization announced that COVID <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/who-ends-covid-emergency-but-warns-threat-is-not-over/\">no longer constituted an emergency</a>, and Walensky's resignation letter made reference to that: “The end of the COVID-19 public health emergency marks a tremendous transition for our country, for public health, and in my tenure as CDC Director.”</p>\n<p>Walensky took on the directorship of the CDC at a very challenging time. The agency was dealing with a number of self-inflicted wounds, such as the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/04/cdcs-failed-coronavirus-tests-were-tainted-with-coronavirus-feds-confirm/\">failure of its initial tests</a> for SARS-CoV-2 and confused advice on the value of masks. Layered on top of that was a degree of political interference from a White House that wanted to minimize the risk and damage of the pandemic. This included the sidelining of CDC experts who gave <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/02/coronavirus-spread-in-us-not-if-but-when-and-how-severe-cdc-says/\">realistically grim</a> warnings at the start of the pandemic and the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/12/house-committee-details-political-interference-with-pandemic-response/\">editing of public health guidance</a> by White House political appointees. By the start of the Biden administration, the once-flagship public health organization had lost a lot of its credibility and suffered from severe morale problems.</p>\n<p>Walensky took on the task of restoring trust and reforming the agency, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/shake-up-at-cdc-walensky-acknowledges-pandemic-failure-plans-big-changes/\">starting a restructuring program</a> meant to get CDC to focus on getting the data needed to craft public health advice rather than generate academic publications. Better communication to the public was also a major goal of the reforms.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937127#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937127&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cbbb45a1d336bc78d0118eea77d080030ae12ed9872061f4f5fcfb5837fc1506","category":"Tech"}
