Apple says CarPlay will be tailored to each new vehicle model to accommodate unique screen shapes and layouts. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Widgets</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/CarPlay-Next-Generation-Widgets.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nWidgets will be a key part of the new CarPlay experience, offering at-a-glance information such as trip duration, fuel economy, distance traveled, calendar events, weather, phone calls, the status of a HomeKit-enabled garage door, and more. It will also be possible to view and scroll through the widgets within the instrument cluster.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>FM Radio App</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/CarPlay-Next-Generation-Radio.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"899\" />\r<br />\nThe new version of CarPlay will include an all-new Radio app that allows you to easily control the FM radio in your vehicle, such as to change the station.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/\">First Vehicles With Next-Generation Apple CarPlay Announced Ahead of 2024 Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-vehicles-with-next-generation-apple-carplay-announced-ahead-of-2024-launch.2414274/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cae72c0a79141937f22e09b980f7d0a476ef73123cf32bd3fdd4b41717315ef0","category":"Apple"}
