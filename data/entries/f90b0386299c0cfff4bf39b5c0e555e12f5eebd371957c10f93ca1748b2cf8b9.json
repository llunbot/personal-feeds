Cancer patients are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 and becoming severely ill. They also may not be able to mount a full immune response after being vaccinated against the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>\n<p>Ladapo had requested the meeting with Polsky in an effort to win Senate confirmation for his appointment, which <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/floridas-new-surgeon-general-skeptical-of-vaccines-opposes-masks/\">Gov. Ron DeSantis announced late last month</a>. Ladapo's appointment has drawn controversy, particularly from Democrats, because of his views on the pandemic and vocal opposition to public health measures. In a series of op-eds and public appearances, Ladapo has advocated for allowing the pandemic coronavirus to spread and signed onto the controversial <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrington_Declaration\">Great Barrington Declaration</a>. Meanwhile, he has stoked unfounded fears about vaccine safety, misrepresented evidence on mask effectiveness, and opposed mask mandates, vaccine mandates, quarantines for school children, and lockdowns.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1807203#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1807203&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f90b0386299c0cfff4bf39b5c0e555e12f5eebd371957c10f93ca1748b2cf8b9","category":"Tech"}
