Even if the act itself can be done (and undone, and redone), the friction of hauling out the gear, preparing a space, and fine-motor-skilling a perfect shiny blob can put a halt to one's tinkering ambitions.</p>\n<div><div></div><p>Arduino's Plug and Make Kit official release video. </p></div>\n<p>Arduino, the building block of many off-hours projects, has put the challenge to you, your kids, or anyone you know who just needs the right kit to fall down a rabbit hole, minus a dangerously hot iron. The <a href=\"https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/plug-and-make-kit?selectedStore=us\">Arduino Plug and Make Kit</a> has at its core an Arduino UNO R4 board with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a built-in 12×8 LED matrix display. That board gets screwed into the prime lot on a yellow board, and then you pick from among seven other \"Modulino\" boards to attach. By \"attach,\" I mean running one of those little push-in-with-your-fingers cables from the main board to a little board, and maybe daisy-chaining from there. All your boards fit onto the larger base with M3 screws and nuts, and the whole thing is powered by a USB-C cable (with USB A or C on the other end).</p>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AKX00069_00.default_1000x750-980x735.jpeg\" /></div>\n          <p>\n            The contents of Arduino's Plug and Make Kit.                      </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n<p>What can you plug in? A knob, eight LEDs, a proximity sensor, a motion sensor, a simple buzzer/speaker, a temperature/humidity sensor, and three simple buttons. With those things, the newcomer can make a low-key weather station, an 8-bit-style synthesizer, a smart lamp controller, and <a href=\"https://courses.arduino.cc/plugandmake/\">a few other things</a> (registration required). Of course, those are just the starter projects put together by Arduino; on the web, in the corners of GitHub, and inside the curious mind, there are loads of other things to be built.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036761#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036761&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"281d5c71a721f92c97790420112edd025fe29ce5a0fe75b0e0a93fa76bd6f087","category":"Tech"}
