Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> said:<blockquote>France occupies a special place in my heart. Every time I go there, I am inspired by this welcoming, dynamic and deeply creative community of artists and developers. I am delighted to celebrate Apple's 40th anniversary in France with our local teams and the customers and communities they serve.</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple began its business in France with a small sales team in 1981, and now has 2,700 employees, 20 Apple Stores, and almost 500 suppliers in the country. The company added that iOS now supports almost 250,000 jobs across France.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nStarting from 2019, Apple has partnered with Simplon to offer the Apple Foundation Program in France.
