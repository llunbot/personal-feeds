We first <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jrssnet/status/1445053044568244226\">noticed</a> the problem at about 11:30 am Eastern time, when some Facebook links stopped working. Investigating a bit further showed major DNS failures at Facebook:</p>\n<div><blockquote><p>So, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Facebook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@facebook</a>'s DNS is broken this morning...<br /><br />TL;DR: Google anycast DNS returns SERVFAIL for Facebook queries; querying <a href=\"https://t.co/0BDgaIHmlr\">https://t.co/0BDgaIHmlr</a> directly times out. <a href=\"https://t.co/3GHJ3mW0P0\">pic.twitter.com/3GHJ3mW0P0</a></p>— Jim Salter (@jrssnet) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jrssnet/status/1445053044568244226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 4, 2021</a></blockquote></div>\n<p>The problem goes deeper than Facebook's obvious <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/\">DNS</a> failures, though. Facebook-owned Instagram was also down, and its DNS services—which are hosted on Amazon rather than being internal to Facebook's own network—were functional. Instagram and WhatsApp were reachable but showed HTTP 503 (no server is available for the request) failures instead, an indication that while DNS worked and the services' load balancers were reachable, the application servers that should be feeding the load balancers were not.</p>\n<p>A bit later, Cloudflare VP Dane Knecht reported that all <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/\">BGP</a> routes for Facebook had been pulled. With no BGP routes into Facebook's network, Facebook's own DNS servers would be unreachable—as would the missing application servers for Facebook-owned Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus VR.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1800566#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1800566&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9e6c314501fa02aadea6af9a313d2430fdb1ea1f78aed98b0ff2d15f730d5556","category":"Tech"}
