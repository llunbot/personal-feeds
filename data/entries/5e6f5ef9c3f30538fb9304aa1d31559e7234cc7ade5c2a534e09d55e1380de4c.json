Through its \"Quick Add\" feature, Snapchat \"directed her\" to connect with \"a registered sex offender using the profile name JASONMORGAN5660.\" After a little more than a week on the app, C.O. was bombarded with inappropriate images and subjected to sextortion and threats before the adult user pressured her to meet up, then raped her. Cops arrested the adult user the next day, resulting in his incarceration, but his Snapchat account remained active for three years despite reports of harassment, the complaint alleged.</p>\n<p>Two years later, at 14, C.O. connected with another convicted sex offender on Snapchat, a former police officer who offered to give C.O. a ride to school and then sexually assaulted her. The second offender is also currently incarcerated, the judge's opinion noted.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005359#p3\">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005359&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5e6f5ef9c3f30538fb9304aa1d31559e7234cc7ade5c2a534e09d55e1380de4c","category":"Tech"}
