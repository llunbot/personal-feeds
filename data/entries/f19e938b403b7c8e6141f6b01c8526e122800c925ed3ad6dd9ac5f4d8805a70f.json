{"title":"‘Make Something Wonderful: Steve Jobs in His Own Words’","link":"https://stevejobsarchive.com/book","date":1681245298000,"content":"\n<p>New, from The Steve Jobs Archive:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A curated collection of Steve’s speeches, interviews and\ncorrespondence, Make Something Wonderful offers an unparalleled\nwindow into how one of the world’s most creative entrepreneurs\napproached his life and work. In these pages, Steve shares his\nperspective on his childhood, on launching and being pushed out of\nApple, on his time with Pixar and NeXT, and on his ultimate return\nto the company that started it all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From Laurene Powell Jobs’s introduction:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Steve once told a group of students, “You appear, have a chance to\nblaze in the sky, then you disappear.” He gave an extraordinary\namount of thought to how best to use our fleeting time. He was\ncompelled by the notion of being part of the arc of human\nexistence, animated by the thought that he — or that any of us — might elevate or expedite human progress.</p>\n\n<p>It is hard enough to see what is already there, to gain a clear\nview. Steve’s gift was greater still: he saw clearly what was not\nthere, what could be there, what had to be there. His mind was\nnever a captive of reality. Quite the contrary: he imagined what\nreality lacked and set out to remedy it. His ideas were not\narguments, but intuitions, born of a true inner freedom and an\nepic sense of possibility.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s a (very?) limited print edition that is not for sale, but is being given to Apple employees and others who were close to Jobs (such as Jony Ive’s team at LoveFrom, who clearly produced this work and the lovely apple tree logomark). It’s freely available <a href=\"http://apple.co/sja\">on Apple Books</a> (nice URL), but I think the best way to read it, if you’re not fortunate enough to have access to the printed book, is the website. It’s just lovely.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sdw/status/1645833999762472960\">Sebastiaan de With, on Twitter</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It’s hard to capture the delight of a real book, but this website\ndoes a fantastic job coming close. Lots delightful, thoughtful\nlittle details.</p>\n\n<p>I say ‘ebook’ because it isn’t a word used anywhere on the\nwebsite, likely for good reason: there are no good ebooks. The\nePub file lacks all the delight of the beautiful website. Books on\nApple Books are objectively worse than their written counterparts.\nThis might be nicer.</p>\n\n<p>Try jumping around using the ‘line of contents’. Super nice stuff.\nThe website even remembers where you left off.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/11/make-something-wonderful\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f19e938b403b7c8e6141f6b01c8526e122800c925ed3ad6dd9ac5f4d8805a70f","category":"Tech"}
