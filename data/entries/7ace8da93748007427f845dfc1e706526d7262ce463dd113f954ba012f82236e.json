Colnago made Gioiello number one even more limited, with a price reflecting that.</p>\n<p>The first bike in the Gioiello series just sold at auction house Sotheby’s for a staggering 120,650 CHF, or just over $133,000 USD. That makes it the most expensive Colnago ever sold, according to the brand.</p>\n<p>As alluded to before, part of what makes Gioiello number one even more exclusive is the inclusion of a single 2.3-carat diamond on the headset cap — befitting a bike whose name means “jewel.”</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Colnago-Gioiello-Numero1-Goldsmith-5.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"A 2-carat diamond being placed into the headset cap of a Colnago Gioiello road bike. \" width=\"1800\" height=\"1793\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Colnago-Gioiello-Numero1-Goldsmith-5.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Colnago-Gioiello-Numero1-Goldsmith-5.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption><span>The Colnago Gioiello number one features a 2.03-carat diamond.
