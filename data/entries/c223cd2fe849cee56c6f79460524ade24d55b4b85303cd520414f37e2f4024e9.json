Switch 2 just looks like a slightly bigger Switch. Pure joy.</p>\n\n<p>That it’s just a bigger faster Switch is proof of the genius of the Switch form factor, which has now been <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/\">widely</a> <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-steam-deck-alternatives\">copied</a> across the industry. The Switch is to handheld + dockable console gaming what the iPhone is to phones. They’re announcing compatibility with existing Switch games, including physical game cards, but with a footnote disclaiming “Certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2.” I suspect all major games will be fully compatible but some of the half-assed dreck available on the online Switch store might not be.</p>\n\n<p>It’s nothing short of glorious that, thanks to the Switch, Nintendo is thriving. Just about everything currently on my plate and on my mind to write about is some combination of <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/13/rory-sykes\">tragic</a>, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-makeup-photo-liv-gold-bedminster-1728985\">ugly</a>, <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/meta-deletes-trans-and-nonbinary-messenger-themes/\">hateful</a>, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/14/smith-special-counsel-report-vol-1\">worrisome</a>, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/14/breakfast-with-pete-hegseth\">more worrisome</a>, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/apple-meta-european-union-digital-markets-act-e759c245ae163efbd1bb06b1cb3cb147\">spiteful</a>, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/03/allen-tim-cook-1m-trump-inauguration\">corrupt</a>, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/11/google-donates-to-trump-inauguration-racket\">more corrupt</a>, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/15/noah-smith-tiktok-china\">contentious</a>, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/search/bezos+washington+post\">depressing</a>, or, <em>at best</em>, just plain <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@gruber/113827178760428345\">no fun at all</a>. But here’s Nintendo — perhaps the most humane company in the history of computing, and one that has never allowed either success or failure to distract it from its core mission of creating wholesome, clever, exquisitely well-designed fun games — with a much-anticipated announcement of something new that is purely about adding more joy to people’s lives. </p>\n\n<p>As Mario would say, “Woohoo!”</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-trailer\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c223cd2fe849cee56c6f79460524ade24d55b4b85303cd520414f37e2f4024e9","category":"Tech"}
