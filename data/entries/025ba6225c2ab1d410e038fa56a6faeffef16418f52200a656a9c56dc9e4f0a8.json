{"title":"Get the iPad Air for the same price as the 10th-gen iPad in this all-time-low sale","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2246495/apples-excellent-ipad-air-is-just-450-for-the-first-time-ever.html","date":1709310932000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Even at its full $599 retail price, the iPad Air is easy to recommend over the 10th-gen iPad for a variety of reasons. But today it’s impossible not to recommend since it’s the same price as its cheaper sibling: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09V3KXJPB/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the 64GB iPad Air in every color for $450</a>, a savings of $150 and the best price we’ve ever seen for the 64GB model, which is usually on sale for $499.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad Air has a 10-.9-inch Liquid Retina display and is ready for anything with an M1 chip, a 12MP front camera with Center Stage, Apple Pencil 2 support, USB-C, and Touch ID. Its gorgeous all-screen design isn’t expected to change and we don’t think there will be all that much to worry about missing out on other than a faster chip and better cameras.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even without an update in nearly two years, we think the iPad Air is one of the best tablets ever made and perfect for just about any task. In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/625135/ipad-air-m1-review.html\">4.5-star review</a>, we called the iPad Air “a Pro in all but name” and praised its design and performance. And at this price, it’s a better bargain than Apple’s 10th-gen iPad—so go grab one before the price jumps back up.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"025ba6225c2ab1d410e038fa56a6faeffef16418f52200a656a9c56dc9e4f0a8","category":"Apple"}
