The geometry feels familiar and predictable. It seems like a perfect gravel/all-road bike for the beginner or an intermediate rider.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-drivetrain.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-drivetrain.webp\" alt=\"2025 State Bicycles 4130 All Road drivetrain\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-drivetrain.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-drivetrain-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-drivetrain-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-drivetrain-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-drivetrain-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-drivetrain-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo / Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The house-brand components look clean and kick the 4130 All-Road’s aesthetics up a notch.

I’ve put over 1000 miles on those levers, and they never missed a shift. Not once. So, I will say that I have no reason to believe that the Sensah shift/brake levers on the new 4130 All-Road would be any different. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-after-the-build.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-after-the-build.webp\" alt=\"2025 State Bicycles 4130 All Road after the build\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-after-the-build.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-after-the-build-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-after-the-build-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-after-the-build-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo / Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-heading-down-for-a-ride.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-heading-down-for-a-ride.webp\" alt=\"2025 State Bicycles 4130 All Road heading down for a ride\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-heading-down-for-a-ride.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-heading-down-for-a-ride-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-heading-down-for-a-ride-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-heading-down-for-a-ride-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-heading-down-for-a-ride-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-heading-down-for-a-ride-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo / Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve only had a few rides on it so far. But, I found the bars that came on the new All-Road to be very comfy. The flare was more than I’m used to, but otherwise felt great. I have yet to do any techy descending, but I’m confident that the bike will behave predictably. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-from-the-back.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-from-the-back.webp\" alt=\"2025 State Bicycles 4130 All Road from the back\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-from-the-back.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-from-the-back-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-from-the-back-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-from-the-back-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-from-the-back-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-State-Bicycles-4130-All-Road-from-the-back-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The price for this entry-level to intermediate gravel bike seems to offer a ton of bang for your buck with these new upgrades. That being said, I will keep this bike on hand and get some more rides in… then let you know what I think. But, I have high hopes that it will prove itself to be a great bike for a great price.
