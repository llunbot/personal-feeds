It checks for the latest viral definitions and sets up real-time scanning features and intuitive network monitoring, allowing users to see and work with both incoming and outgoing Internet connections on their Mac.</p>\n\n<p>Mac Security X9 offers impressive configuration and customization for the VirusBarrier and NetBarrier tools. VirusBarrier performs well in protecting users from viruses, while NetBarrier acts as a firewall that protects connections. The application allows users to create settings for home, work, or public connections, and allows or deny connections as needed.</p>\n\n<p>There are some issues to address, we’d like to see a running counter tracking the number of files processed in a VirusBarrier scan and we were disappointed that it allowed traffic to questionable websites linked to spam messages. </p>\n\n<p>Mac Internet Security X9 doesn’t try to upsell users to Intego’s other suites and services. The tools in place are effective, work well, and make this utility worth considering. Best of all, Intego Mac Internet Security is built for Mac and is easy to set up and easy to use.

A Smart Scan feature checks your virus definitions to make sure they’re up to date and scans for viruses and malware. A Ransomware Shield, Network Inspector, and Fake Website Shield features look things over to see where you stand in terms of your overall online presence and security. The set of whitelists and exceptions can be customized to hone in on files you want to scan and leave out areas you want to leave alone. </p>\n\n<p>Scans on external drives and specific folders are easy to set up and execute, the scheduling feature works well, the software can set up location configurations, and there are customization options for network security. A quick antiviral scan took a few minutes while a full scan of an entire NVME drive with 821GB of data on it took just over 5.5 hours to complete.</p>\n\n<p>Our tests with malware and phishing-based websites went well. The software, combined with macOS’s Gatekeeper functionality to stop the vast majority of malware installations, quarantining them quickly and preventing installation. The software also prevented questionable external code from being loaded on suspect websites and blocked phishing sites from loading.</p>\n\n<p>AVG Internet Security for Mac caught an impressive amount of viral, phishing, and malware activity and did its job well, all while wrapped in a bright, friendly user interface that’s easy to navigate.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few places for improvement with AVG Internet Security for Mac. One criticism is that the scheduled scan feature doesn’t readily display that the scan is taking place. Also, during testing, the software allowed a fake version of Adobe Flash Player to be installed. If you do override the macOS Gatekeeper and AVG security features and install malware, AVG Internet Security does a good job of removing it.</p>\n\n<p>Have a look at its 60-day trial to see what works for you.

The Traffic Monitor shows data usage and bandwidth usage, while Network Inspector scans the network for safety and alerts users when unfamiliar devices join the network. Core Shields prevents fake websites from loading and triggering software.</p>\n\n<p>The main frustration with Avast Premium Security is its subscription-based model, but that tends to be standard these days.

It is simple to use; once you’ve walked through the guided steps for assigning permissions to work behind the scenes you can just leave it to get on with its job.</p>\n\n<p>The software can perform a full scan of your hard drive as well as scan custom locations such as external volumes, and schedule scan times. You can control what Total Protection does when it finds suspect files, such as notifying you, quarantining them, or deleting the files. During our tests, it located and quarantined two suspected virus files I didn’t know about, thereby earning its keep.</p>\n\n<p>Other features include an ID Protection tool that compares your email address to known data and password breaches, a firewall, and a Secure VPN feature that lets you quickly set up a Virtual Private Network (VPN).</p>\n\n<p>McAfee’s Total Protection package extends up to five devices on one account, so it’s easy to add the app to other Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Android-based phones and tablets as needed. It’s worth noting that the Windows version offers features that you don’t get in the Mac app.</p>\n\n<p>We noted some occasional performance impacts as it ran in the background, but it was largely unobtrusive in its efforts. Our only other grumble is the lack of simplicity in ending the trial.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100470607-15084646\">You can get McAfee Total Protection here</a>. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668090/mcafee-total-protection-review-3.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMcAfee Total Protection review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6.

It provides protection in Mac OS X 10.10 or later. The Standard package protects one device. For more devices (including Macs, iPhones or PCs), the Deluxe or Select package are required. The software offers 110GB of cloud-based backup, a password manager, a basic VPN client, and Dark Web monitoring.</p>\n\n<p>Within Norton 360 for Mac you’ll find a Startup Manager module, File Cleanup module, and Dark Web protection module. With antiviral monitoring and scanning it’s easy to create white lists and exceptions as well as schedule scans, including of external volumes like USB thumb drives. However, the application still can’t perform scans on .zip files, I had to decompress the text drive of sample infections before it could see them. </p>\n\n<p>The VPN is basic but easy to configure your preferred country of origin and initiate a connection. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668938/best-password-managers-2.html\">password manager</a> is reliable and includes a downloadable recovery key. There is an admirable level of possible customization on the firewall, although technical knowledge is needed.</p>\n\n<p>In our tests, the software was successful in catching a good amount of viral activity, with 25 individual infections detected on a test drive after scanning it.

Each module can be customized and configured as needed. The software installs cleanly and requests permission to fully access the hard drive. </p>\n\n<p>The Quick Scan can take less than 10 seconds, while a Full Scan took over six hours to look over 800+ gigabytes of files on a one terabyte SSD. The Custom Scan feature allows files and folders to be dropped in for quick scanning as well as external volumes to be scanned through as needed. There is a scheduler so you can program scans in advance.</p>\n\n<p>You can minimize Avira Prime and work with other applications as the scan continues which is lucky because the Full Scan took over six hours to complete. Avira Prime located and quarantined several minor worm files, but missed suspect files such as the Wave web browser, which has been implicated in assorted phishing scams.</p>\n\n<p>Cookie Cleaner module allows you to view and clean up cookie data, helpfully grouping cookies into different categories to make it easy to remove tracking and ads-based items in different browsers. Junk Cleaner reclaimed a decent 55GB of space when we tried it. There’s also an uninstaller manager for cleaning up deleted apps and managing those that start automatically. </p>\n\n<p>Identity Assistant can track your email addresses, phone numbers, credit cards, bank accounts, physical addresses, driver’s license, and so on, to check for any illicit activity. The included Password Manager is a combination of local system and browser extensions plus a web-based management console with its own master password.</p>\n\n<p>The password manager and junk files cleaner are included in both free and paid-for versions of Avira. Where Prime differs from the Free Security version is that you get full, use of the VPN service instead of a 500MB per month limit. The VPN can also block malicious website content.</p>\n\n<p>You can get <a href=\"https://www.avira.com\" target=\"_blank\">Avira Prime here.</a> Also consider <a href=\"https://www.avira.com/en/free-security\" target=\"_blank\">Avira Free Security for Mac</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668094/avira-free-security-for-mac-review.html\">Avira Free Security for Mac review</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AV Test, December 2024: 99.5%</li>\n</ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668098/avira-prime-for-mac-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAvira Prime review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8.

The range of functions seems quite limited compared to competitors such as Norton and Avast. For example, there is no anti-phishing function and no VPN application included in the package.</p>\n\n<p>There are five menu items: Overview, Web, Scans, Folder Shield, and Logs. Overview is the at-a-glance dashboard for Trend Micro Antivirus that shows that the various protections are active, the last time the app was updated and the last time a scan was run. </p>\n\n<p>Trend Micro offers a smart scan, custom scan, and full scan.

The question is whether if you use CleanMyMac for it’s primary purpose, will it also protect you from malware?</p>\n\n<p>Looking at CleanMyMac as an antivirus tool, we found that the software offers a good level of customization, and it’s easy to choose between the three scan modes (Quick Scan, Balanced Scan, and Deep Scan), each of them offering quick performance as CleanMyMac scans your hard drive and external drives. It’s also easy to configure scan behaviors, such as whether or not to include external drives in your scans or target .DMG files, and whitelists can also be created to exclude specific volumes and folders from the scans.</p>\n\n<p>In our tests results were mixed though. The software teamed up well with macOS’ GateKeeper feature, stopping questionable software that hasn’t been signed as safe by Apple from being installed, but it was still possible to get a fair amount of malware past these systems and on to our Mac.</p>\n\n<p>The Quick Scan feature caught two elements from CrossRat and a threat in the form of the infamous AdWind malware.

In the past Sophos offered a free version of its Home product with just the antivirus protection and website protection. That was discontinued in late 2021. There is a free 30-day trial.</p>\n\n<p>We had some issues installing and getting the software set up. Everything is controlled via the Menu Bar icon and a web-based dashboard and it’s not always clear it is running.</p>\n\n<p>Once you’ve signed in, it’s easy enough to customize and configure core elements such as actions that occur when malware is found, scan scheduling, and web filtering, and elements such as accessible scan logs and network file scanning.</p>\n\n<p>You can choose between quick scans and full scans, which can take several hours and cover the full extent of the hard drive. While the scan scheduling feature worked well, it only allows you to set schedule times set to every 30 minutes (11:00 AM, 11:30 AM, 12:00 PM, etc). Scanning an external volume such as a thumb drive or network volume feels is harder than it should.</p>\n\n<p>You can configure Web Filtering options to allow blocking for certain categories, such as adult content. The filters work reasonably well and it’s easy enough to create a whitelist to provide exceptions.</p>\n\n<p>There’s room for improvement. Although Sophos Home Premium functions well with macOS’s GateKeeper feature and caught and filtered a respectable amount of test malware, it allowed the AdWind malware and an infected copy of Adobe Flash Player to be installed.

There is also a free antivirus from Malwarebytes which we look at here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2603909/malwarebytes-free-antivirus-review.html\">Malwarebytes Free Antivirus Review.</a></p>\n\n<p>Malwarebytes Premium builds on the free version of <a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download\">Malwarebytes</a>, which is reasonably good at hunting down and removing some of the peskiest viruses and malware, but was thwart with bugs and crashes when we tested it. </p>\n\n<p>The paid-for version sports a bright, friendly user interface and a good array of features. It includes quick viral scans, functional scheduling for scans, decent customization elements including whitelist creation, a good VPN client, and Real-Time protection that keeps an eye on what’s attempting to be installed.</p>\n\n<p>The software performed well, offering speedy scans. Malwarebytes was able to quarantine and remove almost all the malware I installed, although it left elements behind such as the controversial Wave web browser, an incompatible version of MacSecurity, and a fake Adobe Album application.</p>\n\n<p>The VPN isn’t as customizable as a dedicated VPN client, but it performs well and gets the job done. See our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/331856/malwareybtes-privacy-vpn.html\" target=\"_blank\">review of the Malwarebytes VPN</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There doesn’t seem to be a custom scan element that allows you to easily scan an external volume such as a thumb drive, and the Real-Time Protection feature doesn’t kick in and scan an external volume once it’s mounted, nor can you drag and drop a volume into Malwarebytes for it to scan – which you can do in the Windows version of Malwarebytes. Malwarebytes offers no warnings against questionable websites and links either. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/700984/malwarebytes-premium-for-macs-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMalwarebytes Premium Security review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>Best Free Mac Antivirus </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for a free antivirus for Mac?

We have also reviewed the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667683/total-av-antivirus-review.html\">Total AV Antivirus Pro</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/article/2370689/eset-home-security-premium-review.html\">Eset Home Security</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2290949/total-defense-antivirus-for-mac-review.html\">Total Defense Antivirus for Mac</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233228/clamxav-review-2.html\">ClamXav</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668100/f-secure-total-review.html\">F-Secure Total for Mac</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we test Mac Antivirus</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We thoroughly test all Mac antivirus products from a usability and functionality perspective and use a combination of our own testing data and AV Comparatives/AV-Test lab data to ascertain which is the most reliable and trustworthy security product for your Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We consider the strength of protection against threats (online and offline), and how well it addresses the ever-expanding types of attacks. We spend time using the software. Ease of use and user interface is important because if the software is too complicated people will not use it, it should be easy to find the tools users need, and alerts should make sense and be relevant. Equally performance really matters because if an app slows down your Mac you are likely to turn that app off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also look at the features on offer. The best antivirus suites go beyond the basics of real-time protection and deeper scans, adding features like password managers and firewalls, some incorporate a VPN. However, we do assess whether these extras are helpful, or just unnecessary additions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also evaluate pricing, which more often than not comes in the form of an annual subscription with different tiers of features. We advice on the best options based on value for money. We also track the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673359/antivirus-deals.html\">best Antivirus for Mac deals. </a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why you can trust Macworld’s antivirus experts </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Macworld has been here testing Mac software since our conception alongside the launch of the Mac in 1984, so we know Macs better than anyone. When it comes to antivirus apps we recognise that despite Apple’s built-in systems to combat the threat of malware, in the current climate there is value in adding an extra layer of protection, to that end we continually evaluate the best Mac antivirus software. Our Mac antivirus software reviewers have worked in the industry for decades and have experience working with clients and fixing their problems. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to choose the best Antivirus for Mac </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of Mac antivirus programs to choose from. What you want is one that offers a familiar and easy to use interface that works well on a Mac – which is one reason why we recommend Intego’s antivirus.  You should also look for antivirus with a good detection rate – not just for Mac viruses, but crucially for PC viruses, unless you want to be passing viruses onto Windows using friends and clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other things that make one antivirus better than another is the low use of systen resorces – especially if your Mac isn’t the most powerful model out there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another factor is the type and number of devices you want to protect – are you looking for an app to cover one Mac, or Mac, iPhone, iPad and even a PC? Your budget will also be a factor. Do you want to tie into a subscription model or would you prefer a one-time payment? Some antivirus apps do still offer this. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Mac Antivirus: Specs Comparison</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Developer</strong></th><th><strong>Product name</strong></th><th><strong>USB scan</strong></th><th><strong>Ransomware protection</strong></th><th><strong>Adware prevention</strong></th><th><strong>Anti phishing  protection</strong></th><th><strong>Email protection</strong></th><th><strong>Firewall</strong></th><th><strong>VPN</strong></th><th><strong>iOS version</strong></th><th><strong>Parental Controls</strong></th><th><strong>Support</strong></th><th><strong>Trial</strong></th><th><strong>Price</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Intego</strong></td><td>Internet Security X9</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>7 days</td><td>$49.99/£49.99 / ye ($24.99/£20.99 /yr deal)</td></tr><tr><td>AVG</td><td>AntiVirus for Mac</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>60 days</td><td>Free (Paid for version is $2.49 per month for one year / $2.39 a month for two-years / $2.29 a month for three-years)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Norton </strong></td><td>360 Deluxe</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>30 days</td><td>$39.99/£34.99/yr</td></tr><tr><td><strong>McAfee</strong></td><td>Total Protection </td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>30 days</td><td>$34.99/£34.99/yr</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Avast </strong></td><td>Premium Security</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>60 days</td><td>$44.99/£39.99/yr</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitdefender</strong></td><td>Total Security </td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>30 days</td><td>$39.97/£34.99/yr</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eset </strong></td><td>Cyber Security Pro </td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>30 days</td><td>$49.95/£39.95/yr</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Trend Micro</strong></td><td>Antivirus for Mac</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>30 days</td><td>$39.99/£49.95</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Avira </strong></td><td>Prime</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>30 days</td><td>$99.99/£85.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Mac Antivirus: Buying Advice</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><h2> FAQ </h2><hr />\n<div><div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>Do Macs need antivirus software?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>Plenty of Mac users will tell you that Apple computers are inherently secure and don’t require protection. We’d argue that they are wrong, or at very least overconfident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668710/how-secure-mac.html\" target=\"_blank\">Macs are generally more secure</a> than their Windows brethren because macOS is a Unix-based operating system, which means it is sandboxed. This is like having a series of fire doors: even if malware gains access to your Mac, it is unable to spread to other areas of the machine. But while they are more difficult to exploit than Windows PCs, it is not impossible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676327/silver-sparrow-malware-detected-on-m1-macs-what-you-need-to-know.html\">Silver Sparrow malware</a> was detected on Macs powered by the M1 processor and infected hundreds of thousands of Macs. And it’s just one example – there have been many more since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can read more about this topic in our article <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670537/do-macs-need-antivirus.html\" target=\"_blank\">do Macs need antivirus?</a> More general advice can be found in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1432223/mac-security-tips-password-find-my-users-lockdown-mode.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mac security tips</a>; and those who have been hit by a malware attack should see <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671430/how-remove-virus-mac.html\" target=\"_blank\">how to remove a virus from a Mac</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>2.</span>\n<h3>What features should I look for in Mac antivirus?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>All Mac antivirus software packages find viruses using both on-demand- and always-on protection. The former examines individual files either during scheduled scans or when you decide to run one. This can take a long time, especially if you have a lot of files, and some antivirus products will hog your Mac’s processor power to prioritize the scan, so it’s worth selecting a convenient time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always-on malware protection protects you when a scan is not currently active. If malware arrives – perhaps via an email or a downloaded file – your antivirus software should detect and quarantine it. Quarantining a file involves moving it to a safe folder, allowing you to decide what to do with it. You’ll typically receive a notification of the discovered malware, but some Mac antivirus products can be more informative than others in these notifications (something we keep in mind in our testing).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The effectiveness of this on-demand and always-on virus protection is absolutely the most important thing when it comes to choosing Mac antivirus, but additional features may also affect your choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many Mac security suites now include ransomware protection. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts your files and demands a fee to decrypt them. An anti-ransomware feature will typically block any app from writing to a user’s home folders, such as Documents or Photos, unless that app has been whitelisted. Some apps, such as Microsoft Word, are pre-approved, and you can whitelist any that you trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Web protection via browser plugins or extensions is also a common component and aims to stop you (or your children) from visiting infected websites or handing over personal information when you shouldn’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Different vendors offer different add-ons, and it is certainly a case of you get what you pay for: free products will have fewer bells and whistles, but the most comprehensive Mac security suites will include password managers, parental controls, cloud storage and more. The underlying antimalware engine will usually be the same for all security products from a particular company, so you can save money if you don’t need all those extra features.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>3.</span>\n<h3>Should my Mac antivirus include a VPN?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>One of the add-ons you might find with Mac security products, although also commonly sold separately, is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668698/best-vpn-for-mac-2.html\">Mac VPN</a> (virtual private network). For many users, these are of interest because they can mask your location and allow you to view things (like streaming series) that are otherwise off-limits in your location. But they also have a very real benefit for security, protecting your internet connection by encrypting it, which is especially useful when using public Wi-Fi networks. In this day and age we should all be using VPNs and, while we’d recommend buying a dedicated Mac VPN product, one built into your antivirus software is better than nothing – just be prepared to be nagged to upgrade to the full product.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>4.</span>\n<h3>What is the best value Mac antivirus?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>Value is perceived differently by all users: for some the best value Mac antivirus is the free one, and for others, it is the one that is affordable but includes the most useful add-ons. We prefer to consider value in terms of which is the best all-round offering, rather than the budget deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, there are ways you can save money even on the more expensive products. Bear in mind that all antivirus for Mac apps are sold as yearly subscriptions, and often the first year has a hefty discount. When that first year is up, there’s nothing stopping you switching to another product and benefiting from that discount again. Alternatively, opt for a three- or even five-year subscription to save even more money – and why not: it’s not like viruses are going to disappear in the meantime and you won’t need it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the best Mac antivirus products can also cater to your other devices – and not just iPads and iPhones, but also Windows and Android devices. If you have multiple devices in your household, this can present a huge saving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at our recommendations of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673359/antivirus-deals.html\" target=\"_blank\">Best Mac Antivirus deals</a>, which includes the cheapest options.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>5.</span>\n<h3>How to spot fake Mac antivirus software?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>Because many of us are waking up to the idea that malware is a threat to the Mac, malware writers have made it their business to play on that fear. There have been cases of malware writers disguising their viruses as antivirus apps – two notable examples are Mac Auto Fixer and MacDefender. It’s important to always read reviews on reputable sites such as Macworld before installing any software on your Mac or MacBook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, don’t believe everything you read. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/552819/mackeeper-review.html\">MacKeeper</a> is a great example of an antivirus program that has got a bad rap, but it’s worked hard to repair its reputation. It has gained Apple Notarization, which means the software has been checked by Apple for malicious components, and the company has garnering certification from various bodies to prove it isn’t a PUP (potentially unwanted program), including an AV-Test certificate. That said, we haven’t recommended it here, and that’s simply because we feel that there are better options available. If you have already installed MacKeeper and wish to try one of our alternative recommendations, we explain <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/224718/how-to-uninstall-mackeeper-from-your-mac.html\" target=\"_blank\">How to uninstall MacKeeper</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>6.</span>\n<h3>What can’t Mac antivirus protect from?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>Using a Mac antivirus product, especially one that includes tools to improve your online privacy, may lull you into believing you’re completely safe from personal and private information leaking out and that you no longer need to keep your wits about you. That’s not quite the case. While there’s no reason to panic, you should still practice caution – and there are a few more issues you should consider when using Mac antivirus, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, an antivirus for Mac product may upload the complete text of files flagged to the cloud, where it can be analyzed by separate tools hosted there. This practice is normal and sensible: some malware can detect when a running process may examine it, and will then engage in subterfuge. Antivirus software makers also can access their massive databases to examine files with characteristics that trigger their algorithms – certain elements that match known malware. As a result, security researchers discover new viruses, worms, Trojans horses, and the like. However, helping the greater good means you’ll have to be comfortable with trusting a third-party with your file contents. Where appropriate, we noted privacy policy issues in individual reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, this software may also rely partly or entirely on cloud-based checks of URLs, malware, and the like. Accordingly, an antivirus package might upload every URL you visit, metadata about files, signatures of files, information about your computer’s hardware, a list of running or installed applications, and more. Companies vary on their disclosure of such policies, and may not let you opt out of this kind of sharing. We note issues in each review as appropriate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third, antivirus software makers also get a sense of what behavior is happening on your computer that’s being monitored or blocked, and may use that information for their own purposes. In some cases, you can opt out of this information gathering.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>7.</span>\n<h3>How we test Mac antivirus software </h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>Each software package is evaluated by creating a clean installation of macOS, cloning it for each antivirus product, and then booting separately into each one to install a different package. This is to ensure that previous app installations don’t interfere with new ones – sometimes antivirus software treats other antivirus software as an infection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to visiting malicious websites, downloading known malicious software, and even running said malware on our Mac, we also reference the most recent reports from two labs that regularly cover macOS malware: <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=http://www.av-comparatives.org/&amp;xcust=1-1-231118-1-0-0%7Cxid:fr1630002835232gbh&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/231118/best-antivirus-for-mac.html\">AV Comparatives</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.av-test.org/&amp;xcust=1-1-231118-1-0-0%7Cxid:fr1630002835232bgc&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/231118/best-antivirus-for-mac.html\">AV-TEST</a>. These laboratories test antivirus software against sets of known malware as well as products that are grouped as potentially unwanted applications (like adware).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latter doesn’t damage or expose your computer or its files but may consume power and CPU cycles. Because the testing effectively looks at a combination of virus databases and behavior, they remain good gauges even after many months. When an antivirus for Mac software package lacks a rating from a known security research lab, we do more extensive testing with real malware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, while we gave props for a lot of different features and behaviors, we mark down products if they lack any or all of the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A nearly perfect score on macOS malware detection</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ransomware monitoring</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Native browser plug-in or system-level Web proxy</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A high score on Windows malware detection</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5b95bd07047ab677b02d2bafe18e94e48e1ad6725b1b3c4533fdf8e211b98ae3","category":"Apple"}
