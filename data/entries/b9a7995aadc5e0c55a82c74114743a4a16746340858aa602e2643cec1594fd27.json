Open source models hallucinated the most, with 21 percent of the dependencies linking to non-existent libraries. A dependency is an essential code component that a separate piece of code requires to work properly. Dependencies save developers the hassle of rewriting code and are an essential part of the modern software supply chain.</p>\n<h2>Package hallucination flashbacks</h2>\n<p>These non-existent dependencies represent a threat to the software supply chain by exacerbating so-called dependency confusion attacks. These attacks work by causing a software package to access the wrong component dependency, for instance by publishing a malicious package and giving it the same name as the legitimate one but with a later version stamp. Software that depends on the package will, in some cases, choose the malicious version rather than the legitimate one because the former appears to be more recent.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/ai-generated-code-could-be-a-disaster-for-the-software-supply-chain-heres-why/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/ai-generated-code-could-be-a-disaster-for-the-software-supply-chain-heres-why/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b9a7995aadc5e0c55a82c74114743a4a16746340858aa602e2643cec1594fd27","category":"Tech"}
