Introducing the new Viral Bikes Dérive. The new Dérive will feature updated geo and design cues from the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pre-orders-are-open-for-viral-bikes-wild-new-wanderer-drop-bar-adventure-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Wanderer</a> Drop Bar Adventure Bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The titanium <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?p=371463&amp;preview=true&amp;_thumbnail_id=371470\" target=\"_blank\">Dérive</a> is also now being offered with a complete spec that includes Chris King wheels and headset, One-Up dropper post, stem, and handlebars, a Rock Shox Pike Ultimate or Viral Carbon Boost rigid fork, and SRAM Level Ultimate 4 piston disc brakes. The pricing below includes the Smart Shift system, but a manual version is available upon request.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Derive-Disc-Side-Profile-Pike.jpg\"><img width=\"12500\" height=\"5417\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Derive-Disc-Side-Profile-Pike.jpg\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Viral Bikes)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the bike was originally launched in 2019, the Dérive has been Viral Bike’s most popular model. Considered by some (Bikepacking.com and The Radavist) to be “the ultimate bikepacking bike”.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Derive-Three-Quarter-Shot-Pike.jpg\"><img width=\"12500\" height=\"5417\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Derive-Three-Quarter-Shot-Pike.jpg\" alt=\"Dérive Three Quarter Shot Pike\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Viral Bikes says that they have two Dérives that are currently being used on an around-the-world adventure and have traversed almost all of Europe. In fact, they are currently heading to South Ireland, on their way to Spain, so they can cross over into Africa via Morocco. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Check out this Teaser Vid</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dérive’s updated geo is designed around 29″ wheels only. Plus, there is internal routing for the bike’s rear brake and rear dynamo light. Both of these factors help the Dérive look more refined.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Derive-Head-Tube-Detail.jpg\"><img width=\"12500\" height=\"5417\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Derive-Head-Tube-Detail.jpg\" alt=\"Dérive Head Tube Detail\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Viral Bikes considers the Dérive their “do-it-all, bikepacking, backcountry, all country, made for anything. It can run a rigid fork or a 120mm suspension fork. It sports multiple mounting points for everything from fenders and racks to three water bottles on all sizes of frames. There’s even a three-pack mount on the bottom of the down tube and a “gas tank” mount on the top of the top tube. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Derive-SS-Bridge-Detail.jpg\"><img width=\"12500\" height=\"5417\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Derive-SS-Bridge-Detail.jpg\" alt=\"Dérive SS Bridge Detail\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Being this versatile means that the Dérive can be used for anything from your weekly mountain bike ride to the Tour Divide. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Derive-Drive-Side-Drop-Out-Detail.jpg\"><img width=\"12500\" height=\"5417\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Derive-Drive-Side-Drop-Out-Detail.jpg\" alt=\"Dérive Drive Side Drop Out Detail\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Viral Bikes Dérive comes standard with the new Pinion Smart.Shift electronic shifting system. Both the wires and the battery for the system are internally hidden and protected. But, if you’d rather have the Pinon mechanical shifting system, just let Viral know when ordering.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dérive Geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Viral-Bikes-Derive-frame-geo-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"2396\" height=\"1384\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Viral-Bikes-Derive-frame-geo-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Viral Bikes Derive frame geo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Viral-Bikes-Derive-frame-geo-jpeg.webp 2396w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Viral-Bikes-Derive-frame-geo-297x172.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Viral-Bikes-Derive-frame-geo-1536x887.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Viral-Bikes-Derive-frame-geo-120x69.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Viral-Bikes-Derive-frame-geo-768x444.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Viral-Bikes-Derive-frame-geo-2048x1183.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Viral-Bikes-Derive-geometry-numbers-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"2256\" height=\"873\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Viral-Bikes-Derive-geometry-numbers-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Viral Bikes Derive geometry numbers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Viral-Bikes-Derive-geometry-numbers-jpeg.webp 2256w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Viral-Bikes-Derive-geometry-numbers-297x115.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Viral-Bikes-Derive-geometry-numbers-1536x594.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Viral-Bikes-Derive-geometry-numbers-120x46.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Viral-Bikes-Derive-geometry-numbers-768x297.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Viral-Bikes-Derive-geometry-numbers-2048x793.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dérive Retail and Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $5,595 frame and drivetrain kit with Smart.Shift</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Viral Bikes triple butted titanium tubeset </li>\n\n\n\n<li>29” x 2.6” tire clearance</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pinion C1.12 gearbox delivers 600% gear range, that’s 80% more gear range than the new SRAM 1×12 system</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The manual Gearbox comes with a Gates belt drive, front and rear cogs, CNC cranks, DS2 shifter, lockring tool, and rear cassette spacer kit (<em>available upon request)</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li>SmartShift Gearbox comes with Gates belt drive, front and rear cogs, forged cranks, TE1 trigger shifter, battery, charger, wiring kit, locking tool, and rear cassette spacer kit</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rigid or 120mm fork compatible</li>\n\n\n\n<li>31.6mm seat post, compatible with internal dropper post routing.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>148mm Boost rear hub spacing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>IS41 upper/ IS52 lower headset bearings</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4.25 lbs. for medium frame</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Get your 10% discount by ordering your Dérive today, plus check out the other offerings that Viral Bikes has by hitting the link below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://viral.bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Viral.Bike.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/viral-bikes-derive-pinion-smart-shift-titanium-bikepacking-bike/\">The New Viral Bikes Dérive with Pinion Smart.Shift is Ready for Anything</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"f6147d75f1f7b790c7151f4a82ada339539e65fff905e003a8e02fc939a3e498","category":"Cycling"}
