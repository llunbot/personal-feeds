These include new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models with OLED displays, two new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> models, and new 13-inch and 15-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRumored accessories that we could see before then include at least one new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>, and new color options for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> cases and Apple Watch bands. A new Magic Keyboard for the ‌iPad Pro‌ with a larger trackpad is also said to be imminent, but Apple is unlikely to launch this prior to new ‌iPad Pro‌ models being announced.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOne other outlying possibility is a new color option for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus, although this has not been rumored and is only based on the timing of previous colorway releases. Also, a new ‌iPhone‌ color is a major product, not an accessory.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>A few additional points: retail stores are low on MacBook Airs and iPad Pros; Stores are planning a minor refresh for this week (I think it's a new accessory rather than a new product); Stores are planning a larger refresh early next week (which sounds more product-related). <a href=\"https://t.co/kUkeYjT4rK\">https://t.co/kUkeYjT4rK</a></p>— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1764475865029837212?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 4, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nGurman previously <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/no-apple-event-for-new-ipads-macs-gurman/\">said</a> he believes that Apple is not planning to hold a traditional event to unveil new products, and instead plans to announce them \"on its website\" and with a \"series of online videos and marketing campaigns\" at some point in March or April.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/gurman-apple-new-accessories-this-week/\">Gurman: Apple May Limit Announcements to New Accessories This Week</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-apple-may-limit-announcements-to-new-accessories-this-week.2420989/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"62c09719610328c60f3608488c932f6dd2570b4b06c3f11999f1aae6093489e5","category":"Apple"}
