He expects \nthose features to launch by the end of 2024, he told X employees \nduring an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/e/23698094\">all-hands call on Thursday</a>, saying that people \nwill be surprised with “just how powerful it is.” </p>\n\n<p>“When I say payments, I actually mean someone’s entire financial \nlife,” Musk said, according to audio of the meeting obtained by \nThe Verge. “If it involves money. It’ll be on our platform. \nMoney or securities or whatever. So, it’s not just like send $20 \nto my friend. I’m talking about, like, you won’t need a bank \naccount.” </p>\n\n<p>X CEO Linda Yaccarino said the company sees this becoming a “full \nopportunity” in 2024. “It would blow my mind if we don’t have that \nrolled out by the end of next year,” Musk said. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not a day goes by that I don’t hear from someone who wishes that the entirety of their personal finances were handled by a company with the reputation for reliability of X.</p>\n\n<p>It’s so obvious, and banking systems are so easy, I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if X launches this by April 20, even.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/musk-x-banking\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"019d2281ab5b28d3a9b56126bab5cb18e324b2dcf46b25a4f5a0a082aec72949","category":"Tech"}
