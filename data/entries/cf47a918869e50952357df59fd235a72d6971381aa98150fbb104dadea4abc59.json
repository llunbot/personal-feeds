The company has also removed existing FineWoven <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> cases for older devices from its website, though FineWoven versions of the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MA7A4ZM/A/iphone-finewoven-wallet-with-magsafe-blackberry\">MagSafe Wallet</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MA7J4ZM/A/airtag-finewoven-key-ring-dark-green\">AirTag Key Ring</a> continue to be available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iPhone-15-Pro-FineWoven-feature.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nFineWoven has been heavily criticized for its poor performance in comparison to the former leather cases that Apple used to offer.
