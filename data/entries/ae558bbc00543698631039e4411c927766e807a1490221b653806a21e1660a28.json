It’s not itchy. And it is tough material that is built to be used, a lot. NuYarn Merino is a patented 78% Merino Wool + 22% Nylon blend. It dries 5x faster, is 8.8x more abrasion resistant, and has 85% more elasticity than your typical wool. Plus, it claims a 50% greater tensile strength than standard Merino.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-smile.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"854\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-smile.webp\" alt=\"Ornot NuYarn Merino Riding Shirt smile\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-smile.webp 854w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-smile-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-smile-80x120.webp 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-smile-768x1151.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-side-by-side.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"854\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-side-by-side.webp\" alt=\"Ornot NuYarn Merino Riding Shirt side by side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-side-by-side.webp 854w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-side-by-side-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-side-by-side-80x120.webp 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-side-by-side-768x1151.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Already, Merino is nature’s original performance fiber. The ability to wick sweat, regulate temperature, and resist odor is why Merino featured in cycling clothing for many, many decades. And yes, you can totally wear it multiple days in a row between washings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing though… do <em><strong>NOT</strong></em> put it in the dryer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>OrNot NuYarn Riding Tee – Pricing &amp; Tech Features</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-right-facing.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-right-facing.webp\" alt=\"Ornot NuYarn Merino Riding Shirt right facing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-right-facing.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-right-facing-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-right-facing-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-right-facing-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new OrNot NuYarn Merino Riding Tee sells for $84. While that’s pricey for a t-shirt, it doesn’t feel too bad for a natural fiber, technical cycling top. It comes in 5 sizes each in men’s and women’s cuts (XS-XXL). And Ornot offers it in solid Emerald green, Charcoal gray, or dark blue with white stripes Indigo Line.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Quick-drying, wicking, and extremely breathable</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Patented NuYarn Merino wool</li>\n\n\n\n<li>78% Merino Wool, 22% Nylon</li>\n\n\n\n<li>100% RWS-certified Merino</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Non-itchy 19-micron fine merino wool</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fabric weight: 145gsm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bike-specific tailoring</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rear pocket for sunglasses or other small items</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-in-the-dirt.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-in-the-dirt.webp\" alt=\"Ornot NuYarn Merino Riding Shirt in the dirt\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-in-the-dirt.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-in-the-dirt-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-in-the-dirt-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-in-the-dirt-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-in-the-dirt-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ornot-NuYarn-Merino-Riding-Shirt-in-the-dirt-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.ornotbike.com/\" target=\"_blank\">OrNotBike.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ornot-nuyarn-merino-riding-tee/\">A Nu Way to Wool With OrNot’s NuYarn Merino Riding Tee</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ae558bbc00543698631039e4411c927766e807a1490221b653806a21e1660a28","category":"Cycling"}
