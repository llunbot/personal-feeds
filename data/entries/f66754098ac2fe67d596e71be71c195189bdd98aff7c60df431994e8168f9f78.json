Originally, Apple wanted the glasses to connect to the ‌iPhone‌, but the ‌iPhone‌ didn't have the power or battery life to support them. Apple then transitioned to using the Mac as a power source, but Apple executives weren't convinced a Mac-connected device was a good solution, leading to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/31/apple-cancels-mac-connected-ar-glasses/\">shutdown of the project</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman has previously reported that Apple is conducting user studies at its offices to gauge the appeal of features and interfaces, and that the company is working on a version of visionOS that will run on glasses. Codenamed \"Atlas,\" the studies are being led by Apple's Product Systems Quality team, part of the hardware engineering division.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's rationale seems to be that creating smart glasses could provide a stepping stone to developing true AR glasses, aka Apple Glass. There have been rumors about Apple's work on AR glasses for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/11/14/apple-ar-smart-glasses-in-development/\">almost 10 years now</a>, and the Vision Pro headset is what Apple built because the technology doesn't yet exist for the kind of augmented reality glasses that Apple is aiming for.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeanwhile, Apple is still \"actively developing\" a product that would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/09/apple-still-exploring-airpods-with-cameras/\">combine AirPods with cameras</a>, according to Gurman. The cameras would help power AI features by gathering information on the surrounding environment, similar to the Visual Intelligence feature on supporting iPhone models.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-glasses/\">Apple Glasses</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/apple-still-exploring-smart-glasses-meta-ray-bans/\">Apple Still Exploring Smart Glasses Similar to Meta's Ray-Bans</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-still-exploring-smart-glasses-similar-to-metas-ray-bans.2452699/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f66754098ac2fe67d596e71be71c195189bdd98aff7c60df431994e8168f9f78","category":"Apple"}
