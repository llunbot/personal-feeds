In order to land O'Connor, the Musk-owned X Corp. sued in the Wichita Falls division of the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas.</p>\n<p>O'Connor purchased Tesla stock, a fact that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/no-judge-with-tesla-stock-should-handle-elon-musk-cases-watchdog-argues/\">generated controversy</a> in a different X lawsuit that he is still overseeing. He also invested in Unilever, one of the defendants in X's advertising lawsuit. The Unilever investment appears to be what drove O'Connor's recusal decision.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043030#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043030&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fdacc8b2170005248ede37deb2d853264328f917df757ce65a247a9ecc1c1d83","category":"Tech"}
