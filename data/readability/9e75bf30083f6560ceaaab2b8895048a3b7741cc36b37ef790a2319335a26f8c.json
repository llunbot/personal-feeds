{"title":"1,026 km: Austrian ultra-cyclist sets new 24-hour world record","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/1026-km-austrian-ultra-cyclist-sets-new-24-hour-world-record/","date":1626681681000,"content":"<div><div><p>Austrian ultra-cyclist <a href=\"https://www.christophstrasser.at/\">Christoph Strasser</a> has set a new 24-hour world record on the road (pending verification), travelling a staggering 1,026.215 kilometres.</p><p>That equates to an (equally staggering) average speed of 42.75 km/h over the daylong ride.</p><p>In the process, Strasser blew the previous mark – 915.39 km, set by Ralph Diseviscourt in 2020 – out of the water by more than 100 kilometres.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>The new record, which was set from 16–17 July at Hinterstoisser Air Base in Zeltweg, Austria, is also the first time the 1,000 km mark has been broken.</p><p>“I’m so happy and grateful that I made it despite the weather,” said Strasser. “I’ve been doing this sport for 20 years, and today the nutritional concept was the key to success. I’ve always dreamed of this magical limit, and now this dream has come true.”</p><p>The 38-year-old Strasser is no stranger to phenomenal feats on two wheels. He is the current track world record holder, riding 941.872 km in 2017. He has also won Race Across America (RAAM) on six occasions, breaking the eight day mark in 2013 – the fastest crossing of the USA by an individual.</p><p>According to Strasser’s team, in his latest effort, he broke twelve records over the ride: fastest 100, 200, 300, 500 and 1,000 kilometres; fastest 100, 200, 300 and 500 miles; and fastest six, twelve and 24 hour rides. These are still pending confirmation by the Ultracycling World Assocation.</p><p>Strasser’s ride, conducted in heavy rain at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeltweg_Air_Base\">former Zeltweg Formula 1 circuit</a>, included just two minutes of down-time over the 24 hours. Strasser changed clothes twice, and suffered one puncture, burning 14,400 calories and with an average pulse throughout the attempt of 136 bpm. His normalised power was 275 watts.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>“I think I will forego cycling today,” quipped Strasser after completing the effort.</p><p>The last concerted attempt on the 24 hour record mark was by Australian TransAm and Indian Pacific Wheel Race winner <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/a-24-hour-world-record-attempt-falters-but-is-still-a-win/\">Abdullah Zeinab</a>. In that instance, Zeinab fell victim to an upset stomach, pulling out after 18 hours having travelled just over 600 km, raising more than AU$30,000 for charity in the process.</p></div></div>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"9e75bf30083f6560ceaaab2b8895048a3b7741cc36b37ef790a2319335a26f8c","category":"Cycling"}
