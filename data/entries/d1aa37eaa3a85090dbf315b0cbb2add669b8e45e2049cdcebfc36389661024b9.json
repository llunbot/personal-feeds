Infrared sensors on the military's older-generation missile tracking satellites are tuned to pick out bright thermal signatures from missile exhaust.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003520#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003520&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d1aa37eaa3a85090dbf315b0cbb2add669b8e45e2049cdcebfc36389661024b9","category":"Tech"}
