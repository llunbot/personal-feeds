A 10% baseline tariff on all\nimports into the United States kicked in on Saturday. On April 9,\nthe tariffs that Trump has falsely labeled as “reciprocal” will\nkick in. This will raise the tariff rate on imports from China to\n54% and imports from India to 27%.</p>\n\n<p>By stockpiling as much inventory as possible in the United States,\nApple can delay the impact of the tariffs. It’s unclear just how\nmuch inventory Apple has on hand in the US right now, but if\nthere’s one thing I know, it’s to never doubt Tim Cook’s supply\nchain prowess.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/08/plane-of-iphones-from-india-and-china\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"dab2913fa6c2d42fcaf652cb2002de0032f10b68663229d9b13cbb209cd2430d","category":"Tech"}
