It’s a setup you can still buy and the only option in lower-spec <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/mountain-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">Shimano groupsets</a>, but it’s a bit heavy, a bit messy and takes up handlebar real estate.</span></p>\n<p>There’s also added adjustment built into the I-Spec system that enables you to alter the angle of the shifter lever relative to the brake lever, so you can set up the two to suit your preferred ergonomics.</p>\n<p>Confusingly, I-Spec has now gone through four different versions, not all of which are compatible. First, there was I-Spec A, introduced in 2011 and now obsolete. That was followed by I-Spec B, which still lives on in some product ranges.</p>\n<p>Not wanting to rest on its laurels, Shimano followed this up with I-Spec II, which added more adjustability and made for easier installation.</p>\n<p>The latest and greatest iteration is I-Spec EV. Again, it ups the adjustment range, and also increases rigidity and available braking force.</p>\n<p>As well as MTB components, you can find some versions of I-Spec as an option in Shimano’s other flat-bar groupsets, such as Cues and Alfine.</p>\n<h2>I-Spec A and I-Spec B</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"I-Spec A and I-Spec B\" title=\"I-Spec A and I-Spec B\" />\n\n</div>\n<p>I-Spec A and the newer I-Spec B were Shimano’s first attempt at integrating the shift lever and brake lever on one handlebar clamp. A hole in the brake lever clamp assembly enables you to bolt the compatible shift lever to the back of the brake lever.</p>\n<p>In type A, there was a simple nut and bolt, and the shifter mounted onto a small hook on the brake lever clamp. In type B, there’s a small lateral pin that passes through the two sides of the brake lever clamp and supports the bolt for the shifter. There’s also a bit available that enables you to mount a type B shifter on a type A brake lever.</p>\n<p>Here’s a table of groupsets with an I-Spec B option:</p>\n<div>\n                <table>\n                <colgroup>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                    </colgroup>\n        <thead>\n<tr>\n                                        <th>﻿Series</th><th>Model</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n\n        <tr>\n            <td>XTR</td><td>M980</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td>Deore XT</td><td>M8000/M780/T780</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td>SLX</td><td>M7000/M670</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td>Deore</td><td>M610/T610</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td>Saint</td><td>M820</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td>Deore LX</td><td>T670</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td>Alfine</td><td>S7000/S700</td>        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n                    \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                \n    \n    \n</div>\n\n<h2>I-Spec II</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Shimano I-Spec II clamp\" title=\"Shimano I-Spec II clamp\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> I-Spec II components allow for 12mm of left/right movement and 15 degrees of forwards/backwards tilt.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Shimano</i></span></div>\n<p>Whereas I-Spec A and B used a bolt assembly on the brake lever to mount the shifter, I-Spec II uses a semi-circular spacer inside the brake lever clamp.</p>\n<p>There’s a greater angle of rotation between the two assemblies (15 degrees) and you can also move the shift lever position in and out by 12mm relative to the brake lever, to optimise the ergonomics of your controls.

However, the angle adjustment range varies from 10 degrees for Deore M600 and M4100 up to 60 degrees for XTR M9100/M9120. In the middle are Deore XT M8100 and SLX M7100, with 20 degrees of adjustment.</p>\n<p>All these levers enable you to move the shift lever in and out relative to the brake lever by 14mm, an increase of 2mm over I-Spec II.</p>\n<p>As well as the extra adjustability, the positioning of the brake cylinder means its outer edge under the lever makes contact with the handlebar. Shimano says this gives a second bracing point, so there’s greater rigidity and more leverage for more effective braking.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"2023 Marin Rift Zone 29 XR mountain bike\" title=\"2023 Marin Rift Zone 29 XR mountain bike-7\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Shimano’s mechanical seatpost dropper lever works with a wide array of dropper posts.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Marin Bikes</i></span></div>\n<p>There’s a mechanical seatpost dropper lever that’s compatible with I-Spec EV too.
