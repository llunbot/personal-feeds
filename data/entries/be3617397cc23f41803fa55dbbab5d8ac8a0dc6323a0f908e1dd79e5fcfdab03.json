The summaries will be dynamically updated as new reviews are posted to ensure feedback remains current, similar to the feature Amazon recently adopted to summarize reams of customer reviews on its product listings. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to Apple, apps will need to reach a certain threshold of reviews before becoming eligible for the feature, which will initially launch in select regions. Meanwhile, in an effort to maintain accuracy, developers will have the ability to report summaries they believe misrepresent their apps. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe feature appears to be part of Apple's broader push into AI-powered features, following the recent introduction of text and notification summarization capabilities in iOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.1. Apple hasn't announced when review summaries will go live, but their presence in the App Store API suggests a launch may be imminent.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-summaries-user-reviews-app-store/\">Apple to Start Providing Summaries of User Reviews in App Store</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-start-providing-summaries-of-user-reviews-in-app-store.2441417/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"be3617397cc23f41803fa55dbbab5d8ac8a0dc6323a0f908e1dd79e5fcfdab03","category":"Apple"}
