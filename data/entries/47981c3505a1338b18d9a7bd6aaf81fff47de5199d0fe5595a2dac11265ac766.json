Apple's personal assistant is equipped with a long list of costume suggestions that are updated on a yearly basis.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/siri-halloween-costume-suggestions.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n‌Siri‌'s suggestions often involve puns, some of which are clever and some of which are downright silly. Some of ‌Siri‌'s costume ideas:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li>Dress up like a cat, put on an eyepatch, and be Nick Furry.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>If you wear a white sheet and draw tattoos all over your face, you'd be Ghost Malone.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>You could be a disembodied voice. Oh no wait. That's kind of my thing.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Dress in yellow and white, then put on some little red horns, and be a deviled egg.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Jump up and down, over and over, and shake your fist. You can tell people you're antigravity.</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nAsking ‌Siri‌ for a Halloween costume idea is a feature that's been around for almost a decade now, but it's easy to forget the option exists, and there are also typically new costume suggestions to see each year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to suggesting Halloween costumes, ‌Siri‌ can also read a selection of Halloween poems to you.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/siri-halloween-poem.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n‌Siri‌ can give costume suggestions on iOS 17, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, and earlier versions of iOS, as well as macOS and Apple Watch.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/siri-halloween-costume-ideas-2024/\">Need a Halloween Costume Idea?
