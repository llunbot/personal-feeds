For the M4 MacBook Pro, there’s one more feature that Apple hasn’t mentioned at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1857208745014776215\">display expert Ross Young</a>, Apple now uses a quantum dot film in the MacBook Pro’s Liquid Retina XDR display. This QD film replaces a KSF phosphor film (also known as a narrow-band red phosphor) placed between the backlight and the display. The result is that the MacBook Pro’s display creates a more consistent color gamut and “better motion performance.” There are also environmental benefits as Young points out:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Big Apple display news, they have adopted quantum dots for the first time. The latest MacBook Pro’s (M4) use a quantum dot (QD) film rather than a red KSF phosphor film.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, Apple went with the KSF solution due to better efficiency and lack of cadmium (Cd), but the latest Cd-free QD films are very efficient, feature as good or better color gamut and better motion performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/macbook-pro-color-gamut.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"MacBook Pro color gamut\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><a href=\"https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1857208745014776215\" target=\"_blank\">Ross Young</a></div>\n<cite><a href=\"https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1857208745014776215\">Ross Young (@DSCCRoss) via X, November 14, 2024</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>QD films are often used on high-end TVs and displays. So why the switch now? Apple hasn’t talked about this so it’s mere speculation, but based on Young’s post, it appears that Apple wasn’t satisfied with QD film’s previous performance. Why didn’t Apple mention this change? Most likely because it’s the kind of under-the-hood change that won’t factor much into a buying decision. But it’s a notable change that shows how Apple continues to improve its high-end devices without raising costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’ll be interesting to see if Apple adopts QD film for the M4 MacBook Air, which uses an LED display, instead of the mini-LED display in the MacBook Pro. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">Reports</a> say that the new Air will be revealed in the spring of 2025 and it’s expected to be nothing more than a chip upgrade. </p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"09eb1f0b93da8770d03133bc728d62ad4a06523b3cb61121b04a6dba06e8cc40","category":"Apple"}
