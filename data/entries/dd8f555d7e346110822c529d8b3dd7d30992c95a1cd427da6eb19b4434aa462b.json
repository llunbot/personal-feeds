Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence team said that Storm-0558, a China-based hacking outfit that conducts espionage on behalf of that country’s government, exploited them starting on May 15. Microsoft drove out the attackers on June 16 after a customer tipped off company researchers of the intrusion.</p>\n<h2>Above all else: Avoid the Z-word</h2>\n<p>In standard parlance among security professionals, this means that Storm-0558 exploited zero-days in the Microsoft cloud services. A “zero-day” is a vulnerability that is known to or exploited by outsiders before the vendor has a patch for it. “Exploit” means using code or other means to trigger a vulnerability in a way that causes harm to the vendor or others.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954171#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954171&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"dd8f555d7e346110822c529d8b3dd7d30992c95a1cd427da6eb19b4434aa462b","category":"Tech"}
