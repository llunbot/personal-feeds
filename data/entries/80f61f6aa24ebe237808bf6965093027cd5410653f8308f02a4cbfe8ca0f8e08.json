This warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship, providing long-term confidence in every ride.</p>\n<p>To qualify, bikes must be registered within 30 days of purchase or by April 1, 2025, whichever comes later. Bikes purchased and registered in 2024 are automatically enrolled for lifetime coverage. Bikes that are not registered will retain a 3-year frame warranty, but registration unlocks the full benefits of lifetime protection.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Pivot_Bearing_Replacement.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Pivot_Bearing_Replacement.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Pivot_Bearing_Replacement.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Pivot_Bearing_Replacement.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Courtesy Bearing Replacement Program</h3>\n<p>As part of our dedication to durability and performance, Pivot Cycles is excited to offer lifetime replacement for frame linkage bearings. While Pivot’s precision-engineered bearings are designed to last, this program ensures riders are covered in the rare instance a replacement is needed.</p>\n<p>The Courtesy Bearing Replacement Program IS NOT a warranty. Customers are responsible for labor costs associated with bearing replacement; however, resources and guides for DIY replacement are available in the Pivot Pro Garage.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/pivot-cycles-lifetime-warranty-bearing-replacement-program/\">Pivot Cycles Premier Lifetime Warranty and Bearing Replacement Program</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"80f61f6aa24ebe237808bf6965093027cd5410653f8308f02a4cbfe8ca0f8e08","category":"Cycling"}
