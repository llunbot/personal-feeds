Recently, they announced a new torque wrench kit for at-home and trail use. I’ve had it kicking around in <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/every-ride-carry-for-mtb-and-gravel/\" target=\"_blank\">my riding kit</a> for a few weeks now.</p>\n<p>At 185 grams (on my USPS scale), it’s hardly noticeable but has been quite handy, particularly when it comes to adjusting the fit of a new bike or making slight adjustments during a ride.</p>\n<p>The RocknRoll TQ is built on a small ratchet system. Simply slide the ratchet direction switch to loosen or tighten. For tightening,  with the dedicated torque function, thread the bolt in until you feel resistance and then grab the torque handle, apply pressure and dial it in from 2 Nm to 10 Nm.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Designs-RocknRoll-TQ-3.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Designs-RocknRoll-TQ-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Designs-RocknRoll-TQ-3.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Designs-RocknRoll-TQ-3.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Designs-RocknRoll-TQ-3.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Within the kit is a 2 to 8 mm hex, along with T20, T25, and PH2 bits. An extension rod is included to reach hard-to-get-to spots. If you don’t ride with a dedicated tool wallet, you can use the Granite Design waller to hold your extra quick links, valve core tools, or even an Apple AirTag if you lose things easily!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Designs-RocknRoll-TQ-4.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Designs-RocknRoll-TQ-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Designs-RocknRoll-TQ-4.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Designs-RocknRoll-TQ-4.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Designs-RocknRoll-TQ-4.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Paul Component specs 5 nm for the steerer and 4 nm for the Boxcar faceplate.</em></p>\n<p>My only critique is that without proper torque indexing, you can never be 100% sure you applied the correct amount. However, I did double-check the torque with my indexed, more heavy-duty at-home torque wrench and the RocknRoll TQ was always dead on.</p>\n<p>I spoke to Travis from <a href=\"https://www.paulcomp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Component Engineering</a>, and the main issue with any sort of <a href=\"https://www.paulcomp.com/product-category/components/boxcars/\" target=\"_blank\">Boxcar</a> warranty comes from people over-tightening the faceplate and steerer bolts. In general, you should be careful and follow your component manufactuere’s torque spec, always! Doing so ensures the long life of your components.</p>\n<p>File this tool under “so simple and so necessary”…</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://granite-design.com/products/rocknroll-tq\" target=\"_blank\">Granite Design</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/granite-design-rocknroll-tq-review/\">Torque Palm Power: Granite Design RocknRoll TQ Review</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"ea0d9b9766841107842d05644df5aa8ca1eb07412532208c49fbad7239066ef1","category":"Cycling"}
