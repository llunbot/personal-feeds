Literally, since their new computer appears to be called the ELEMNT ACE. That news was first leaked on reddit when <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wahoofitness/comments/1g4cicb/new_bike_computer_about_to_be_released/\" target=\"_blank\">redditor ‘utzachaka’</a> posted the <a href=\"https://fcc.report/FCC-ID/PADWF149/\">FCC report </a>from the latest Wahoo computer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ever wondered what goes into an FCC report filing… it’s a lot. And it seems to only get more complicated as more features are crammed into these compact devices. The report seems to confirm that the device will be called the ELEMNT ACE, and it also gives us an idea of the size of its battery. Listed as a whopping 4350mAh, that’s more than double the 2000mAh of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wahoo-updates-elemnt-roam-gps-with-32gb-memory-better-navigation-and-much-more/\">Wahoo ROAM</a>. Even compared to the Karoo 3 with a 3200mAh battery, the ACE seems like it will be packed with juice. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wahoo-Elemnt-ACE-spy-photo-Reddit-1-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1997\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wahoo-Elemnt-ACE-spy-photo-Reddit-1-1536x1997.webp\" alt=\"Wahoo Elemnt ACE spy photo Reddit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wahoo-Elemnt-ACE-spy-photo-Reddit-1-1536x1997.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wahoo-Elemnt-ACE-spy-photo-Reddit-1-231x300.webp 231w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wahoo-Elemnt-ACE-spy-photo-Reddit-1-92x120.webp 92w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wahoo-Elemnt-ACE-spy-photo-Reddit-1-768x998.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wahoo-Elemnt-ACE-spy-photo-Reddit-1-1181x1536.webp 1181w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wahoo-Elemnt-ACE-spy-photo-Reddit-1-1575x2048.webp 1575w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wahoo-Elemnt-ACE-spy-photo-Reddit-1-jpg.webp 1923w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wahoo-Elemnt-ACE-spy-photo-Reddit-2-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"2110\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wahoo-Elemnt-ACE-spy-photo-Reddit-2-1536x2110.webp\" alt=\"Wahoo Elemnt ACE spy photo Reddit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wahoo-Elemnt-ACE-spy-photo-Reddit-2-1536x2110.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wahoo-Elemnt-ACE-spy-photo-Reddit-2-218x300.webp 218w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wahoo-Elemnt-ACE-spy-photo-Reddit-2-87x120.webp 87w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wahoo-Elemnt-ACE-spy-photo-Reddit-2-768x1055.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wahoo-Elemnt-ACE-spy-photo-Reddit-2-1118x1536.webp 1118w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wahoo-Elemnt-ACE-spy-photo-Reddit-2-1491x2048.webp 1491w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wahoo-Elemnt-ACE-spy-photo-Reddit-2-jpg.webp 1820w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>(Photo/reddit: anotherwahooligan)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It will probably need that juice as it seems that the computer will make the leap to a touchscreen. That info comes courtesy of the post made by <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wahoofitness/comments/1g8h9oz/just_order_on_ebay_international_i_bought_3_enjoy/#lightbox\" target=\"_blank\">redditor ‘anotherwahooligan’</a> who posted pictures of what appears to be the ACE box. On the box, you can just make out the words for the features including color touchscreen, a 3.8″ (?) screen, dual-band GPS, 64GB memory, USB-C charging and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the sensor category, it’s hard to make out, but the first one looks like it might be ‘Wind’? Are we about to see a computer with its own aerodynamics coaching built in? We can’t wait to find out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/reddit-leak-new-wahoo-ace-computer-touchscreen/\">reddit Leak Hints New Wahoo Ace Computer w/ Touchscreen &amp; Massive Battery</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1316e366c9f958e4246ea554afb6ddf61bb49481c7b8961885d9e1f858faa745","category":"Cycling"}
