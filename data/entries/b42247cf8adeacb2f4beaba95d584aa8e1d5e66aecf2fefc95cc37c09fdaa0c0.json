You could be forgiven if not, as the program continues to be tossed around by NASA planners, and it is still not entirely clear what purpose the lunar space station is supposed to serve.</p>\n<p>The Gateway—a small space station that will fly in a halo orbit around the Moon and spend most of its time far from the lunar surface—was initially supposed to launch in 2022. <span>That obviously did not happen, and now, according to <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-106878\" target=\"_blank\">a new report from the US Government Accountability Office</a>, the space agency does not expect the launch of the initial elements of the Gateway until at least December 2027.</span> The baseline cost estimate is $5.3 billion.</p>\n<p>NASA's present plans contemplate using the Gateway as part of the Artemis IV mission, presently scheduled for September 2028. Unfortunately, the Gateway's current launch target is already three months later than needed to support Artemis IV, the second mission to land humans on the Moon. But that's OK. There are a lot of other moving parts for this mission, so a launch any time this decade would be a win.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040396#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040396&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b42247cf8adeacb2f4beaba95d584aa8e1d5e66aecf2fefc95cc37c09fdaa0c0","category":"Tech"}
