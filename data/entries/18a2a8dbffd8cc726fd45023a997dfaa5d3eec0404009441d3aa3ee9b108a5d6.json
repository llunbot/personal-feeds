The ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max have now been discontinued by Apple, and as slightly older models, lower prices can be found for the device at third-party resellers. As such, some customers who own an older device may be weighing up whether to upgrade to an ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ or an ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ share a large number of features, should you consider buying or sticking with the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ to save money? Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models is best for you, and serves as a way to clearly see the all of the differences that the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ brings to the table.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlthough the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ share most of their basic features, the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ offers a large number of notable upgrades over its predecessor, such as a titanium design, Action button, USB-C port, and A17 Bionic chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>‌iPhone 14

like the USB-C port and Action button that change the methods of interaction with the device. The new, considerably more lightweight titanium design, slimmer borders around the display, and contoured edges result in a noticeably different aesthetic and feel in the hand.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ also brings advancements to photography and videography, adding support for 24-megapixel high-resolution photos, Smart HDR 5, and next-generation portraits – practical features that most users can take advantage of. The ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max takes things to the next level with its tetraprism telephoto camera, offering up to 5x optical zoom on the ‌iPhone‌ for the first time. Features like 48-megapixel HEIF capture, external and log recording, Academy Color Encoding System, and fast data transfer via USB 3 are also major upgrades for professionals.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis is not to mention Roadside Assistance via satellite, new color options, the second-generation ultra wideband chip, and the A17 Pro chip – Apple's first chip made with a ‌3nm‌ fabrication process, which radically improves the gaming capabilities of the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDue to the scale and breadth of these improvements, some ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ users can justify upgrading to the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌, especially if they value the new design, USB-C port, Action button, and camera improvements. It is worth sticking with the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ if you are holding off for an even more substantial upgrade in the future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCustomers coming from an older model also have good reason to preference the latest model over the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ due to the relatively large number of improvements and additional features offered by the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌, but it depends on just how inexpensively last year's Pro models can now be obtained.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/\">iPhone 14 Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-14-Pro\">iPhone 14 Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-14-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 14 Pro vs. iPhone 15 Pro Buyer's Guide: 30+ Upgrades Compared</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-14-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro-buyers-guide-30-upgrades-compared.2401473/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"18a2a8dbffd8cc726fd45023a997dfaa5d3eec0404009441d3aa3ee9b108a5d6","category":"Apple"}
