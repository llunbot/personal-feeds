Identified at this meeting of the meat heads as a key to a successful show, was to never—under any circumstances—allow me to enter a bike show. From that point onwards, all security guards at all bike shows all over the world were issued with a postcard, with a picture of my face, accompanied by strict instructions not to let me in, however many legitimate tickets and passes I present. The first time was at BESPOKED in 2017, when a swollen gammon of a man with a sore-looking face, glistening with greasy sweat, locked me out halfway through the show set up for not having my exhibitors pass, which was due to be collected inside the show.</p>\n<p>Even having collected the pass, the same guard refused me entry every time I exited and re-entered the show for the whole weekend, and so the game began. I’d set him up with an accomplice who’d distract him with questions, or little strips of bacon attached to a length of fishing wire, then I’d sneak up as close to the door as possible until he saw me, and then run into the show, amalgamating myself with the crowd until he gave up the chase. Since then getting into bike shows has been problematic, and this year’s Eurobike was no different.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1460\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-7.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-7.jpg?resize=1024,748&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-7.jpg?resize=768,561&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-7.jpg?resize=1800,1314&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-7.jpg?resize=1335,975&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-7.jpg?resize=700,511&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-7.jpg?resize=1536,1121&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I had a press pass to collect from the press room, which was a good 20-minute walk from the main entrance, however, I wasn’t allowed to go in and collect it because I had a Brompton with me.</p>\n<p><em>It’s okay! It’s a Brompton, I can just fold it up.</em></p>\n<p>I pleaded with a man who repeated the mantra that he’d learned at the great bike show security guards meeting of 2017.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry sir, I can’t let you in. It’s not allowed”</p>\n<p><em>Okay… what if I fold it into a case so you can’t see that it’s a bike?</em></p>\n<p>“I’m sorry sir, I can’t let you in.

So I unfolded my Brompton, rammed in a pair of AirPods, and began my warm-up lap of the show’s perimeter. I rode around to the service entrance where vans go in to load and unload. I knew where it was because I’d used it as a photo spot for the previous year’s show, and I also knew there were short, moveable barriers with a little gap for bicycles on the end. I’d hoped that the guards would just be in their little hut eating donuts and watching cat videos on their phones, but to my chagrin, they were out actually guarding the entrance.</p>\n<p>I rode at them as fast as I could on the pavement, spinning out, doing my best aero tuck behind my Brompton’s front basket, brimming with camera gear. I couldn’t believe they were actually willing to put themselves in harm’s way to stop me from entering a bike show! In the last seconds, I faked a left further onto the pavement, they followed my queue before I swerved a hard right, half hopping, half falling down the curb, and squeezing past the other side of the barrier.</p>\n<p>I kept my pace into the test track where I couldn’t have been more at odds with all the funny little electric cars slowly and carefully negotiating the hairpins. I slowed down and let the adrenaline settle before locking my bike to a bin by the Amerikan hotdog stand and entering the air-conditioned glass monstrosity that is Messe-Friedrichshafen.</p>\n<p>I was in.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-33.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-33.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-33.jpg?resize=1024,768&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-33.jpg?resize=768,576&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-33.jpg?resize=1800,1350&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-33.jpg?resize=1335,1001&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-33.jpg?resize=700,525&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-33.jpg?resize=1536,1152&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>The partitioning of the show is almost uncanny in how it reflects brands’ statuses in cycling culture and their reasons for exhibiting. </em></p>\n<p>On the first day, I covered hall 12 (the hall where most well-known brands live) which orbits a massive SRAM booth in the center. Hall 11 is a little weirder; half of the ground floor is an expanse of Shimano, and another third is a sea of low-grade to middling bikes, cheaply made in factories under the brand Bulls. The floor above is home to high-grade parts and accessories. Hall 9 is perhaps the least visitor friendly, with China and Taiwan each taking up huge spaces, divided into a number of tiny booths for factories to exhibit on.</p>\n<p>The ceilings are lower in hall 9 to squeeze 3 floors into the footprint of 2 and it feels more like a marketplace for offshoring rather than an exhibition. It’s also the only place in the cycling industry I’ve seen women employed to dress up as “sexy nurses” and hand out test tube shots which feels like an extremely dated “marketing” tactic. Hall 8 is perhaps my favorite: it only has one floor and includes the “startups area” as well as a number of ambiguous categories centering around future mobility, so it’s kind of the area where anything could happen, which makes it the most fun.</p>\n<p>I ditched my bags with the lovely, friendly Schwalbe, whose booth had been assembled from entirely reusable materials, giving a nod to their global re-brand centered around circular economies and recycling tires. How to implement genuine sustainability practices into infrastructure and supply chains was a big theme at this year’s show; I was excited that it felt like brands were doing the hard work to put complex new systems in place and genuinely reduce the industry’s environmental impact rather than hollow greenwashing that has become so ubiquitous.</p>\n<p>The first booth I photographed was Gates, who had almost too much great stuff on display. Everything was well chosen to show the scope of benefits the carbon belt drive offers. Everyone in the Gates booth seemed to be named Martin, so I knew it was Martin who had been responsible for both last year’s awesome selection and this year’s selection of bikes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1432\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-123.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-123.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-123.jpg?resize=1024,733&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-123.jpg?resize=768,550&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-123.jpg?resize=1800,1289&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-123.jpg?resize=1335,956&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-123.jpg?resize=700,501&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-123.jpg?resize=1536,1100&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>The Gates Carbon Drive Lavo Concept Bike</h3>\n<p>There was a concept bike! Not a pre-production prototype or even a show bike but an actual concept bike! A 1:1-sized model bike made from wood and bits and bobs of foam and plastic and a smattering of actual bike parts for realism is used to illustrate a possible future. It was fantastically weird and amazing to see. I thought these kinds of 1:1 models only really happened in the world of cars. It was displayed on a gently rotating platform and cordoned off with a sign saying “Do not touch,” mirroring the exact visual language of a car show which is an appropriate way to address Eurobike.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-126.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-126.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-126.jpg?resize=1024,768&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-126.jpg?resize=768,576&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-126.jpg?resize=1800,1350&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-126.jpg?resize=1335,1001&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-126.jpg?resize=700,525&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-126.jpg?resize=1536,1152&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>By making a concept bike, Gates could display a machine that (while not currently achievable) is a visual representation of their aspirations for future cargo bikes that are unrestricted by the availability or even feasibility of certain parts. Part super sensible construction, part spacey constructivist design, and if I’m cynical part exercise bike, it succeeded in making me genuinely excited about an elevated chainstay, carbon drive electric cargo bike.</p>\n<p>How are those wheels made? I imagine they might be made with continuous carbon fibre filaments that run through the spokes hubs and rims like <em>Lightweight</em> wheels but are even stronger due to the smaller diameter and massively fat spokes. But what about that cylinder in the back? Is that just a battery or is it some kind of hydrogen cylinder? I love the lights built into the tubes and the adjustment that can be made on the front and rear by presumably moving the top part over that thinner black section that separates it from the bottom.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-131.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-131.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-131.jpg?resize=1024,768&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-131.jpg?resize=768,576&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-131.jpg?resize=1800,1350&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-131.jpg?resize=1335,1001&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-131.jpg?resize=700,525&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-131.jpg?resize=1536,1152&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>So spacey and cool! I want (a real, working) one! What would I carry? My kids, wearing those cool 3D printed Pettit Pli space suits to their Mandarin class, in a glass pyramid full of citrus trees at the center of a well-kept municipal park. <em>The mutants never attack during the day, but should a rogue raider surface and evade the authority bots to try and harvest my organs, I can easily outpace them without getting sweaty because it’s hydrogen-powered!</em> While we’re in the future, let’s say it’s self-riding for additional safety, too! Concept vehicles are the best because they represent a utopia.</p>\n<p>That’s where I’d like to live.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1384\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-140.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-140.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-140.jpg?resize=1024,709&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-140.jpg?resize=768,531&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-140.jpg?resize=1800,1246&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-140.jpg?resize=1335,924&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-140.jpg?resize=700,484&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-140.jpg?resize=1536,1063&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><strong>The Very Real Gamux</strong></h3>\n<p>The Martins of Gates also selected this Gamux downhill race bike, which I tried to pry away from the Hays stand the previous year to photograph, to no avail. This year, three of the available four Gamux bikes were on display at different booths, all showing in various degrees of filth. I chose the Gates bike to photograph because Martin offered me some currywurst in the meeting room. What a bike! Lower slung than last year’s bike and anodized black, the frame is constructed from a single CNC milled billet, with truss-filled I-beams replacing tubes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-149.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-149.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-149.jpg?resize=1024,768&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-149.jpg?resize=768,576&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-149.jpg?resize=1800,1350&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-149.jpg?resize=1335,1001&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-149.jpg?resize=700,525&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-149.jpg?resize=1536,1152&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>This year’s bike was also adorned with some black gaffer tape, which I speculate exists to cover secret carbon fiber box sections that fill the I beam to tune flex and twist. It’s a pretty cool construction method that would theoretically allow for a few different scenarios. It could allow riders to fine-tune the flex in the front triangle to suit different courses, or to make the bike handle differently, or perhaps even keep a similar degree of flex for more than one rider. The rear triangle was also machined from a single billet, which was very impressive bearing in mind its thickness.</p>\n<p>The belt bent back on itself over a pulley wheel, which wasn’t advised a few years ago, but following some testing is now very much on the cards and opens up a whole load of design options for use with a belt drive. I also noticed the funny little belt retaining shelf bracket bolted onto the rear axle, which, given the recommended belt tension, shows how hard these bikes are designed to get ridden.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-161.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-161.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-161.jpg?resize=1024,768&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-161.jpg?resize=768,576&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-161.jpg?resize=1800,1350&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-161.jpg?resize=1335,1001&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-161.jpg?resize=700,525&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-161.jpg?resize=1536,1152&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Every bike on the Gates booth was rad in its own way, and I could have just covered Gates for the whole article, but instead, I chose to cover five more marathons’ worth of ground for the next four days to really dig into Eurobike’s weirdness.

At this point, it’s all a big Esher drawing, so who knows?

It was a great question, though, which I borrowed for the rest of the show.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1463\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-212.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-212.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-212.jpg?resize=1024,749&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-212.jpg?resize=768,562&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-212.jpg?resize=1800,1317&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-212.jpg?resize=1335,977&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-212.jpg?resize=700,512&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-212.jpg?resize=1536,1124&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Back at the Brompton booth, I found myself getting excited about the new T-type, especially in the context of an urban mobility show. I travel with a Brompton when I fly because it JUST fits within the hand luggage specified sizes (unless you fly from London City Airport where the scanners have been changed to just not accommodate a Brompton.) It means if the airline decides that you can’t take it abroad as hand luggage for some reason, they usually check it for free. It means that when I travel, I have a bike to get around town, and sure, it’s not as nice to ride as an ordinary bike, but it’s a hell of a lot better than any city-hire bike.</p>\n<p>My Brompton is cobbled together out of bits of broken Bromptons from various bike shops I worked at. It’s been going strong for 15 years, as the bike that I use when I need to duck into London or even when I’m going out and planning to stay out, and I don’t want to leave a bike locked outside all night. Before that, when I lived on a boat in London and didn’t have any space, it was just my bike, and I loved it.</p>\n<p>Sure it rides like a funny little bike with small wheels and not enough front center or trail, but in town, that’s actually pretty fun; the front carrying block and the available luggage for it are super useful and work well. It’s probably the best solution to urban mobility I’ve ever seen, at least in London, because of how seamlessly it integrates into existing systems of public transport and pokey little London flats. It’s far better designed than almost any other weird vehicle at the show under the ambiguous banner of urban mobility.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1420\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-203.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-203.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-203.jpg?resize=1024,727&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-203.jpg?resize=768,545&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-203.jpg?resize=1800,1278&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-203.jpg?resize=1335,948&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-203.jpg?resize=700,497&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-203.jpg?resize=1536,1091&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The T- type is the first major redesign in a while. It’s much lighter, with not only a titanium main frame made in Sheffield but also a new carbon fork, cranks, stem, joints, Twizzlers, shifter, mech, elastomers, foldy wheels, bars, pedals, and pretty much everything. I took it for a little ride around, and beyond being lighter, it also felt more positive and together than my janky sticker-bombed Frankenbrompton. It feels like a genuinely excellent tool for urban mobility. Cites would be better places if every child was given one on their 14th birthday to get around on. That feels more manageable, and more realistic than everyone whizzing around on mismatched, and tricky/expensive-to-maintain lightweight electric vehicles.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1450\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-72.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-72.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-72.jpg?resize=1024,742&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-72.jpg?resize=768,557&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-72.jpg?resize=1800,1305&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-72.jpg?resize=1335,968&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-72.jpg?resize=700,508&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Eurobike-pt.1-72.jpg?resize=1536,1114&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Go Go Gadget Gary!</h3>\n<p>Waiting for flat white number five at the SRAM booth which was the epicenter of Thursday, I bumped into Gary Fisher.</p>\n<p><em>What’s the be….

There’s part of me that really enjoys the obsession with cycling data and the newly democratized science of dialing in, but another part of me that sees that as a separate hobby that can distract, and detract from actual cycling.
