We’re talking about the best-equipped version of the M4 Mac mini, with an M4 processor, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage, which <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0DLBV145M/?th=1\">Amazon is now selling for $860.66</a>, an impressive $139 discount off its $999 MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This itty bitty Mac fits on any desktop, allowing you to declutter your office and be more productive, concentrating easier on what you need to get done. The computer features the fast M4 chip, so you know it can handle any task you need to complete with blazing speed. Even better, this one comes with 24GB of memory, as well as 512GB of storage space, which is more than enough for apps, photos, and whatever work projects you will handle on this device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2512911/m4-pro-mac-mini-review-remarkably-small-and-incredibly-powerful.html\">reviewed the new Mac Mini</a>, we loved its small footprint and excellent performance.
