The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/european-union-announces-plans-to-require-all-mobile-devices-to-use-usb-c/\" target=\"_blank\">European Union even wants to force the use of USB-C</a>. So security keys that serve as a form of multi-factor authentication or passwordless login need to play well with the port. Hardware authentication company Yubico is addressing that need with an inexpensive security key that allows logins via USB-C—or with just a tap of the key to a PC or phone.</p>\n<h2>A cheaper USB-C security key</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.yubico.com/product/security-key-c-nfc-by-yubico/\" target=\"_blank\">Security C NFC</a> costs five dollars more than <a href=\"https://www.yubico.com/product/security-key-nfc-by-yubico/\" target=\"_blank\">the USB-A option</a> ($29 versus $24). That's still cheaper than Google's Titan USB-C/Security Key, which is <a href=\"https://store.google.com/us/config/titan_security_key?hl=en-US\" target=\"_blank\">$35</a>—if you can find it in stock.</p>\n<p>No matter how you connect it to your PC, the Security Key NFC supports the FIDO U2F and FIDO2/WebAuthn authentication standards, which isn't surprising, as Yubico contributes to both. The key lets you log in to many well-known websites and apps, including Gmail, YouTube, Twitter, Dropbox, Office 365, and Xbox Live.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1807565#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1807565&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a2b45ecda7efb47f48eb2f21f4e85134a47c000671bfc4fd44916e7a52dcfc57","category":"Tech"}
