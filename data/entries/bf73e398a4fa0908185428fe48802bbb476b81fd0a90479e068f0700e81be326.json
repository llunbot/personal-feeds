Alongside the start of school are usually new tech product <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/what-to-expect-from-the-iphone-15-and-more-on-september-12/\">announcements</a>. This week, I had my eyes on a new smattering of PC keyboards (as you <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/gears-technica-the-keyboards-and-mice-our-editors-swear-by/\">may have heard</a>, I could use an upgrade). But many keyboard announcements felt like more of the same.</p>\n<p>Take Logitech's keyboard releases this week. On Tuesday, it announced the <a href=\"https://fave.co/3Z8EX1o\" target=\"_blank\">G Pro X TKL</a> wireless (dongle, Bluetooth, or wired) <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/the-ars-technica-guide-to-mechanical-keyboards/\">mechanical keyboard</a>. It's part of Logitech's high-end series of gaming peripherals, but those accessories tend to appeal to non-gaming power users, too. For example, I've had great success using some of Logitech's gaming keyboards for work, including low-profile ones that helped speed up my typing. That's not what you're getting with the new G Pro X TKL.</p>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/new-logitech-magenta-980x551.jpeg\" alt /></div>\n          <p>\n            Logitech's G Pro X TKL in magenta.
