Apple considers a device to be \"vintage\" once five years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. Apple and Apple Authorized Service Providers sometimes offer repairs for vintage devices, but only if parts remain available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNote that if you have an iPhone 6s Plus with 32GB of storage, that particular configuration was already classified as \"obsolete\" prior to today.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has yet to add the smaller iPhone XS and iPhone 6s models to the \"vintage\" list.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, aluminum and stainless steel Apple Watch Series 2 models are now classified as \"obsolete\" worldwide, but the high-end Series 2 model with a ceramic case has yet to be added to the list. Apple considers a device to be \"obsolete\" once seven years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. Once a device is obsolete, it is no longer eligible for repair at Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider, with the only exception being MacBook battery replacements for up to a 10-year period.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/\">Vintage and Obsolete Apple Products</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/15/apple-adds-two-iphone-models-to-vintage-list/\">Apple Adds iPhone XS Max and More to Vintage/Obsolete Product Lists</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-adds-iphone-xs-max-and-more-to-vintage-obsolete-product-lists.2443073/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dcbca4d86c98d7d326814d65b93a58943facbb06870075574a41535068cd9711","category":"Apple"}
