Actual prices for the headset at retail have fallen since then, though; Best Buy offered new units <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20231028115543/https://www.bestbuy.com/site/meta-quest-2-advanced-all-in-one-virtual-reality-headset-128gb-gray/6473553.p?skuId=6473553\">for $299 as of last October</a> and <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20231124064121/https://www.bestbuy.com/site/meta-quest-2-advanced-all-in-one-virtual-reality-headset-128gb-gray/6473553.p?skuId=6473553\">for $250 by the 2023 post-Thanksgiving shopping season</a>, for instance.</p>\n<p>And the Quest 2 is far from the company's state-of-the-art headset at this point. Meta launched <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/metas-absurdly-expensive-quest-pro-is-now-slightly-less-absurdly-expensive/\">the surprisingly expensive Quest Pro</a> in late 2022 before dropping that headset's price from $1,499 to $999 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/metas-absurdly-expensive-quest-pro-is-now-slightly-less-absurdly-expensive/\">less than five months later</a>. And last year's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-version-0-5/\">launch of the Quest 3</a> at a $499 starting price brought some significant improvements in resolution, processing power, thickness, and full-color passthrough images over the Quest 2.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018413#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018413&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"78a417dfaa89863de7c86da3155e1c7a99c0dfb717e4712bb121a7bfe959e4ef","category":"Tech"}
