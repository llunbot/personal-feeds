It also features bonded sections of a waterproof rubber-like polymer at the toe, heel, outstep, and instep to protect from rock strikes.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> UDOG’s lace tensioning system anchors on ribbons that wrap underneath your foot.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The shoes also feature the same patented ‘Tension wrap system’ lace system as the road shoes.</p>\n<p>This sees two inverted V-shaped ribbons wrap under your foot through the underside of the upper, sitting between the footbed and outsole. The laces then pass through these ribbons.</p>\n<p>UDOG claims this design creates 16 points of contact between the upper and your foot, improving support when pedalling or, as this is a gravel shoe, when scrambling up steep slopes.</p>\n<p>UDOG uses flat laces that, according to the brand, don’t stretch like a round lace. The laces can then be tucked into an elasticated pocket at the top of the tongue of the shoe.</p>\n<p>The Distanza is available in two versions – the range-topping Distanza Carbon and the standard Distanza.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The range-topping Distanza Carbon uses a full carbon sole.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As the name implies, the Distanza Carbon uses a carbon outsole. The standard Distanza uses a carbon-reinforced nylon sole.</p>\n<p>UDOG says the Distanza Carbon has road shoe-like levels of stiffness, whereas the more compliant nylon shoe is better suited to multi-day adventures.</p>\n<p>Both models share the full natural rubber tread that covers all but the spine of the outsole and the cleat plate.</p>\n<p>The chunky rand that wraps fully over the toe box of the upper is a feature we haven’t previously come across in a gravel shoe.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Distanza starts at £160/€250/$200 for the Distanza (right) and £220/€250/$300 for the Distanza Carbon (left).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>We’ve got both the Distanza carbon and the Distanza in for testing. Our sample shoes (size 45 EU/10.5 UK) weigh in at 379g each for the Distanza Carbon and 383g each for the standard Distanza.</p>\n<p>The shoes are available now and priced at £220/€250/$300 for the Distanza Carbbon or £160/€250/$200 for the standard Distanza.</p>","author":"Warren Rossiter","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"9d1ed0b529e24ffe4770a3df6ad5d4126be317f724ea79c36a2953af7f37a9ed","category":"Cycling"}
