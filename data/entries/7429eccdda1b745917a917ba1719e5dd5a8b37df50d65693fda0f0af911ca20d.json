But as Apple’s plans take shape, it also seems possible that we’ll see new Mac desktops featuring high-end M2 Max and M2 Ultra chips.</p>\n\n<p>Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-31/apple-tests-new-high-end-mac-chips-ahead-of-developer-conference\">believes</a> that these new chips are most likely to power an updated range of Mac Studio desktops, a little over a year <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/mac-studio-review-a-nearly-perfect-workhorse-mac/\">after the first Studios were initially introduced</a>. As recently as a few months ago, Gurman <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/02/apple-could-skip-an-m2-mac-studio-update-to-boost-apple-silicon-mac-pro/\">speculated</a> that the M2 generation would skip over the Mac Studio entirely and that Apple would instead opt to use the newer chips as a selling point for a new Apple Silicon Mac Pro.</p>\n<p>But that version of reality may not come to pass. Gurman says these new Mac models have Mac14,3 and Mac14,4 model identifiers, while the Mac Pro that Apple is testing internally is identified as Mac14,8. (We initially thought these no-adjective model identifiers were <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/all-the-tidbits-weve-gleaned-about-the-mac-studio-studio-display-and-m1-ultra/\">a throwback to the PowerPC days</a>, but the reality is more boring; Apple just isn’t using unique Mac names in model identifiers anymore, possibly to combat leaks and the speculation that arises when new IDs break cover.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943502#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943502&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7429eccdda1b745917a917ba1719e5dd5a8b37df50d65693fda0f0af911ca20d","category":"Tech"}
