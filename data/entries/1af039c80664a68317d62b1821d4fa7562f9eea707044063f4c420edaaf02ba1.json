The commitment comes following a recent meeting between CEO Tim Cook and President Donald Trump.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/Apple-Logo-Cash-Feature-Yellow.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2676\" height=\"1504\" />\r<br />\nThe tech giant's plans include the construction of a new server manufacturing facility in Houston, where Apple and Foxconn will produce servers for Apple's Private Cloud Compute system. The 250,000-square-foot facility is scheduled to open next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will also establish a supplier academy in Michigan, \"to train the next generation of US manufacturers,\" and will expand its data center presence across multiple states, including Arizona, Oregon, Iowa, Nevada, and North Carolina. The company confirmed that chip production has already begun at TSMC's Arizona facility, which is currently manufacturing components for some Apple Watch and iPad models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe 20,000 new jobs Apple plans to create will focus primarily on research and development, silicon engineering, and artificial intelligence. This matches the company's previous hiring wave, which added 20,000 R&amp;D positions over the last five years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn Detroit, Apple plans to double down on manufacturing education by opening a dedicated academy to support smaller companies. The tech giant is also doubling its US manufacturing fund to $10 billion.\r<br />\n<blockquote>\"We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we're proud to build on our long-standing US investments with this $500 billion commitment to our countryâ€™s future,\" Cook said in a statement. \"We'll keep working with people and companies across this country to help write an extraordinary new chapter in the history of American innovation.\"</blockquote>The announcement is likely to have been strategically timed, given that Trump has threatened to impose an additional 10% tax on Chinese imports. Cook  previously succeeded in protecting the iPhone from tariffs during Trump's first term by arguing that such measures would end up benefiting competitors like Samsung.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/apple-announces-500b-us-investment-plan/\">Apple Announces $500B US Investment Plan, Adding 20K Jobs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-500b-us-investment-plan-adding-20k-jobs.2450064/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1af039c80664a68317d62b1821d4fa7562f9eea707044063f4c420edaaf02ba1","category":"Apple"}
