One covers seven launches with groups of spacecraft for the Space Development Agency's constellation of missile tracking and data relay satellites. The other task order is a single mission for the National Reconnaissance Office, the US government's spy satellite agency.</p>\n<h2>Two eligible bidders</h2>\n<p>The parameters of the competition limited the bidders to SpaceX and United Launch Alliance (ULA). SpaceX won both task orders for a combined value of $733.5 million, or roughly $91.7 million per mission. All the missions will launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, beginning as soon as late 2025.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/spacex-sweeps-latest-round-of-military-launch-contracts/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/spacex-sweeps-latest-round-of-military-launch-contracts/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a0bb7078590d134d4a0c90b7742da646ef44d3ec12e0a71f258a881c9e4868e1","category":"Tech"}
