He has spent the last seven years as a journalist, photographer and product reviewer. We asked him a few questions about his life in cycling. </span></p>\n<p><b>What bike made you fall in love with cycling?</b></p>\n<p><span>As a kid, I did a lot of BMX riding. Everything from dirt jumps to racing. I was never great, but as a kid, it was a lot of fun, and the independence the bike offered was what kept me pedaling. As I got a bit older, my dad invited me on mountain bike rides, and I instantly fell in love. I remember when I got my first carbon fiber bike, a Trek Y22. This definitely wasn’t my first bike, but it was the first one that really felt special. I held onto that bike for a very long time and wish I wouldn’t have sold it 10 years ago! </span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Trek-Y22-7613-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /><figcaption><span>A Trek Y22 was Troy’s first bike that really felt special.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span><br />\n</span><b>Growing up, your family vacations centered around cycling. Where did those take you?</b></p>\n<p><span>My family always did family vacations by car. We would drive everywhere, and it felt like every trip revolved around some riding destination. Sometimes it was a new trail my dad had read about, and other times it was a trip up to Mackinac Island to ride the island and explore with no cars. It didn’t matter where we were going, we always seemed to be packing a helmet.</span><span><br />\n</span><span><br />\n</span><b>Your other passion is cars?</b></p>\n<p><span>I have a love-hate relationship with vehicles. I love unique cars and just about anything that is old. The challenge of keeping an older car roadworthy is fun. It is the hunt that I love the most. Whether it is parts or the vehicles themselves, hunting for parts that are no longer made is so rewarding when you finally find what you need. I have a few projects, but the one that gets the most attention is my 1989 VW TriStar Syncro Doppelkabine (Doka, as most know them). It is a pretty rare truck, with only 500 ever made. They were never sold in North America, so finding parts is a hell of a hunt and a lot of Google Translate. Luckily the VW community is awesome, and it does share a few parts with the Vanagon.</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Chilao-1-1-2022-1048-1340x893.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"893\" /><figcaption><span>Troy’s super rare 1989 VW TriStar Syncro Doppelkabine.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span><br />\n</span><b>How has cycling shaped your life?</b></p>\n<p><span>Cycling has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. My entire family rides, and my younger brother also works in the cycling industry. We were mostly mountain bike focused when I was growing up, but road and now gravel have been a great way to build fitness and structure. I love the tech side of cycling the most and look at things from a different view than the normal road racer. Cycling is always evolving, and I really like the balance of tradition with modern data acquisition. It is an awesome time for cyclists of all levels and abilities. </span><span><br />\n</span><span><br />\n</span><b>The perfect day of cycling?</b></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/RAN_3152-1340x888.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"888\" /><figcaption><span>Troy riding SBT GRVL in August.</span> (Photo: Will Tracy)</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span>That is tough for me because I love all disciplines of cycling. One day it might be a long road ride in the Angeles National forest above my house in Southern California, and the next, an MTB or gravel ride in the same mountains. My next priority is a ride on my e-bike to scout trails and roads for my next adventure. By far, my favorite day on a bike is with my kids. Watching them explore their abilities is something that I would give up any other ride for. </span></p>","author":"Will Tracy","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"061c7a5cfc2bf87be03da927e94aa40771afe79654c036d7d3e703c0fd1d7a12","category":"Cycling"}
