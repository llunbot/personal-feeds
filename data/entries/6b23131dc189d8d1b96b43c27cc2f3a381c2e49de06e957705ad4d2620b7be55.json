The Action button is slightly longer, now resembling a similar length to one of the volume buttons, but with a slightly wider shape to distinguish it. The all-new \"Capture\" button is present on the left-hand side of the device where the mmWave antenna was located on previous models. While it is a similar length to the Side button, it is completely flush with the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>91Mobiles</em> previously revealed accurate CAD renders of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/iphone-13-pro-thicker-and-larger-rear-camera/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/16/iphone-14-pro-cad-renders-no-notch/\">iPhone 14 Pro</a>, but its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/apple-watch-series7-cad-larger-display/\">Apple Watch Series 7 designs</a> were ultimately incorrect. The website recently shared renders purporting to depict the design of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/20/next-gen-ipad-air-with-12-9-inch-display-and-redesigned-camera-unit-revealed-in-cad-renders/\">upcoming 12.9-inch iPad Air</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/iphone-se-4-design-revealed-in-cad-renders/\">fourth-generation iPhone SE</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn January, <em>MacRumors</em> provided the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/iphone-16-pro-design/\">first look at the design of the iPhone 16 Pro</a>, including a Capture button that is flush with the side of the device, which was today broadly corroborated by <em>91Mobiles</em>' CAD file. <em>MacRumors</em> subsequently obtained information suggesting that while Apple tested a longer Action button design, it has since <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/12/apple-iphone-16-pro-action-button-tweaks/\">scrapped the idea</a> and the Action button is now expected to look virtually the same as on the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe main change to the design of the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max is rumored to be larger displays, increasing from 6.1- to 6.3-inches and 6.7- to 6.9-inches, respectively. Following a significant redesign with the switch to a titanium frame and more rounded edges on the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ last year, little else is expected to change with the look of the new devices this year this year. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> lineup is expected to launch in the fall. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/91mobiles-com/\">91Mobiles</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/iphone-16-pro-renders-reveal-button-changes/\">iPhone 16 Pro CAD Renders Reveal Button Design Changes</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-cad-renders-reveal-button-design-changes.2421395/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6b23131dc189d8d1b96b43c27cc2f3a381c2e49de06e957705ad4d2620b7be55","category":"Apple"}
