Advisors can then relay the info to customers in online chats or on the phone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Ask\" will automatically respond to a query with relevant information from Apple's internal knowledge base, and advisors can rate an answer as \"helpful\" or \"unhelpful.\" Advisors can ask up to five follow-up questions per topic. Apple said it plans to make the tool available to more advisors in the future, after collecting feedback.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple encourages participating advisors to use \"Ask\" before using traditional search methods or consulting a senior advisor for info, and it says the tool is useful for solving complex or unfamiliar issues. As the tool is linked to Apple's internal knowledge base, the company ensures that the responses are factual, traceable, and useful.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAn example of a query that \"Ask\" can respond to: \"A customer is unable to update their device to iOS 13.7. What can be done?\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to adopt generative AI in a major way this year. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/\">iOS 18 will include many new generative AI features</a> across Siri, Spotlight, Messages, Health, Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and more, and he was first to report that the AppleCare team would use generative AI to speed up customer support. This is the first time that details about Apple's internal \"Ask\" tool have been reported.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn an earnings call earlier this month, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company was working on generative AI and would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/\">share details \"later this year.\"</a> iOS 18 is expected to be announced at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June, and the update should be released to all users with a compatible iPhone in September.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGenerative AI surged in popularity in late 2022 when OpenAI released <a href=\"https://openai.com/chatgpt\">ChatGPT</a>, a chatbot that can respond to text and voice prompts. The chatbot is trained on large language models, allowing it to respond like a human. OpenAI has also developed tools that can automatically generate <a href=\"https://openai.com/dall-e-3\">images</a> and <a href=\"https://openai.com/sora\">videos</a> based on text prompts.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/\">AppleCare</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/22/applecare-advisors-testing-new-ask-tool/\">AppleCare Support Advisors Testing New ChatGPT-Like Tool 'Ask'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/applecare-support-advisors-testing-new-chatgpt-like-tool-ask.2420196/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c4b001869aad5263cbf86c2a824b6c3bddc5cb540caf39d88de0d2bf71d6a7a7","category":"Apple"}
