A <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/070224zor_2co3.pdf\">list of orders</a> released this morning shows that the court granted a petition for certiorari filed by the Free Speech Coalition, an adult-industry lobby group.</p>\n<p>In March, the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/texas-can-require-age-verification-on-porn-sites-5th-circuit-judges-rule/\">ruled</a> that Texas could continue enforcing the law while litigation continues. In a 2-1 decision, 5th Circuit judges wrote that \"the age-verification requirement is rationally related to the government's legitimate interest in preventing minors' access to pornography. Therefore, the age-verification requirement does not violate the First Amendment.\"</p>\n<p>The dissenting judge faulted the 5th Circuit majority for reviewing the law under the \"rational-basis\" standard instead of the more stringent strict scrutiny. The Supreme Court \"has unswervingly applied strict scrutiny to content-based regulations that limit adults' access to protected speech,\" Judge Patrick Higginbotham wrote at the time.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034992#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034992&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"51457a4b95ab63c0a817490283ae258559a7a8f482076e6cf014b31288b054ac","category":"Tech"}
