Yesterday was a weird day...<br /><br />1. Two men broke into one of our retail locations. Why? To cut a hole in our bathroom wall to access the Apple Store next door and steal $500k worth of IphonesðŸ™„<br /><br />2.

Nothing was stolen from the coffee shop, but it will cost $1,500 to replace locks and repair the bathroom wall.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo employees were at the â€ŒApple Storeâ€Œ when the theft happened as the Alderwood Mall had closed for the night. An Alderwood spokesperson said they were working with the police to solve the incident, but Apple has not yet commented.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/06/washington-apple-store-theft/\">Washington Apple Store Robbed of $500,000 in iPhones After Thieves Tunnel Through Coffee Shop Wall</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/washington-apple-store-robbed-of-500-000-in-iphones-after-thieves-tunnel-through-coffee-shop-wall.2386121/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3cdad99017172af5dcec667b301f8e0e231be5573dd5d4dffa8c97e88e45bfeb","category":"Apple"}
