The new kick bike claims to cut carbon emissions by more than 50% in production. This pint-sized push bike isn’t just about teaching toddlers how to balance; it’s a masterclass in sustainable bike design. Built with a recycled carbon fiber (rCarbon) chassis, 12-inch wheels, and kid-friendly geometry, the Pre rCarbon is all about smooth, stable, and speedy fun—without the environmental baggage. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Recycled-materials-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1796\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Recycled-materials-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Recycled materials\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Recycled-materials-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Recycled-materials-297x208.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Recycled-materials-1536x1078.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Recycled-materials-120x84.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Recycled-materials-768x539.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Recycled-materials-2048x1437.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(Images: Giant) </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>An (eco) Balanced Bike </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At just 2.5kg (5.5 lbs), the Pre rCarbon is one of the lightest balance bikes out there, thanks to its full-carbon frameset. <em>Here’s the kicker:</em> that carbon isn’t fresh off the production line. Giant has taken long-strand recycled carbon fibers, molded them with a proprietary high-pressure, low-void process, and created a frame, fork, and components that rival traditional carbon fiber’s strength and performance. While claiming to cut carbon emissions by more than 50%. (We know, shipping these bikes, and the environmental cost of freight, production, etc, is nearly voiding the environmental gains….but we’re just here to talk about the bike product…right now)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rCarbon-technology-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1669\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rCarbon-technology-scaled.webp\" alt=\"rCarbon technology\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rCarbon-technology-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rCarbon-technology-297x194.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rCarbon-technology-1536x1001.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rCarbon-technology-120x78.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rCarbon-technology-768x501.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rCarbon-technology-2048x1335.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the frame and fork, Giant keeps the sustainability streak going with an integrated one-piece handlebar/stem unit, a combined saddle/seatpost, and even the wheels—all crafted from rCarbon. Add kid-friendly touchpoints like soft, grippy recycled rubber grips, an ergonomic no-slip saddle. Plus easy-rolling 1.75-inch tires (made from ocean-reclaimed Seawastex nylon), and you’ve got a heck of a kids’ bike that’s fairly eco-conscious.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-action-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-action-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Pre rCarbon action\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-action-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-action-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-action-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-action-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-action-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-action-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-action-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-action-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Designed for Fun and Stability</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pre rCarbon isn’t just about creating a less environmentally impactful product. It’s about having fun and a long-lasting piece of kid kit that can hopefully stand the test of time (hopefully). Its low center of gravity and forward-leaning geometry put little riders in the perfect position for a natural, powerful push-off. The 12-inch rCarbon wheels feature low-resistance hubs, helping the bike glide effortlessly over sidewalks, park paths, and even light gravel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Easy-assembly-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1685\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Easy-assembly-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Easy assembly\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Easy-assembly-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Easy-assembly-297x196.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Easy-assembly-1536x1011.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Easy-assembly-120x79.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Easy-assembly-768x506.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Easy-assembly-2048x1348.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Setup is a breeze, too. With an auto-aligned fork, handlebar, and protective padding built right in, this push bike arrives 90% assembled right out of the box. No messing with small parts, no hunting for tools—pop on the wheels and get rolling.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-studio-profile-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-studio-profile-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Pre rCarbon studio profile\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-studio-profile-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-studio-profile-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-studio-profile-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-studio-profile-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-studio-profile-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-studio-profile-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Sustainability in Every Detail</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Giant is going all in on recycled materials, and it’s very refreshing to see. Here’s a breakdown of the eco-friendly tech packed into the Pre rCarbon:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>rCARBON:</strong> Recycled long-strand carbon fiber used in the frame, fork, bars, seatpost, and wheels, reducing carbon emissions by over 50%.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>rEVA:</strong> The saddle top is made from recycled ethylene vinyl acetate, cutting emissions by 20%.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>rPP:</strong> Grips are crafted from discarded polypropylene, offering a 20% emissions reduction.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>rTPR:</strong> Thermoplastic rubber grips that provide durability while slashing raw material emissions by 11%.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Seawastex Tires:</strong> Made from ocean plastics, these tire casings reduce carbon impact by 11%.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-studio-angle-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-studio-angle-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Pre rCarbon studio angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-studio-angle-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-studio-angle-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-studio-angle-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-studio-angle-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-studio-angle-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pre-rCarbon-studio-angle-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Future of Kids’ Bikes?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Though I don’t see the future of kid balance bikes being all carbon, I do like the idea of less environmental impact – thats for sure. With 50% of its materials from recycled sources, high quality and sustainability don’t have to be at odds. For parents who want their kids’ bike to match their Giant TCR, this is the balance bike to beat. <strong>Price:</strong> $500</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/bikes/kids-bikes/5-9-years-20-inch-\">Giant-Bicycles.com</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/giant-pre-rcarbon-500-sustainable-recycled-carbon-balance-bike/\">Giant Pre rCarbon: A $500 Sustainable Recycled Carbon Balance Bike</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"574644a5d4dea6eeba2545fb24b3cf1c6fe5bb59db9334a0ee9ed27a5df6aeca","category":"Cycling"}
