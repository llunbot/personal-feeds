After updating to the new software, you can drag files from an ‌iPhone‌ to a Mac and vice versa.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macos-sequoia-iphone-mirroring.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n‌iPhone‌ Mirroring makes it simple to move files from one device to another because it works even when the ‌iPhone‌ is locked and charging. To use the feature, update to the fifth macOS 15.1 and iOS 18.1 betas and then activate ‌iPhone‌ Mirroring. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nFrom there, if you drag a file like a photo from Mac to the open <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> app on the ‌iPhone‌, it'll transfer over. If you want to transfer a PDF, just open the Files app and then drag the PDF from the Mac to the ‌iPhone‌. Dragging a file from ‌iPhone‌ to Mac works in much the same way, you simply drag it over where you want it. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/drag-and-drop-files-app-mac.jpg\" width=\"752\" height=\"1008\" />\r<br />\nThe new ‌iPhone‌ Mirroring feature is active in the developer beta now, and public beta testers should be able to try it out later this week. iOS 18.1 and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 are expected to see a public launch in October. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/drag-and-drop-files-iphone-mirroring/\">Drag and Drop Files Now Work With iPhone Mirroring in Latest macOS Sequoia 15.1 and iOS 18.1 Betas</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/drag-and-drop-files-now-work-with-iphone-mirroring-in-latest-macos-sequoia-15-1-and-ios-18-1-betas.2437856/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"01bc32320f1a8b4ee66c71754f0c15041b77c74035335ad8f23c162e6371a7a7","category":"Apple"}
