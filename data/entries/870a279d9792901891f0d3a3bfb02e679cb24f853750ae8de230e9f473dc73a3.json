On Thursday, TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/apples-new-macos-sequoia-update-is-breaking-some-cybersecurity-tools/\">reported</a> that several third-party security tools have reported issues with the new version of the Mac operating system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to TechCrunch, the source of the problem is not clear. Security firm <a href=\"https://www.cio.com/article/3476789/crowdstrike-failure-what-you-need-to-know.html\">CrowdStrike</a> made a vague reference to “changes in the network stack” in an alert sent to its customers and decided hold off on support for the new OS. In a statement to TechCrunch, Patrick Wardle of DoubleYou quipped, “maybe if Apple spent less time and money on marketing, and more time on actually testing their software, we’d all be better off!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The TechCrunch report does not address whether the companies had performed testing with betas of macOS Sequoia before its official release and if this is a new issue that has appeared. Apple released the developer beta of Sequoia at WWDC last June and updated the beta regularly ahead of its release to the general public on Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other companies in TechCrunch’s report include ESET, Microsoft, and SentinelOne. ESET addresses the issue in a <a href=\"https://support.eset.com/en/alert8723-network-connection-lost-after-upgrading-to-macos-15-with-eset-macos-product-v6?ref=esf\">post</a>, pointing out that the problem is with ESET Cyber Security version 6, an older version that “will be End of Life soon.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same report also stated that Firefox had issues with Sequoia. A <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/1fif1gr/comment/lnlbxsy/\">Reddit post</a> suggests that the issue is firewall-related and a Terminal command provides a fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release of a major update to macOS generates a lot of buzz and excitement, which can cause users to upgrade their Macs as soon as the software becomes available. But it’s usually a good idea to wait a few days or weeks before updating, especially if you have a heightened concern for security or can’t afford any downtime. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might even be a good idea to wait for the first point release update from Apple or any updates for mission-critical apps you use. If you use a company-issued Mac, you need to check with your IT department first–IT has likely put provisions on your Mac to prevent the installation, anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A CrowdStrike sales engineer said the company is working on the issue but isn’t optimistic for a patch from Apple: “While we would love for there to be a fast-follow patch that resolves this for us, we’re acting under the assumption there won’t be and we’ll need to fix it in our code with a sensor release.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn more about the new version of the Mac operating system in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS Sequoia superguide</a>.
