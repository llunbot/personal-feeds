You’ll also get a speedy M2 processor, all-day battery life, fast charging with MagSafe, and a pair of Thunderbolt ports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/807892/m2-macbook-air-review.html\">4.5-star review</a>, we praised the 15-inch Air’s “bright, sharp and colorful” display, but that’s nothing compared to what Vision Pro will turn it into. So grab one now and get ready for the age of spatial computing.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4f26ca9469ff591f3130b7e1ec6737dad3ad5c1e2758cd5f1d33cfdd472c0b5d","category":"Apple"}
