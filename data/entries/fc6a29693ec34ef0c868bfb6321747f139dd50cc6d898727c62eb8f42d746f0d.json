{"title":"Netflix Will Stop Reporting Subscriber Numbers Next Year","link":"https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/netflix-stop-reporting-subscriber-numbers-starting-2025-1235975341/","date":1713482708000,"content":"\n<p>Todd Spangler, reporting for Variety:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Netflix will no longer report subscriber numbers — which has been \na key metric for streaming services for years — beginning with \nthe first quarter of 2025. </p>\n\n<p>The company made the announcement in releasing <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/netflix-subscribers-2024-q1-earnings-1235975242/\">its first-quarter \n2024 earnings</a> Thursday. Netflix handily topped expectations \nfor subscribers net adds, gaining 9.33 million in the period, to \nreach nearly 270 million globally. It also beat Wall Street \nexpectations on the top and bottom lines. [...] </p>\n\n<p>Despite the Q1 earnings beat, Netflix shares dropped more than \n4.5% in after-hours trading Thursday, possibly as investors \nreacted negatively to the news that the streamer will stop \nreporting quarterly sub totals. </p>\n\n<p>In its Q1 letter to shareholders, Netflix said that engagement — time spent with the service — is its “best proxy for customer \nsatisfaction.” As such, it will no longer report quarterly \nmembership numbers or average revenue per member (which it dubs \n“ARM”), as of Q1 2025. Netflix said it will announce “major \nsubscriber milestones as we cross them” but will cease disclosing \nquarterly subscriber numbers. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t think investors should be alarmed. This is what companies do when their growth phase is over. Apple used to break down unit sales for its various devices and stopped long ago. Netflix is no longer an up-and-comer — they’re the established leader in streaming, and should be judged accordingly.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/18/netflix-numbers\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"fc6a29693ec34ef0c868bfb6321747f139dd50cc6d898727c62eb8f42d746f0d","category":"Tech"}
