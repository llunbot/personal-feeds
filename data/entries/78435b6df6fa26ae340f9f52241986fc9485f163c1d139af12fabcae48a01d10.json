Chennaoui has become synonymous with cycling, but it wasn’t always the case. She talks us through how she came to work in cycling, her favourite cycling rivalry, and she reflects on the growth of women’s cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also shares her hidden talent (spoiler, it’s a good one), discusses sticking to her values and explains why her Instagram bio reads ‘balls may drop’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more on Chennaoui’s story, check out <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Cyclist </em>issue 139, out now</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes/77-orla-chennaoui-the-face-of-pro-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 77 now on Acast</a></strong></li><li><strong>Check out </strong><a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>all episodes</strong></a></li><li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pippa-york-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 76: Polka dot jersey winner Pippa York on finding happiness</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/will-butler-adams-brompton\">Two wheels good: Will Butler-Adams, the man behind Brompton</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 139: on sale now!</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<p><em>We’ve partnered with Quotezone on a prize draw to win a one year subscription to Cyclist magazine worth over £75.
