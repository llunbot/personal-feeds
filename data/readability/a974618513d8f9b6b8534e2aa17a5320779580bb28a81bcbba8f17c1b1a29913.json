What initially started as a collaboration with King Cage, where WTC made the Morse mounting plate, has evolved into a full titanium cage made in-house at the WTC facility in Minneapolis. As a refresher, the Morse cage uses a series of dot and dash mounting holes to offer 32mm of vertical adjustmentâ€”with each mounting position using a dot on one end to make it impossible for the cage to slip.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/14112711/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Morse-Cage-black-cerakote-gold-finish-water-bottle-cage-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/14112711/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Morse-Cage-black-cerakote-gold-finish-water-bottle-cage-2.jpg\" alt=\"WTC Morse Cage Ti black water bottle cage made from titanium\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/14112711/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Morse-Cage-black-cerakote-gold-finish-water-bottle-cage-2.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/14112711/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Morse-Cage-black-cerakote-gold-finish-water-bottle-cage-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/14112711/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Morse-Cage-black-cerakote-gold-finish-water-bottle-cage-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/14112711/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Morse-Cage-black-cerakote-gold-finish-water-bottle-cage-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/14112711/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Morse-Cage-black-cerakote-gold-finish-water-bottle-cage-2-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>In addition to the gold, WTC is now offering a black Cerakote finish as well.
