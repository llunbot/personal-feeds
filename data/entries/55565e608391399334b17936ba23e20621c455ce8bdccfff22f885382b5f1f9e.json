Already loved for its ability to wick sweat away from the rider’s head, the thick soft breathable Resistex Carbon padding actually gets much bigger inside the new Utopia Y. The Resistex Carbon liner now extends all the way across the front of the helmet – from temple to temple – to help wick sweat away from the forehead and keep it from dripping down into your eyes or the back of sunglass lenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_new-retention.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_new-retention-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Kask Utopia Y aero road helmet updated with improved fit &amp; finish, new dial retention\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_new-retention-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_new-retention-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_new-retention-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_new-retention-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_new-retention-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_new-retention-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_new-retention.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, the new Utopia Y gets upgrade retention, moving to Kask’s new top Octofit+ adjustment system that better cradles the occipital base of the rider’s head, extending further down the nape of the neck for improved stability. The new retention also features a larger rubber-covered dial for easier adjustment, and pairs with Kask’s lightweight webbing strap and soft synthetic leather chin strap.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Updated Kask Utopia Y look – Pricing &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_front.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_front-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Kask Utopia Y aero road helmet updated with improved fit &amp; finish, front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_front-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_front-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_front-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_front-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_front-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_front-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_front.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated Kask Utopia Y comes in the same three sizes (S-L) with a 260g claimed weight (M).

Now the aero road helmet adds more low-key reflective graphics to boost rider visibility out on the road, and is available in more subdued colors – classic matte white or matte black, plus shiny gloss white, gray, red, Oxford blue, and black.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_Tenerife.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_Tenerife-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Kask Utopia Y aero road helmet updated with improved fit &amp; finish, sunset ride\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_Tenerife-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_Tenerife-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_Tenerife-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_Tenerife-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_Tenerife-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_Tenerife-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_Tenerife-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kask-Utopia-Y-vented-aero-road-bike-helmet-updated-with-improved-fit-and-finish_Tenerife.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all c.
