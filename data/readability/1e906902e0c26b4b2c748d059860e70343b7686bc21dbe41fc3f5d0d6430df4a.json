Apparently, they are beta testing a new “<em>Mute activity upload from feed</em>” feature that will allow users to keep every one of their public activities from spamming the clubs &amp; friends who follow them with every little ride they do.</p><p>That might be a nice way to for example allow riders to upload their commutes or regular repeated rides to their own public profile, while reserving the big push out to everyone’s feeds for bigger or more unique rides that you might actually want to share more with friends &amp; your riding clubs. Word is that the test group will run with the new feature for another couple of weeks before Strava decides whether to open up the function to their full audience.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.strava.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Strava.com</em></a></p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1e906902e0c26b4b2c748d059860e70343b7686bc21dbe41fc3f5d0d6430df4a","category":"Cycling"}
