The company recognized early on that, even though its owners slow-charged at home each night, knowing they had the ability to rapidly recharge on the road was critical in making an electric vehicle an acceptable alternative to existing vehicles.</p>\n<p>Since then, it has built out more than 2,000 charging stations in the US alone, with more than 25,000 plugs. More than that, the chargers invariably work, something that is often not true for other charging networks.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024018#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024018&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
