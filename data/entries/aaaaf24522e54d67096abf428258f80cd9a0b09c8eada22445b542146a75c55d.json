Since launch, the speaker has not seen significant hardware revisions, though Apple did introduce new colors in November 2021 and activated the devices' temperature and humidity sensors via software updates earlier this year. The introduction of the ‌HomePod mini‌ in two more countries makes the prospect of a second-generation model being released anytime soon pretty unlikely.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2021, Apple phased out the original full-size ‌HomePod‌, but it launched a second-generation version in January. This new ‌HomePod‌ retains a design similar to its predecessor but includes an enlarged backlit touch interface and several other enhancements. Both the new ‌HomePod‌ and ‌HomePod mini‌ are Siri-based smart speakers, and come with Matter compatibility and support for stereo pairing.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/thailand/\">Thailand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/malaysia/\">Malaysia</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini\">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/homepod-lineup-launching-malaysia-thailand-may-10/\">HomePod and HomePod Mini Launch in Malaysia and Thailand on May 10</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/homepod-and-homepod-mini-launch-in-malaysia-and-thailand-on-may-10.2425112/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aaaaf24522e54d67096abf428258f80cd9a0b09c8eada22445b542146a75c55d","category":"Apple"}
