This Recovery HD partition contains the latest version of the macOS you installed on your Mac and makes it possible to troubleshoot issues with your Mac. It is a useful tool that the majority of Mac users will never need to use, unless one of the following applies:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>You need to wipe a Mac because you want to sell it or pass it on to a new user. macOS Recovery will allow you to wipe your Mac, removing your data and your Apple ID.

These options work on an Intel-powered Mac:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Command+R</strong>: Use this if you want to install the latest version of macOS that you had installed on your Mac (it won’t install a newer version if you haven’t upgraded). Note that if you’re selling or giving away a Mac that is using OS X El Capitan or earlier you should also use Command + R–this will make sure that the installation isn’t associated with your Apple ID.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Option/Alt+Command+R</strong>: Use this if you want to upgrade to the latest version of macOS that is compatible with your Mac.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Shift+Option+Command+R</strong>: This will install the version of macOS that came with your Mac, or the one closest to that version if it isn’t available as a download.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<div><div>\n<div><div>\n<h2>Mac Recovery Mode options</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you start up in Recovery Mode you will see the following options:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Restore from a Time Machine backup</strong>: If you have a Time Machine backup this is an easy way to restore your system</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reinstall macOS</strong> : This will allow you to reinstall macOS (the version will depend on the key combination used above)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Safari</strong> (or <strong>Get Help Online</strong> in older versions): To access Apple’s support web pages. This gives you access to Safari so you can look for the help you need, but some browser features won’t be available.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Disk Utility</strong>: This option allows you to verify and repair connected drives.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Select the option that applies to you and click <em>Continue</em>.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We have various tutorials that might help you here.

Startup Security Utility includes settings that allow your Mac to start up from a trusted startup disk. M-series Macs and Macs with the T2 chip have additional options including Firmware password protection, Secure Boot, and External Boot options. It is in this second section that you will find Allow booting from external or removable media. You will need this selected to boot from a bootable drive.

In this case, double press the power button: first press it, release it, and then press and hold down the power button. Fallback recovery mode accesses a second copy of the recoveryOS on the SSD of the Macs with an M-series chip. Apple says the second copy is there for resiliency. There is no Internet Recovery for M-series Macs as there is for Intel Macs.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h3>Intel Macs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can try forcing it to boot in macOS Recovery over the internet. Internet Recovery Mode allows you to download a new copy of macOS over the internet so that you can reinstall it on your Mac. This only works on Macs from 2011 or later, and you will need OS X Lion or later installed.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how to do that:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>On an Intel Mac hold down Option/Alt-Command-R or Shift-Option/Alt-Command-R at startup to force macOS Recovery to boot over the Internet.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We have more tips for <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672001/command-r-not-working-how-to-reinstall-macos-if-recovery-wont-work.html\">booting without a Recovery partition</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you still can’t boot then you could try <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671308/how-to-create-a-bootable-usb-macos-installer.html\">booting via an external Mac startup disk.</a></p>\n\nPersonal Software</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"871db1880e55287968c6e0f5004968c92212e698d64b12a713ca5e905dd1c859","category":"Apple"}
