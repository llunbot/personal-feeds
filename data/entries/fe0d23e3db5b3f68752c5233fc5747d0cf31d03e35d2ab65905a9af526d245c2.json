It has been around the longest, has the largest factory, sells the most games, and releases more titles per year than anyone else. For years, it was the sole remaining pinball company in the world.</p>\n<p>Now—despite the decline of arcades—pinball is seeing a second life. A passionate collector base dedicates entire game rooms in their homes to machines. Pinball and bars go together so well Stern has a whole video series on “<a href=\"https://sternpinball.com/brewcadehopping/\">brewcade hopping</a>”. There are games in <a href=\"https://www.revengeof.com\">comics shop</a>s. One of my more amazing local spots is in the <a href=\"https://ontiltpinball.com\">back of a Korean BBQ</a>. All this interest has created a thriving pinball ecosystem of boutique makers, where success is often measured in sales of 1,000 machines or fewer. Other pinball companies might not compete with Stern directly by volume, but they do provide a level of competition for ideas that keeps the hobby strong.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022246#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022246&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Aurich Lawson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fe0d23e3db5b3f68752c5233fc5747d0cf31d03e35d2ab65905a9af526d245c2","category":"Tech"}
