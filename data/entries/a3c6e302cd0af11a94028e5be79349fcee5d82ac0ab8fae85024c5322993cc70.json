trainer\" title=\"Wahoo Kickr Core smart trainer\" />                                            <p>Wahoo has dropped the price of two of its most popular smart trainers – the Kickr Snap and Kickr Core – and introduced a range of bundle deals.</p>\n<p>Those bundle deals include a new partnership with Zwift, the leading <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-indoor-cycling-apps/\">indoor cycling app</a>, to incorporate a one-year Zwift membership across the Kickr range, covering <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advertising-feature/wahoo-indoor-cycling-ecosystem/\">Wahoo’s line-up of smart trainers, indoor bikes and smart rollers</a>.</p>\n<p>However, Wahoo appears to have kept a keen eye on value for its entry-level, wheel-on smart trainer, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/resistance-trainer/wahoo-kickr-snap-review/\">Kickr Snap</a>, and the brand’s mid-range, direct-drive <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/resistance-trainer/wahoo-kickr-core-review/\">Kickr Core</a>.</p>\n<p>The Kickr Snap’s recommended retail price has been reduced permanently from £429.99 to £349.99 ($399.99 / CA$739.99 / €399.99), including the 12-month Zwift membership.</p>\n<p>The Kickr Core, meanwhile, has dropped from £699.99 to £549.99 ($599.99 / CA$729.99 / €599.99) in a new bundle that includes both a pre-installed <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/bike-cassettes/\">cassette</a> (Wahoo will offer a choice of 8/9/10/11/12-speed cassette options) and the 12-month Zwift membership.</p>\n<p>The rest of Wahoo’s Zwift offers, with a 12-month membership included, run as follows:</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wahoo Kickr Bike</strong> – £3,599.99 / $4,099.99 / CA$5,439.99 / €4,099.99</li>\n<li><strong>Wahoo Kickr Bike Shift</strong> – £2,799.99 / $3,099.99 / CA$4,339.99 / €3,099.99</li>\n<li><strong>Wahoo Kickr Move</strong> – £1,499.99/ $1,699.99/ CA$2,289.99 / €1,699.99</li>\n<li><strong>Wahoo Kickr</strong> – £1,199.99 / $1,399.99 / CA$2,019.99 / €1,399.99</li>\n<li><strong>Wahoo Kickr Rollr</strong> – £649.99 / $699.99 / CA$939.99 / €699.99</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>All of the offers above will be available exclusively through <a href=\"https://uk.wahoofitness.com/\" target=\"_blank\">wahoofitness.com</a> and <a href=\"https://www.zwift.com/eu\" target=\"_blank\">zwift.com</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\"

trainers.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>However, if you purchase a Kickr Core through a retailer, rather than the Wahoo website, the standalone price of the smart trainer has also dropped, from £699.99 to £449.99 / $499.99 / CA$599.99 / €499.99.</p>\n<p>While the offers above – with Zwift included in the package – are available only through the Wahoo and Zwift websites, Wahoo is still offering a discounted 12-month Zwift membership for riders who shop via a retailer.</p>\n<p>This reduces 12 months of Zwift membership to £99.99 / $99.99 / €99.99, when the rider registers their Wahoo hardware.</p>\n<p>Zwift’s standard monthly membership comes in at £12.99 / $14.99 / €14.99 a month, while <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/zwift-announces-cheaper-annual-membership-plan/\">Zwift’s new annual membership package</a> costs £129.99 / $149.99 / €149.99, so there’s a £30 / $50 /  €50 saving to be had.</p>\n<h2>Improved ‘on-boarding’ process</h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Finally, Wahoo says it has also “introduced a brand-new, easy on-boarding process through the Wahoo app”.</p>\n<p>The aim here, according to Wahoo, is to make “the setup of the indoor riding experience much easier and quicker for customers”.</p>\n<p>The Wahoo app can now also log rides from Zwift, so riders, according to the brand, can keep a log of their complete workout history, regardless of whether the ride was recorded on Zwift, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/wahoo-systm-guide/\">Wahoo SYSTM</a> (the brand’s own training app and an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-free-indoor-cycling-apps/\">alternative to Zwift</a>) or outdoors using an Elemnt bike computer.</p>","author":"George
