Judging by the (very unhappy) posts in the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Nest/top/?sort=top&amp;t=week\">Nest subreddit</a>, many users are getting emails detailing exactly how the price increase is affecting their current setup.</p>\n<p>Nest Aware, if you're not aware, is a monthly subscription attached to Nest cameras that allows them to save video to the cloud. Most camera packages would consider this a core functionality, but with a Nest camera, a lot of basic recording functionality is locked behind a monthly subscription. If you're not paying the monthly fee, Nest Cams will only livestream video and allow you to view three hours' worth of \"event\" video—that's video where motion is detected, not 24/7 recording.</p>\n<p>The basic \"Nest Aware\" tier is going from $6 a month, or discounted to $60 annually, to $8 a month/$80 annually, for a 25 percent increase. This gives you 30 days of event video history and facial recognition but still doesn't include any form of 24/7 video recording. For that you'll need \"Nest Aware Plus,\" which is going up from $12 a month/$120 annually to $15 a month/$150 annually, or a 33 percent price increase. This gets you 60 days of event history and, finally, 10 days of 24/7 video recording.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965351#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965351&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"113a6b65fdcddd07691964c1b5edf8d914c4b3f2c2f7746720255849de07066e","category":"Tech"}
