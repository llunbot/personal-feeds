An â€ŒiPhoneâ€Œ on the â€ŒAirPowerâ€Œ charger would also have shown the charge of all of the devices that were placed on the pad. â€ŒAirPowerâ€Œ missed its original 2018 launch date goal, and after a large number of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/09/17/airpower-doomed-to-failure-engineering-issues/\">issues with its development</a>, Apple outright <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/29/apple-officially-cancels-airpower/\">canceled the AirPower project</a> in March 2019.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nImages depicting an â€ŒAirPowerâ€Œ prototype first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/21/alleged-airpower-internals-photos/\">surfaced on social media in August 2020</a>, showing a multi-coil design and the device's internal circuitry, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/05/working-airpower-prototype-shown-in-video-clip/\">first video footage</a> of the device emerged in August 2021. Multiple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/19/video-look-at-airpower-prototype/\">other AirPower prototypes</a> have emerged since then, but most are no longer functional.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>I love itðŸ¤ª <a href=\"https://t.co/tMoPg8ktSU\">pic.twitter.com/tMoPg8ktSU</a></p>â€” Kosutami (@KosutamiSan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KosutamiSan/status/1736315955016581372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 17, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nThe Apple leaker and prototype collector known as \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/\">Kosutami</a>\" recently obtained an early version of the â€ŒAirPowerâ€Œ charging mat. The prototype features 15 charging coils, unlike later revisions that had up to 22 coils, leaving small gaps between them. Like other â€ŒAirPowerâ€Œ prototypes that have emerged in the past, the unit does not feature the white exterior shell that Apple marketed the device with, displaying its internal circuitry more clearly. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn contrast to most other prototypes seen in recent years, Kosutami's unit is largely operational, even when charging an Apple Watch. Rebooting after issuing commands to initiate auto-calibration allowed a large amount of information to be read off the prototype, such as the firmware install date of March 17, 2017, commands for selecting specific coils, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/kosutami-airpower-prototype-charging.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" />\r<br />\nKosutami found that when devices were aligned precisely with one of the charging coils, the â€ŒAirPowerâ€Œ charged steadily at a low voltage, with no noticeable thermal problems. Kosutami told <em>MacRumors</em> that with improper placement, the â€ŒAirPowerâ€Œ proceeds to get extremely hot and can even leave devices with scorch marks. In fact, Kosutami's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> charging case began to melt when charging on the â€ŒAirPowerâ€Œ.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis requirement for precise positioning between devices and the charging coils defeats much of the purpose of the accessory, which Apple touted as more convenient than other Qi wireless chargers that demand careful placement. Apple ultimately addressed this problem with a different technology: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/kosutami-airpower-prototype.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" />\r<br />\nApple subsequently increased the number of coils inside the â€ŒAirPowerâ€Œ in an attempt to mitigate the problem, but found that higher coil density only made overheating worse. No â€ŒAirPowerâ€Œ prototypes have emerged from 2018 or 2019, suggesting that the short-lived device's hardware was almost entirely developed in 2017 or earlier. Instead, software was the subject of a period of iteration before the â€ŒAirPowerâ€Œ project was shelved due to an inability to resolve overheating issues.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRumors in subsequent years about Apple's work on a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/29/kuo-on-apple-first-half-of-2020/\">smaller wireless charger</a> seem to have been related to â€ŒMagSafeâ€Œ or the â€ŒMagSafeâ€Œ Duo charger, rather than â€ŒAirPowerâ€Œ. Nevertheless, a report from reliable <em>Bloomberg</em> journalist <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> last year said that Apple is still looking into <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/apple-developing-airpower-like-charger/\">AirPower-like charging solutions</a> for the future.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpower/\">AirPower</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/prototypes/\">Prototypes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/\">Kosutami</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/19/prototype-shows-why-apple-abandoned-airpower/\">Early Prototype Shows Why Apple Abandoned AirPower</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/early-prototype-shows-why-apple-abandoned-airpower.2414160/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"faa0acc6d35153f1a0f47febc29568a9925e43b8cf6dc80f9175402d2b63b63b","category":"Apple"}
