This behavior seems to have started less than 48 hours after the popular newsletter platform <a href=\"https://on.substack.com/p/introducing-notes\">announced a new product called Notes</a> that will compete directly with Twitter.</p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/binarybits/status/1644309508104024064\">this tweet</a> references my newsletter, understandingai.substack.com. When I try to retweet it, it gives me an error message saying, \"Some actions on this tweet have been disabled by Twitter.\" If I try to reply to the same tweet, I get an error message saying, \"Something went wrong, but don't fret—let's give it another shot.\" Even liking isn't allowed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/binarybits/status/1644309678317268992\">This tweet</a> is identical, except that I linked to my custom domain, understandingai.org. I have no trouble liking, retweeting, or replying to it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929869#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929869&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
