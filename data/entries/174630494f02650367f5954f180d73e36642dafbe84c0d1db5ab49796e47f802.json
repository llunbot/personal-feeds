That update has arrived today in the form of iOS 17.0.3, an update which claims to address \"an issue that may cause iPhone to run warmer than expected,\" as well as patching <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213961\">a pair of security exploits</a>.</p>\n<p>Apple also said that specific apps like Instagram and Uber were also causing phones to heat up and that it was working with developers on fixes. The iPhonedo YouTube channel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6X2ZIkYFsQ\">recently demonstrated</a> that version 302.0 of the Instagram app running on iOS 17 could also make iPhone 14 Pro phones and even an iPad Pro run hot, confirming that the issue wasn't unique to the new phones.</p>\n<p>Initial reports claimed that the iPhone 15 Pro's new Apple A17 Pro chip, its new 3 nm manufacturing process, and/or the phone's new titanium frame could be causing or exacerbating the heat problems. Apple has denied these claims. Even after the fix, you can still expect a new iPhone to run a bit warm during and immediately after initial setup, as it downloads apps and data and performs other background tasks.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973341#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973341&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"174630494f02650367f5954f180d73e36642dafbe84c0d1db5ab49796e47f802","category":"Tech"}
