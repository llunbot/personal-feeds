Throwboy is well-known for its pillows that look like classic Apple products, but the company also has a <a href=\"https://throwboy.com/collections/mens-t-shirts\">popular line of T-shirts</a> that feature designs immediately recognizable by Apple fans.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/throwboy-t-shirts.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"https://throwboy.com/products/9-41-t-shirt\">9:41 shirt</a> highlights the exact time that Steve Jobs unveiled the original iPhone, and a \"<a href=\"https://throwboy.com/collections/mens-t-shirts/products/think-different-again-t-shirt-1\">Think Different (again)</a>\" shirt pairs the famous phrasing with rainbow coloring.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/throwboy-think-different-shirt.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThere's a \"<a href=\"https://throwboy.com/products/1984-pixel-tshirt-red\">1984</a>\" design featuring a mouse pointer and Apple's iconic typeface, along with a \"<a href=\"https://throwboy.com/products/command-rainbow-tshirt\">Command</a>\" shirt, which is Throwboy's most popular. It has the same iconic Command logo featured on all of Apple's Macs. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/throwboy-command-shirt.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple fans will recognize <a href=\"https://throwboy.com/collections/mens-t-shirts/products/hello-t-shirt-black\">the \"Hello\" logo shirt</a> in with bright, colorful letters, and <a href=\"https://throwboy.com/collections/mens-t-shirts/products/iconic-t-shirt\">the Iconic shirt</a>, which has rainbow lettering.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/throwboy-hello-shirt.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nFor Face ID fans, Throwboy has a <a href=\"https://throwboy.com/collections/mens-t-shirts/products/face-t-shirt-white\">new \"Face\" shirt</a> that uses the little icon that Apple uses to represent Face ID in the \"Face ID &amp; Passcode\" section of the Settings app. It comes in either black or white, as do many of Throwboy's other shirts. The Command shirt is available in a <a href=\"https://throwboy.com/collections/mens-t-shirts\">whole rainbow of colors</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/throwboy-face-id-shirt.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThrowboy's shirts are unisex and come in sizes ranging from XS to 4XL, with all of the shirts priced at $32.99. The t-shirts are made from 100 percent cotton and are preshrunk, and they're constructed with double stitched sleeves and hems for durability.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/throwboy-1941-shirt.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nFor those that prefer hoodies and thicker material, many of these designs are also available in <a href=\"https://throwboy.com/collections/outerwear\">sweatshirt form</a>, and there's a Command hat. For kids, there are also <a href=\"https://throwboy.com/collections/youth\">children's versions</a> of the most popular designs, and Throwboy has <a href=\"https://throwboy.com/collections/women\">women's sizing available</a> as well.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThrowboy's t-shirts are great gifts for Apple enthusiasts or an excellent purchase to show off your favorite classic Apple designs.
