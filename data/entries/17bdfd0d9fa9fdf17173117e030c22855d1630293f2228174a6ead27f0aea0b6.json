These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/sept-21-deals.jpg\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/ipad-mini-apple-pencil-green.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-13142085?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-pencil-2nd-generation-6\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$19 OFF</div>Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>MacBook Air</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nAmazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5R2GQW?tag=macrumors-20&amp;th=1&amp;geniuslink=true\"><strong>$1,099.99</strong></a>, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/macbook-air-deals.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order</strong>. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5R2GQW?tag=macrumors-20&amp;th=1&amp;geniuslink=true\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$149 OFF</div>M1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe 256GB model is on sale as well, available for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LNQCX?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1\"><strong>$849.99</strong></a>, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nYou can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-pro-air-deals/\">Best Deals guide</a> for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.
