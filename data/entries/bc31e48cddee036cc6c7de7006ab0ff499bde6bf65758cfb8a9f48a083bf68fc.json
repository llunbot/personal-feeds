So the Rotwild R.R275 X gets a road-inspired fit, high-powered integrated lighting for all the asphalt riding. But it doesn’t skimp on capability to hit the forest paths, gravel roads, and some trails, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new &amp; unique?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rotwild-R-R275-X-lightweight-TQ-powered-integrated-gravel-ebike_angled.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rotwild-R-R275-X-lightweight-TQ-powered-integrated-gravel-ebike_angled.jpg\" alt=\"Rotwild R-R275 X gravel ebike, a lightweight TQ-powered fully integrated all-road e-bike, angled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rotwild-R-R275-X-lightweight-TQ-powered-integrated-gravel-ebike_angled.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rotwild-R-R275-X-lightweight-TQ-powered-integrated-gravel-ebike_angled-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rotwild-R-R275-X-lightweight-TQ-powered-integrated-gravel-ebike_angled-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rotwild-R-R275-X-lightweight-TQ-powered-integrated-gravel-ebike_angled-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rotwild-R-R275-X-lightweight-TQ-powered-integrated-gravel-ebike_angled-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rotwild-R-R275-X-lightweight-TQ-powered-integrated-gravel-ebike_angled-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Rotwild)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While plenty of ebikes let the technology and power-assist sit front &amp; center, Rotwild wanted a more subtle approach for their gravel ebike. That’s why they picked the same smooth TQ HPR50 powertrain &amp; small internal battery that they put in their ultralight trail ebike – <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rotwild-r-x275-sets-new-lightest-trail-emtb-benchmark-at-15-3kg-for-tq-powered-ebike/\" target=\"_blank\">the 15.3kg R.X275</a>.
