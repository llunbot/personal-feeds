That’s tens of millions of iPhone 16 owners who can finally use the feature Apple says the new iPhones were “built for.” (However, we should point out that this release does not enable Phone Mirroring on Macs in the EU due to issues over Digital Markets Act compliance.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For everyone else, there isn’t one standout feature. Rather, iOS 18.4 brings lots of little tweaks, improvements, and changes. Maybe one will stand out for you as the thing you’ve been waiting for, or maybe the sum of them taken together just makes your iPhone a little more pleasant to use. Here’s a by-no-means-complete list of the little things you may come to appreciate about this update.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18.4: 15 minor improvements that make a major impact</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Visual Intelligence</strong> can be triggered in the Control Center or the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2641550/your-iphones-action-button-is-surprisingly-powerful-heres-everything-it-can-do.html\">Action Button</a>. This makes it available on the iPhone 15 Pro, and it means you can add the control to your lock screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve got <strong>AirPods Max</strong>, you’re getting an upgrade (with a firmware update as well, probably) to allow <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2647357/ios-18-4-airpods-max-firmware-update-lossless-and-ultra-low-latency-audio.html\">audio over USB-C</a>, which will include 24-bit, 48 kHz lossless audio and ultra-low-latency audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a <strong>CarPlay</strong> user, you’ll appreciate the new third row of app icons on the home screen (if your display size is large enough) and a new API for sporting events will allow for custom experiences during live sporting broadcasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of driving, <strong>Apple Maps</strong> will now include the location of NACS chargers (that’s the so-called “Tesla connector” appearing on many new EVs).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Got a Vision Pro? Along with support for Apple Intelligence on the headset, there’s a new <strong>Vision Pro iPhone app</strong> that lets you discover spatial experiences, download apps and games, and get tips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a fan of making <strong>Shortcuts</strong>, you’ll love that there are now lots of Shortcut options to change app settings. So you can make apps behave differently based on location or time of day or whatever, if you’re good at making Shortcuts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll notice that <strong>Safari</strong> now shows recent searches when you select the search/address bar, making it easy to repeat that search you just did earlier today. You can clear this at will, or prevent it from showing at all by going to Settings &gt; <em>Safari</em> &gt; <em>Show recent searches</em>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/safari-recent-searches.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"safari recent searches\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/safari-recent-searches.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2691w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/safari-recent-searches.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/safari-recent-searches.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/safari-recent-searches.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/safari-recent-searches.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/safari-recent-searches.jpg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/safari-recent-searches.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/safari-recent-searches.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several tweaks to <strong>Control Center</strong>. Buttons that have more options when you select them show chevrons, the cellular data toggle shows real signal strength, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are new <strong>controls</strong>, too, including four options for Ambient Music: Sleep, Chill, Productivity, and Wellbeing. Each one has multiple playlist options or you can select one of your playlists. Because they’re Control Center controls, you can add them to the lock screen or trigger them with the Action Button, too.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ios18-4-ambient-music.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"ios18 4 ambient music\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ios18-4-ambient-music.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2691w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ios18-4-ambient-music.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ios18-4-ambient-music.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ios18-4-ambient-music.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ios18-4-ambient-music.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ios18-4-ambient-music.jpg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ios18-4-ambient-music.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ios18-4-ambient-music.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an all-new <strong>Apple Intelligence</strong> feature: Prioritize Notifications.
