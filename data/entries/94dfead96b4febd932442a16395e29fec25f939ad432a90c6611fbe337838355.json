Both the Disney+ and Hulu websites say that new and returning subscribers cannot sign up for and pay through Apple, but existing Apple-billed subscribers are not affected.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHulu and Disney+ customers can still watch content on Apple devices by signing into their Hulu and Disney+ accounts in the iOS apps. Disney directs customers to its websites in order to see all plans and sign up for a subscription directly.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor digital purchases like subscription services, Apple collects a 15 to 30 percent fee from each transaction. By removing the option to sign up for streaming services using the in-app purchase system, Disney will not have to pay a fee to Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDisney joins other streaming apps like Netflix that have not offered support for purchasing a subscription in an iOS app for years.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney/\">Disney</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney-plus/\">Disney Plus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/hulu/\">Hulu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/21/hulu-disney-plus-no-app-store-signup/\">Hulu and Disney+ No Longer Support Signups and Payment Using App Store</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hulu-and-disney-no-longer-support-signups-and-payment-using-app-store.2440638/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"94dfead96b4febd932442a16395e29fec25f939ad432a90c6611fbe337838355","category":"Apple"}
