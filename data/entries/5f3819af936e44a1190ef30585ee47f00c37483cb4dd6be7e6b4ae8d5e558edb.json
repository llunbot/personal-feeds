He expects the chip to debut in the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe entire iPhone 16 lineup already supports Wi-Fi 7, so the spec is not much of a surprise, but the fact that the chip will be designed by Apple is notable. Last month, Apple debuted its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/\">custom-designed C1 modem</a> in the iPhone 16e, for cellular connectivity like 5G and LTE, and now the company is expected to make its own Wi-Fi chips too. By designing more of its own chips, Apple can reduce and eventually eliminate its reliance on external suppliers, including Qualcomm for modems and Broadcom for Wi-Fi chips.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's plan to use its own Wi-Fi chip in iPhone 17 models this year was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/kuo-iphone-17-models-apple-designed-wi-fi-7-chip/\">also mentioned by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWi-Fi 7 allows for data transmission over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously, with a supported router, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. Wi-Fi 7 can provide peak speeds of over 40 Gbps, a 4Ã— increase over Wi-Fi 6E, provided a device supports the maximum specifications.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll four iPhone 17 models should launch in around six months from now.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/\">iPhone 17 Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/iphone-17-series-apple-wifi-7-chip/\">All Four iPhone 17 Models Again Rumored to Feature Apple-Designed Wi-Fi 7 Chip</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-four-iphone-17-models-again-rumored-to-feature-apple-designed-wi-fi-7-chip.2453365/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5f3819af936e44a1190ef30585ee47f00c37483cb4dd6be7e6b4ae8d5e558edb","category":"Apple"}
