Truth be told, I forgot all about World Emoji Day almost immediately, but I was reminded again this week when I <a href=\"https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20242r2-emoji-recs-14.pdf\">saw the list</a> of potential new additions being considered by the Unicode Consortium for inclusion into Unicode 14.</p>\n<p>Some of these potential emoji would be useful for talking about the climate emergency—I'm thinking of the <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/melting-face/\">melting face</a> and also the <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/coral/\">coral</a> here. I'm sure we can all use a <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/troll/\">troll</a> in our lives, too, while the <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/saluting-face/\">saluting face</a> will replace the trusty o7. And the <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/low-battery/\">low battery</a> is bound to be popular. There are some new hands, gesturing, <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/index-pointing-at-the-viewer/\">pointing</a>, shaking, and even making <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/heart-hands/\">love hearts</a> to boot.</p>\n<p>A couple of additions might upset some reactionaries on the Internet, however. Specifically, the <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/pregnant-man/\">pregnant man</a> and his gender neutral equivalent, <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/pregnant-person/\">the pregnant person,</a> have been proposed as inclusive additions since pregnancy is possible for some transgender and non-binary people. The world may also soon receive a gender neutral <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/person-with-crown/\">person with a crown</a> option to go with the emoji man and woman wearing crowns.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780509#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780509&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
