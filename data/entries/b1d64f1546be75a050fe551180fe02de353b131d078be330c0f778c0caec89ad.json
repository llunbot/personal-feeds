[...]</p>\n\n<p>As a result of its exceptionally long-lived mission, Voyager 1\nexperiences issues as its parts age in the frigid outer reaches\nbeyond our solar system. When an issue crops up, engineers at\nNASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, have to\nget creative while still being careful of how the spacecraft will\nreact to any changes.</p>\n\n<p>Currently the farthest spacecraft from Earth, Voyager 1 is about\n15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) away. The probe operates\nbeyond the heliosphere — the sun’s bubble of magnetic fields and\nparticles that extends well beyond Pluto’s orbit — where its\ninstruments directly sample interstellar space.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@michael.chabon/post/DACxv6Zuv1F\">Michael Chabon, on Threads</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I find the continuing mission of Voyager 1 so moving, for the way\nits name alone evokes a time of promise, for the thought of that\ntiny contraption way out there in the vastness at the edge of the\nheliosphere — perhaps the farthest any human-made thing may ever\ntravel — a bit battered, swiftly aging, still doing the work it\nwas purposed to do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>An amazing feat of engineering five decades ago, kept going by amazing feats of engineering today.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/18/voyager-thrusters\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b1d64f1546be75a050fe551180fe02de353b131d078be330c0f778c0caec89ad","category":"Tech"}
