He was in touch with\nsomething the rest of us wish we could get to.</p>\n\n<p>Our friendship blossomed on <em>Blue Velvet</em> and then <em>Twin Peaks</em>\nand I always found him to be the most authentically alive person\nI’d ever met.</p>\n\n<p>David was in tune with the universe and his own imagination on a\nlevel that seemed to be the best version of human. He was not\ninterested in answers because he understood that questions are the\ndrive that make us who we are. They are our breath.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/17/maclachlan-lynch\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3bd4829426ba762a99ed8ea36db69d2bd750ed50e861918a8adc5fa0cb82f6c5","category":"Tech"}
