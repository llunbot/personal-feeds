But this time, it isn’t more colors; rather, a new BB standard for the brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New for Wolf Tooth is their T47 Asymmetric Bottom Bracket. Currently, the new BB is only offered in black (we imagine that’ll change) and, like all other Wolf Tooth BBs, it is machined at their headquarters in Minnesota.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WBB-T47A-29-BLK.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WBB-T47A-29-BLK-1536x1536.jpg\" alt=\"New Wolf Tooth T47 Asymmetric Bottom Bracket\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WBB-T47A-29-BLK-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WBB-T47A-29-BLK-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WBB-T47A-29-BLK-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WBB-T47A-29-BLK-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WBB-T47A-29-BLK.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new T47 Asymmetric features low-resistance bearings and a five-seal system to keep dirt and grime out. Everything–bearings, bushings, seals, shape–is a custom design meant for efficient spinning. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also features a unique bushing system that separates the inner race bearing from the crank spindle. This means no metal-on-metal, resulting in a creak-free bottom bracket. Wolf Tooth says the bushing also extends the life of the bearings by helping to keep water out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, Wolf Tooth hasn’t been making bottom brackets for very long. Less than a year ago, they announced they would <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wtc-wolf-tooth-components-t47-external-bottom-brackets/\">start offering BBs</a>, starting with BSA and then T47 BBs, both internal and external. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Wolf-Tooth_T47-Asymmetric-BB_2.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Wolf-Tooth_T47-Asymmetric-BB_2-1536x1920.jpg\" alt=\"New Wolf Tooth T47 Asymmetric Bottom Bracket\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Wolf-Tooth_T47-Asymmetric-BB_2-1536x1920.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Wolf-Tooth_T47-Asymmetric-BB_2-240x300.jpg 240w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Wolf-Tooth_T47-Asymmetric-BB_2-96x120.jpg 96w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Wolf-Tooth_T47-Asymmetric-BB_2-768x960.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Wolf-Tooth_T47-Asymmetric-BB_2-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Wolf-Tooth_T47-Asymmetric-BB_2.jpg 1638w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Wolf-Tooth_T47-Asymmetric-BB_3.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Wolf-Tooth_T47-Asymmetric-BB_3-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"New Wolf Tooth T47 Asymmetric Bottom Bracket\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Wolf-Tooth_T47-Asymmetric-BB_3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Wolf-Tooth_T47-Asymmetric-BB_3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Wolf-Tooth_T47-Asymmetric-BB_3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Wolf-Tooth_T47-Asymmetric-BB_3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Wolf-Tooth_T47-Asymmetric-BB_3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Wolf-Tooth_T47-Asymmetric-BB_3-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Wolf-Tooth_T47-Asymmetric-BB_3.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the colors followed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, like all components from Wolf Tooth, the T47 Asymmetric Bottom Bracket comes with their “Right to Repair” promise. They have replacement parts for all their components, allowing you to replace a small part rather than the entire product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wolf Tooth offers the new T47 Asymmetric Bottom Bracket in 24mm, 29mm, and 30mm spindle diameter options. It retails for $139.95. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out <em><a href=\"https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/\">wolftoothcomponents.com</a></em> for all the details.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wolf-tooth-components-adds-a-t47-asymmetric-bottom-bracket/\">Wolf Tooth Adds T47 Asymmetric Bottom Brackets  </a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Travis Reill","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"30181b5e8e2a6ce39a58797a2f34c5fcc2fcea49434fd80944fe98b6ea2cf915","category":"Cycling"}
