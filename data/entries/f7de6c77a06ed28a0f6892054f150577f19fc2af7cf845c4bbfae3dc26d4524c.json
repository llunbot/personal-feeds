One upgrade we have not seen though is support for the latest Wi-Fi specification, Wi-Fi 7.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Apple-MacBook-Air-hero.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" />\r<br />\nBoth the new M4 MacBook Air and Mac Studio models continue to offer Wi-Fi 6E. While it does offer access to the 6GHz band on supported Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 routers, it's not the latest or fastest technology.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWi-Fi 7, also known as IEEE 802.11be, promises theoretical speeds up to four times faster than its predecessor, as well as reduced latency and improved handling of multiple device connections. Its standout feature is Multi-Link Operation (MLO), which can combine several frequencies across different bands into a single connection for potentially better performance and stability.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's decision not to equip the new Macs with Wi-Fi 7 isn't completely unexpected, given that the MacBook Pro models with M4 chips launched last year also do not feature Wi-Fi 7 support. Still, it's an odd decision when you consider that all iPhone 16 models released in September include Wi-Fi 7 chips from Broadcom. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThat said, the current reality of Wi-Fi 7 adoption makes its absence in Apple's new Macs less significant. Yes, the iPhone 16 series includes Wi-Fi 7 support, but Apple has limited its implementation to the 160MHz bandwidth instead of the full 320MHz that the standard allows. In other words, iPhone 16 models aren't taking full advantage of Wi-Fi 7's potential speed improvements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Mac-Studio-2025.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nThe existing Wi-Fi 6E support in M4 Macs already provides access to the less congested 6GHz band, offering solid performance for current networking needs. Granted, Wi-Fi 7 could have provided some future-proofing for Mac buyers, but its practical benefits won't be widely accessible for some time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn sum, for most Mac users, the absence of Wi-Fi 7 shouldn't be a deciding factor when considering an M4 Mac purchase. The technology remains in its early stages, and Wi-Fi 6E continues to offer robust performance for typical computing tasks, including video conferencing, cloud gaming, and high-resolution streaming.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wi-fi-7/\">Wi-Fi 7</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio\">Mac Studio (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237\">Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/apple-latest-m4-macs-lack-wi-fi-7-support/\">Unlike iPhone 16 Models, Apple's Newest Macs Lack Wi-Fi 7 Support</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/unlike-iphone-16-models-apples-newest-macs-lack-wi-fi-7-support.2452201/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f7de6c77a06ed28a0f6892054f150577f19fc2af7cf845c4bbfae3dc26d4524c","category":"Apple"}
