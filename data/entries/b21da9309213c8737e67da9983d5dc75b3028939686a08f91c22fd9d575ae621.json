The event boasted the most significant field size in its history. Four thousand riders took to the Flint Hills to tackle various course lengths; 25-mile, 50-mile, 100-mile, 200-mile, and 350-mile XL distances. Though the competition is always fierce at Unbound, the most formidable opponent for this year was the mud and lots of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Legan-winning-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Legan-winning--800x533.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Legan-winning--800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Legan-winning--297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Legan-winning--120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Legan-winning--768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Legan-winning--720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Legan-winning-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Photos: <a href=\"http://ec2-52-33-3-241.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/x/d?c=32261386&amp;l=90aabe1a-5f3a-4ba7-a0c9-f74dd2cf0942&amp;r=35c649ce-81d3-49ce-9870-c718f0c076ff\" target=\"_blank\">Garmin UNBOUND Gravel presented by Craft Sportswear</a>.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Let There Be Mud</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the flagship 200-miler event, the mud started around mile 11 and continued unrelentingly for several miles. The unrideable section caused riders to run, walk or shuffle — any way to keep momentum. Unfortunately for many — this muddy sector was as far as they would make it, with mechanicals a-plenty. For those that made it through the mud unscathed, the front groups were selective and filled with anxious riders, not letting anyone get up the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Womens-2002-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Womens-2002--800x534.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Womens-2002--800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Womens-2002--297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Womens-2002--120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Womens-2002--768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Womens-2002--720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Womens-2002-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Carolin Schiff of Bremen Germany, wins Unbound 200 with a finishing time of 11:46:39.

Unbound 2022 winner Sofia Gomez Villafane overtook Rinehart and gained about a minute by mile 40. Around mile 70, Carolin Schiff of Germany caught Villafane with Ruth Winder, Marisa Boaz, Sarah Sturm, and Alexis Skarda in pursuit. Schiff started to find her stride about halfway through, ultimately winning by more than 15 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Womens-200-close-up-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Womens-200-close-up--800x534.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Womens-200-close-up--800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Womens-200-close-up--297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Womens-200-close-up--120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Womens-200-close-up--768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Womens-200-close-up--720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Womens-200-close-up-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Carolin Schiff of Bremen, Germany, wins Unbound 200 </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I realized that I could maybe make it,” Schiff said at the winner’s press conference. “My team from Canyon was just pushing me at the aid station.

The group included Kiel Reijnen, Keegan Swenson, Howard Grotts, and Russell Finsterwald. Early on, Lachlan Morton and Ian Boswell pushed the pace to establish the gap further, disheartening any would-be chasers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Near the end of the race, the group was whittled down to seven. As the group approached Commercial Street, the riders began showing their cards. Keegan Swenson started his sprint early, beat out the chasing pack, and one-upped his second-place finish from 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Keegan-200-mile.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Keegan-200-mile-800x534.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Keegan-200-mile-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Keegan-200-mile-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Keegan-200-mile-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Keegan-200-mile-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Keegan-200-mile-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unbound-Keegan-200-mile.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Keegan Swenson of Park City, Utah wins Unbound Gravel, a 200 mile gravel race through the Flint Hills of Kansas, with a finish time of 10:06.4.
