Rather than using a physical button, Apple has instead opted for a hidden capacitive button.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/02/airpods-4-blue.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThe hidden button for pairing and resetting the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4/\">AirPods 4</a> is located at the front of the Charging Case, according to <em><a href=\"https://www.gearpatrol.com/audio/airpods-4-charging-case-hidden-button/\">Gear Patrol</a></em>. To initiate pairing mode, the ‌AirPods 4‌ Charging Case can be opened up and then double tapped at the front where the hidden control is located. This hidden button is also used for factory resetting, and <em>Gear Patrol</em> said that either a triple tap or long press and hold gesture initiates a reset.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe status light on the ‌AirPods 4‌ Charging Case is also more discreet. There is no obvious LED dot when the case is not charging or closed, and the light simply appears under the white plastic when the case is opened up or placed on a charger.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are two versions of the ‌AirPods 4‌, one with ANC and one without. Pricing starts at $129, and pre-orders are available now. The ‌AirPods 4‌ are set to launch on Friday, September 20.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 4</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/11/airpods-4-hidden-button/\">AirPods 4 Have Hidden Capacitive Button for Pairing</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-4-have-hidden-capacitive-button-for-pairing.2435937/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"96101819f21904996b7cfcf60d19cbf9776c2bca93425b7d174ff23e8fbad47a","category":"Apple"}
