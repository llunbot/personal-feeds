It’s that time of year when we start to look forward to the new year and wait with bated breath for the Tour Down Under to start in January.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With only two weeks left of 2024, let’s try to gaze into our crystal ball and see what to expect from every men’s WorldTour team. We’ll try and read between the lines of rider schedules, takeaways from the transfer market and rider aspirations to pin down who we think the best teams will be on WorldTour next year. Bear in mind, 2025 will also mark <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-rankings-promotions-and-relegations\" target=\"_blank\">the end of the current relegation cycle</a>, so some teams will be battling tooth and nail to remain within the top-division of pro cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of the 18 teams will receive a school exam-like grade based on their team roster for 2025. Plus, we will also put our necks on the line and make a bold prediction for every team, whether that be Tour de France glory or sixth place overall at Paris-Nice. Let’s get stuck in…</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Alpecin-Deceuninck</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2089243584-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2089243584-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2089243584-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2089243584-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2089243584-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2089243584-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2089243584-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2089243584-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2089243584-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2089243584-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2089243584-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Sara Cavallini/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Alpecin-Deceuninck won three of the five Monuments on offer in 2024. The Belgian team also scored success at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta a España</a> with sprint victories courtesy of Jasper Philipsen and Kaden Groves. Overall, they continued their successful streak in these domains, solidifying their place towards the top of the WorldTour hierarchy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mathieu-van-der-poel\" target=\"_blank\">Mathieu van der Poel</a>, a three-time winner of the<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-of-flanders\" target=\"_blank\"> Tour of Flanders</a>, will feel some more pressure in the cobbled Classics in 2025. Wout van Aert will be back in 2025 after spending the 2024 Classics campaign in recovery from a crash in Dwaars door Vlaanderen. On top of that, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a> has announced his return to Belgium with a programme that features E3 and the Tour of Flanders. Pogačar is one of just two riders to topple Van der Poel’s dynasty in that race, so that might make this objective harder to crack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/paris-roubaix\" target=\"_blank\">Paris-Roubaix</a>, Alpecin-Deceuninck have filled the top two slots on the podium over the past two years. This run of form may continue into 2025 and perhaps Jasper Philipsen will get his chance to lift the big cobblestone trophy in April. Philipsen, though, should keep his powder dry for the Tour de France. There, he could win the opening stage and slip into the<em> maillot jaune</em> before handing over leadership duties to Van der Poel for the rest of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\" target=\"_blank\">the race’s punchy opening week</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no big news to report in terms of transfers. The team will continue its successful run with a proven squad of rouleurs and lead-out men. It’s therefore hard to see them lose their grip in 2025, although cobble supremacy will be a bigger task in 2025 with more rivals in top form.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Prediction: Philipsen wins the green jersey and wins the first stage of the Tour</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Squad grade: B-</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+3\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-3-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-3-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-3-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-3-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-3-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-3-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-3-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-3-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Arkéa-B&amp;B Hotels</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"606\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/ARKEA-970x606.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/ARKEA-970x606.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/ARKEA-300x188.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/ARKEA-768x480.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/ARKEA-750x469.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/ARKEA-1140x713.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/ARKEA.png 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Arkéa-B&amp;B Hotels are in a sticky situation. They are currently in the drop zone<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-rankings-promotions-and-relegations\" target=\"_blank\"> with relegation looking like a real possibility</a> at the end of next season. It was widely reported that the team was struggling financially and they’ve lost some crucial riders in this year’s transfer market. Not even the squad’s classy new kit will save them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vincenzo Albanese, Clément Champoussin and David Dekker’s departures will leave some space to be filled in regards to capturing UCI points. This pressure will be passed onto the likes of Arnaud Démare and Luca Mozzato along with Kévin Vauquelin, who scored the team’s first Grand Tour stage at the Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Norman jack of all trades Vauquelin has had a mixed bag in the past few seasons. He’s sometimes in great form, then sometimes completely anonymous. He’ll be hoping to continue his typical early-season form in the spring stage races like Paris-Nice and its smaller southern French counterparts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the Grand Tours, I’m not quite so confident about Arkéa-B&amp;B’s chances. They lack a standout breakaway rider and they’re also void of a sprinter, climber or <em>puncheur </em>strong enough to outmuscle the field. Even two-time <em>maglia ciclamino</em> winner Démare is slowing down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s going to be another tough year for the Breton team and I’m not sure it’s going to have a happy ending.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Bold prediction: Vauquelin wins a WorldTour stage but the team gets relegated at the end of 2025</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Squad grade: D</h4>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n

their worst season to date in 2024. If it weren’t for Ineos, I’m sure more people would be talking about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something wasn’t quite right at the team this year. They missed the mark at the Grand Tours, failing to score a single stage win this year. The team only reached the podium of a WorldTour stage race on one occasion thanks to Pello Bilbao’s third place finish at the UAE Tour. For a team that has contended for Grand Tour glory and been at the forefront of Monuments, 2024 was a true <em>annus horribilis</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following on from this will be tough, but I think the team have the answers. Santiago Buitrago has shown some promise in stage races. He managed to bag a top ten finish at the Tour and he won a crafty stage at Paris-Nice. I reckon he’ll be a key player in the mountains next year, particularly in smaller races. I wouldn’t be against him searching out for a King of the Mountains jersey at a Grand Tour next year – perhaps the Tour de France. At the Tour, he will have to share the spotlight with young French signing Lenny Martinez. He has some real potential in the mountains and has demonstrated his willingness to attack while riding for his former team Groupama-FDJ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This leaves Antonio Tiberi and Pello Bilbao – the team’s two most proven Grand Tour riders. Tiberi landed a career-best finish at the Giro in 2024, winning Bahrain a white jersey at the <em>Corsa Rosa</em> in the process. He should make waves in 2025 with this added experience and another year of progression in the legs. I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s a key player once again at the Giro. Bilbao, however, is a bit of a wildcard. He can chase stages and go for the overall classification. He’s likely to secure some podiums at stage races along the way, but who’s to say whether he’ll guide the team to its lofty GC aspirations?</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Bold prediction: Antonio Tiberi becomes the team’s top points scorer and finishes in the top five of the Giro</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Squad grade: C+</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cofidis</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-41-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-41-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-41-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-41-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-41-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-41-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-41-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-41-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-41-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-41-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-41-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Cofidis Cycling</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cofidis have re-arranged the furniture ahead of 2025. They’ve unveiled a striking new ‘love it or hate it’ kit, switched to Campagnolo groupsets and made a couple of key signings while losing core personnel like perennial leader Guillaume Martin. These changes all come ahead of a season that will see them <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-rankings-promotions-and-relegations\" target=\"_blank\">battle it out for WorldTour survival against the likes of Picnic-PostNL, XDS Astana and Arkéa-B&amp;B Hotels</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The refreshed line-up includes consistent Spanish sprinter Alex Aranburu who they’ll be hoping to morph into a future Coupe de France titan. At those national races, the Basque rider could sweep the floor and score some big UCI points to hold off their relegation opposition. Likewise, Dylan Teuns, a former winner of La Flèche Wallonne, has been drafted in to support their Classics goals. Emu Buchmann has come to the French team to steady the GC ship in the absence of Martin, and Welsh-French Simon Carr will add a solid breakaway weapon to their armoury. Overall, these signings could prove cunning for a team that’s right on the edge of the UCI rankings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, Bryan Coquard has stuck with Cofidis after finally winning a WorldTour sprint with the team. He will also help to secure some crucial points in sprint finishes and one-day races. Similarly, Stanislaw Aniołkowski could help to attract more sprinting accolades after proving his worth at the Giro d’Italia in 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things might be on the up for Cofidis in 2025. There’s only one Izaguirre left (that’s Ion by the way), but they might just scrape their way through and remain on the WorldTour if these signings follow up on their promise.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Bold prediction: Alex Aranburu wins a heap of French races and becomes an honourary French citizen</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Squad grade: C (for Cofidis)</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Decathlon-2025-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Decathlon-2025-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Decathlon-2025-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Decathlon-2025-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Decathlon-2025-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Decathlon-2025-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Decathlon-2025-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Decathlon-2025-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Decathlon-2025-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Decathlon-2025-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Decathlon-2025.jpg 2048w\" /><figcaption>Decathlon-AG2R/Van Rysel</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If any team punched above their weight in 2024, it was <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/decathlon-ag2r\" target=\"_blank\">Decathlon-AG2R</a>. The French team finished the 2024 calendar in fifth place in the UCI rankings and they managed to sneak onto the Vuelta podium, win multiple Grand Tour stages and importantly act as one of the most aggressive teams in the pro peloton. Decathlon-AG2R will be looked upon next year as people wonder whether they can keep up this momentum for another twelve months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An architect of the squad’s success this year Ben O’Connor has left the team. This is a huge blow for the squad and will require the likes of Felix Gall and Aurélien Paret-Peintre to step up their game. The Austrian Gall struggled at times in 2024 to live up to the great expectations we had of him back at the 2023 Tour de France. I imagine that this sophomore slump will be corrected and Gall will return to his winning ways in 2025, with one eye on capturing podium finishes at WorldTour level stage races.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>O’Connor is not the only breakout rider to seek a future elsewhere. Alex Baudin, a stalwart of the Spring Classics in 2024, as well as Giro stage winner Valentin Paret-Peintre have jumped ship. These departures have made way for some exciting incomers like Giro Next Gen winner <br />Johannes Staune-Mittet and Swiss <em>rouleur </em>Stefan Bissegger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benoît Cosnefroy and Dorian Godon will anchor the team’s Classics ambitions. Cosnefroy can sometimes overthrow the likes of Pogačar and Van der Poel, but I’m not confident that he’ll be able to win a major WorldTour Classic in 2025, particularly given that Pogačar has announced his bullish ambitions to return to the Ardennes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’ll be tough to follow up their stellar 2024 season. The team have long-term ambitions and a crop of<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paul-seixas-interview\" target=\"_blank\"> talented youngsters </a>coming through. Next season might not be their most illustrious, but it’ll certainly be an important one in finding their path as they advance without O’Connor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Bold prediction: Felix Gall returns to winning ways on the Grand Tour stage</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Squad grade: B-</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>EF Education-EasyPost</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/666ef30914f27247649726-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/666ef30914f27247649726-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/666ef30914f27247649726-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/666ef30914f27247649726-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/666ef30914f27247649726-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/666ef30914f27247649726-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/666ef30914f27247649726-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/666ef30914f27247649726-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/666ef30914f27247649726-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/666ef30914f27247649726-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/666ef30914f27247649726-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Photo Sportida</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>EF have made some smart signings during this year’s transfer window. Kasper Asgreen is the headline name in terms of incomers. The former QuickStep rider has some strong pedigree in the cobbled Classics having won E3 and the Tour of Flanders back in 2021. He’s also finished on the podium of Strade Bianche in the past and outwitted the peloton at the Tour de France to take stage honours there. In EF pink, he’ll slot into the role of the departed Alberto Bettiol and I wouldn’t bet against Asgreen following in the footsteps of EF’s strong heritage in the cobbled Classics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex Baudin and Madis Mihkels add some glimmers of youthful optimism into the EF roster. These two have shown real promise in the Ardennes and cobbled Classics respectively. Mihkels is more of a sprinter so it’ll be interesting to see how he links up with the squad’s stripped-back leadout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben Healy will be hoping to continue his progress in one-days and stage races. After some strong escapee performances at the Olympic Games, World Championships and Tour de France, I believe he will continue to be a wildcard to keep your eyes on. That said, he has hinted at a potential GC bid in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of the Tour de France, we expect things to be led by reigning polka-dot jersey champion Richard Carapaz. The Ecuadorian is among the few riders in the peloton capable of following the so-called big four. That said, I hope the team decide to send him to the Giro and/or Vuelta so they can wedge their way onto the podium with more confidence and certainty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, the team are yet to reveal their jersey for the next season, so we’re left to impatiently wait for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-pro-jerseys-of-the-2020s-so-far\" target=\"_blank\">whatever concoction of pink </a>they have up their sleeves for the next twelve months.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Bold prediction: Ben Healy wins a Tour de France stage</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Squad grade: B</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>Groupama-FDJ</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Groupama-FDJ-970x648.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Groupama-FDJ-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Groupama-FDJ-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Groupama-FDJ-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Groupama-FDJ-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Groupama-FDJ-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Groupama-FDJ-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Groupama-FDJ-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Groupama-FDJ.jpg 1080w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Long-time fixtures in the WorldTour, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/groupama-fdj\" target=\"_blank\">Groupama-FDJ</a> have solidified their status as a mid-table team. They rarely slump, but they rarely score Grand Tour wins and Monument victories. In the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/thibaut-pinot\" target=\"_blank\">post-Pinot</a> era the team have been scrambling to find their new star, often leaning on Gaudu in the mountains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Breton hopeful Gaudu rode a surprisingly solid Vuelta after a fairly anonymous 2024 season up to that point. In 2025, though, he’ll be relied upon once more for Tour success. The pressure might be lessened given the arrival of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/from-philosophy-author-to-dauphine-podium-guillaume-martin-qa\" target=\"_blank\">Guillaume Martin</a>. Both riders are solid, but they don’t take big wins very often. They should become perennial figures in the top ten of stage races, but I doubt that Groupama-FDJ will change fortunes and become a podium contender for GC races like the Critérium du Dauphiné or the Tour de Suisse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team’s programmes have not been released yet. However, if Groupama-FDJ do one thing, they will throw all of their trusted personnel into the Tour de France. After Arkéa and TotalEnergies took stages at the Tour this summer, Groupama is now the French team suffering the longest Tour stage drought. In fact, they haven’t claimed a stage since the pandemic. A big goal of theirs, therefore, should be stage hunting. Saying that to Groupama, on the other hand, will be tough. They go into autopilot and focus on the GC each year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stefan Küng and Valentin Madouas should continue to feature heavily in the spring Classics, picking up some decent results there. The loss of Laurence Pithie will be felt in these races though. Maybe Paul Lapeira, the reigning French champion, will start to target cobbled Classics and live up to his hype as France’s next one-day hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Bold prediction: Guillaume Martin goes in a breakaway at the Tour and gains seven minutes only to lose that advantage two days later</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Squad grade: C+</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ineos Grenadiers</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Ineos-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Ineos-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Ineos-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Ineos-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Ineos-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Ineos-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Ineos-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Ineos-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Ineos-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Ineos-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Ineos-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Ineos Grenadiers</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s no secret that <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ineos-grenadiers\" target=\"_blank\">Ineos Grenadiers</a> have had a tough twelve months. The British team had its worst season during their 14-year history. That said, Ineos still wriggled their way onto the Giro podium thanks to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/geraint-thomas\" target=\"_blank\">Geraint Thomas</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tom-pidcock\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Pidcock</a> landed a big win at Amstel Gold. Speaking of Pidcock, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tom-pidcock-q36-5-pros-cons\" target=\"_blank\">the divorce was finally settled</a> between the Yorkshireman and the team at the beginning of December, meaning that they will need to find a new Classics man to help them succeed in the spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tour de France hopes rest once again on the shoulders of Carlos Rodríguez. The Spaniard will turn 24 in February and should be entering his prime. After a couple of formative seasons spent learning the ropes at the Tour and Vuelta, Rodríguez has it in him to reach the top five of the Tour de France as he did in 2023. It’ll be difficult to equal the pace of Vingegaard, Pogačar and Evenepoel, but Rodríguez sits firmly at the top of this second echelon of Grand Tour riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/egan-bernal\" target=\"_blank\">Egan Bernal </a>made some huge leaps forward in 2024. He reached the top ten on several occasions at one-week stage races, but his Tour performance left many underwhelmed. I’m not brave enough to say that the Colombian will be back at the pointy end of a Grand Tour in 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the other riders at Ineos, the team hasn’t signed a flagship rider in the winter. They will likely target similar races to 2025 with Geraint Thomas leading the squad at a Grand Tour – perhaps for the final time in his career. The team, however, do have plenty of young riders capable of making a big break if things line up in 2025. Axel Laurence could slip into the top ten of the Classics while Josh Tarling will start the Giro as a favourite for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/grand-tour-2025-route-rumours\" target=\"_blank\">the two or three time-trials on offer there</a> (depending on the route, which will be revealed in January).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’ll be a year of recalibration for Ineos Grenadiers. Some core staff members have left the squad, including Pidcock’s coach Kurt Bogaerts and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/steve-cummings-profile\" target=\"_blank\">former DS Steve Cummings</a>. It’s also crunch time for the host of young experiments brought into the team. If things don’t improve next season, we might be witnessing the true decline of this once-triumphant project.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Bold prediction: Carlos Rodríguez finishes in fifth place at the Tour de France</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Squad grade: B-</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>Intermarché-Wanty</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-2024-12-19T124133.776-970x647.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-2024-12-19T124133.776-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-2024-12-19T124133.776-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-2024-12-19T124133.776-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-2024-12-19T124133.776-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-2024-12-19T124133.776-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-2024-12-19T124133.776-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-2024-12-19T124133.776-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-2024-12-19T124133.776-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-2024-12-19T124133.776-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-2024-12-19T124133.776.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After their unexpected promotion to the WorldTour at the beginning of 2021, it’s been a sharp learning curve for Belgian team Intermarché-Wanty. Over the past four seasons, they’ve claimed wins at all three Grand Tours, won the green jersey and have safely positioned themselves inside the WorldTour, free from any relegation worries. It’s impressive, to say the least.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of those achievements were undertaken by Eritrean phenomenon <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/biniam-girmay-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Biniam Girmay.</a> He is expected to return to the Tour de France after his green jersey glory and three stage victories at the 2024 race. He will be anchored in the lead-out by some extra personnel, but the lack of Mike Teunissen could affect the success of this train. Girmay’s season won’t be solely focussed on the Tour either. He’ll come back to the Classics after a long bout of bad luck there over the past two seasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m going to go bold, however, and say that Alexander Kamp revitalises his career at Intermarché after signing for the team this winter. The Dane has a real chance to pop up in the top ten of WorldTour races and he might even be able to return to the WorldTour podium at a race like Eschborn Frankfurt or the Amstel Gold Race. Likewise, he might be a man to watch at smaller Belgian and Dutch one-day races such as the Volta a Limburg or the Grand Prix Wallonie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next year could also see the arrival of Gerben Thijssenn on the WorldTour level. Often able to beat the best sprinters around at smaller one-day races in Benelux, the Belgian should aim to translate this success onto the WorldTour stage. Until now, he’s suffered a lot of bad luck that has prevented him from really showing us what he’s capable of there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Bold prediction: Alexander Kamp becomes one of the team’s top UCI points scorers</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Squad grade: B-</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lidl-Trek</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-2025-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-2025-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-2025-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-2025-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-2025-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-2025-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-2025-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-2025-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-2025-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-2025-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-2025.jpg 1600w\" /><figcaption>Trek</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lidl-trek\" target=\"_blank\">Lidl-Trek</a> is a team packed with big names and personalities. They’ve made some major changes over the past two seasons, not only in terms of their name but also the expertise they have on board. Notably, Jonathan Milan has stepped up to the plate and continued his progression towards becoming one of the best sprinters in the world. After winning a bunch of top-level sprints in 2024, the tall Italian could easily jump onto the Tour de France and win a stage or two. Otherwise, I expect him to be the fastest sprinter at whatever Grand Tour he chooses and equally at high-level WorldTour stage races.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside Milan, Mads Pedersen will be aiming high in 2025. The Dane has emerged as one of the best one-day racers in recent years and he shouldn’t be afraid to target Monuments like Milan-San Remo, the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix. Pedersen will also be flanked by newly recruited countryman Søren Kragh Andersen next year. This combo has the potential to be very successful if they manage to develop a secret formula to toppling Van Aert and Van der Poel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next year could be pivotal for Thibau Nys as well. The young Belgian has been enjoying a strong cyclocross calendar and he is expected to make a serious step up on the road in 2025 after claiming a couple of WorldTour stages in 2024. Nys is rumoured to be on one of the team’s Grand Tour rosters next year with many tipping him for a Tour de France debut. Wherever he goes, expect him to leave his mark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of Grand Tours, their potential GC success might not be as rosy as their one-day and sprinting aspirations seem. Their recent signings don’t exactly support their chances in the mountains and it seems as though the emphasis is moving towards Classics rather than the overall aspirations of Giulio Ciccone and Tao Geoghegan Hart. That said, they still have the chance to win from the breakaway with the likes of Patrik Konrad and Carlos Verona nestled quietly within their set-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Bold prediction: Jonathan Milan will become the ‘king of the sprints’ in 2025</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Squad grade: B+</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>Movistar</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Movistar-2025-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Movistar-2025-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Movistar-2025-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Movistar-2025-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Movistar-2025-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Movistar-2025-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Movistar-2025-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Movistar-2025-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Movistar-2025-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Movistar-2025-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Movistar-2025-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Movistar Team/Gobik</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After a season spent with just one WorldTour win to their name – Pelayo Sánchez at the Giro – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/movistar\" target=\"_blank\">Movistar </a>will be trying to tussle their way back into the top echelons of GC once more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Movistar will be resting upon their Enric Mas laurels again next year. The Spaniard is rumoured to be reprising his familiar schedule of a Tour-Vuelta double with some late-season Classics in the mix. This has worked out for him in recent years, particularly at the Vuelta. Although he’s not the most visible rider out there, Mas has finished on the podium of the Vuelta on three occasions since 2021. Only a fool would bet against history repeating itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of Mas’s chances, he’ll be supported by Vuelta breakout star Pablo Castrillo. The Spaniard was the subject of a tightly fought transfer race between Movistar and Ineos in the autumn, with Movistar hoping to shape him into a GC rider. This could work out at one-week stage races, but I’m doubtful when it comes to Grand Tours. On the other hand, his talent could come in handy when it comes to supporting Mas as a domestique in the Vuelta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless something drastically changes, GC will be the squad’s main focus. After losing its best Classics cards in the form of Matteo Jorgenson, Oier Lazkano and Alex Aranburu, the team has been thinned out to its climbing core. Don’t forget about<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/nairo-quintana\" target=\"_blank\"> Nairo Quintana</a>. Could he roll back the clock in 2025 to his better days? I hold my reservations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Bold prediction: Enric Mas podiums the Vuelta (shock)</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Squad grade: B</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2411\" height=\"1606\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Red-Bull-2025-edited-2.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Red-Bull-2025-edited-2.webp 2411w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Red-Bull-2025-edited-2-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Red-Bull-2025-edited-2-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Red-Bull-2025-edited-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Red-Bull-2025-edited-2-1536x1023.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Red-Bull-2025-edited-2-2048x1364.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Red-Bull-2025-edited-2-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Red-Bull-2025-edited-2-1140x759.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Red-Bull-2025-edited-2-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Red-Bull-2025-edited-2-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Red-Bull-2025-edited-2-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe/Specialized</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/red-bull-bora-hansgrohe\" target=\"_blank\">Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe</a> have been one of the most active teams in the transfer market. In bagging some of the proven young talents on the top-flight, the German team are hoping to improve on their mixed 2024 season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now though, the German squad’s Grand Tour hopes will be underpinned by <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\">Primož Roglič</a>. The Slovenian’s schedule has already been revealed at his winter camp. There, Roglič has expressed his desire to target both the Tour de France and the Giro d’Italia, a race he won back in 2023 after a dramatic victory against the clock at Monte Lussari. 2022 winner Jai Hindley is expected to make a return to the Giro as part of a ferocious line-up that also includes this year’s runner-up Dani Martínez. This trident alone should strike fear into anyone hoping to challenge Roglič to the Giro crown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Classics, however, will see a major change of face for Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe. The signings of Laurence Pithie, Oier Lazkano, the Van Dijke twins and late-season addition Maxim Van Gils should turn the tide for them in the spring. Van Gils was everywhere in the Classics this season and with a stronger contingent around him at his new team, he should be able to translate this talent into a big win somewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After some teething problems with the bulked-up roster in 2024, the team looks to be going ahead with bold yet well-structured ambitions. This team has one of the best line-ups in the WorldTour and I wouldn’t be surprised if they slip into the top three of the UCI rankings this time next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Bold prediction: Roglič wins the Giro d’Italia</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Squad grade: A</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>Soudal-QuickStep</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-39-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-39-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-39-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-39-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-39-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-39-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-39-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-39-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-39-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-39.jpg 1440w\" /><figcaption>Wout Beel/Soudal Quick-Step</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Soudal-QuickStep have undergone a big switch up in recent years. The squad have transitioned away from one-day races and have now morphed into a GC squad capable of reaching Grand Tour podiums. This was proven in 2024 with three top ten finishes at three-week races.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel</a> will spend his Christmas period in recovery after suffering a crash in Belgium. This will hamper his appearances at team training camps, which could hinder his chances once the season kicks off in February. That said, this is Remco Evenepoel and he’s been here before. He’ll be sure to bounce back in time to target some of the Ardennes Classics and his major goal for 2025 – returning to the podium of the Tour de France. The Belgian should be eyeing up a Remco-friendly opening week to the Tour. There, the double time-trial world champion should sneak into the yellow jersey after Stage 5’s race of truth in Caen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Evenepoel’s right-hand man in 2024 Mikel Landa will ride a different programme in 2025. He’ll target early-season stage races before making his debut at Strade Bianche. The Basque rider hasn’t targeted this kind of Classic before, so it’ll be interesting to see how he gets on. This switch in role could coincide with the departure of former Strade Bianche podium finishers Julian Alaphilippe and Kasper Asgreen who have both left the team this winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the sprints, the team is in a fine place. Tim Merlier will surely continue his run as one of the most reliable fastmen in the pack. His lead-out train hasn’t been compromised in this GC makeover, so expect him to be lifting his arms in victory all year long.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Bold prediction: Evenepoel returns to the Tour de France podium.

Not only have they signed a whole new fleet of riders, from Grand Tour podium finishers to Olympic medallists, they underwent a visual transformation, swapping their blue and orange jersey for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/maap-jayco-alula\" target=\"_blank\">a Southern Lights-inspired indigo</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jayco’s biggest coup in the transfer market came with the signing of 2024 standout rider Ben O’Connor. The Perth native will be the team’s new GC leader after the departure of long-term number one <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/simon-yates\" target=\"_blank\">Simon Yates</a>, who left for Visma-Lease a Bike. O’Connor, the runner-up at this year’s Vuelta, will be shipped to the Tour de France with the aim of reaching the top five in GC. The Australian should be able to reach the podium at one-week stage races such as Paris-Nice or the Critérium du Dauphiné in 2025, but a Tour podium might be a stretch. His notable step up this season should give him confidence and I believe the new environment at Jayco-AlUla will spur him onto greater things in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To support him, the team has roped in a rigid set of climbers, including former Giro King of the Mountains Koen Bouwman and Patrick Gamper from Red Bull-Bora-Hangrohe. Together, this should harden the team’s squad in the mountains. Chris Harper has stuck with the team, so his role will be influential for O’Connor’s GC targets. The two are the same age and hail from the same country so I’m almost certain that their paths have crossed and they’ll be eager to kick start their new partnership in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the team’s sprinters Michael Matthews and Dylan Groenwegen, I expect them continue their steady progress. Groenwegen has it in him to win more Grand Tour stages in Jayco colours. Matthews is reliable and enjoyed a fruitful 2024 season. There’s nothing to say that this won’t continue into 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Bold prediction: O’Connor podiums Paris-Nice (or Tirreno-Adriatico)</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Squad grade: B+</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>Team Picnic-PostNL</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Degenkolb-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Degenkolb-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Degenkolb-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Degenkolb-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Degenkolb-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Degenkolb-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Degenkolb-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Degenkolb-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Degenkolb-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Degenkolb-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Degenkolb-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>dsm-firmenich PostNL</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Formerly the team with the longest string of title sponsors, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/dsm-firmenich-postnl\" target=\"_blank\">Team DSM-Firmenich-PostNL</a> will be called Team Picnic-PostNL next year. 2025 will be no walk in the park for the Dutch team though, there are plenty of questions to be answered after a turbulent 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Romain Bardet will retire in June following his home race the Critérium du Dauphiné. Similarly, Patrick Bevin has bowed out and John Degenkolb isn’t showing any signs of reaching the Paris-Roubaix podium once more. Fabio Jakobsen’s move to the team proved uneventful in 2024 with no WorldTour sprint wins to his name. No lead-out men have been drafted in to change that trajectory in 2025 either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, I think it’s going to fall upon the British young guns of Max Poole and Oscar Onley to lead Picnic-PostNL’s chances at the WorldTour level next season. Onley showed some real signs of strength last year, particularly in stage races. I expect him to make a step up and make the podium of a race like the Tour de Suisse or Tour de Romandie in 2025. Similarly, 22-year-old Tobias Lund Andresen has the capability to emerge as the team’s most successful fastman in 2025 if Jakobsen continues to miss the mark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the Classics, Picnic-PostNL might struggle. The squad’s one-day talent is getting on and the fresher talents on offer haven’t quite shown any signs of reaching their best level yet. This might prove to be a big vacuum in terms of UCI points in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Picnic-PostNL are close to the relegation zone. They should manage to avoid this fate, but if 2025 goes topsy turvy, then expect the Dutch team to enter those conversations, particularly if Cofidis comes out blazing in 2025 courtesy of their flood of new points-scoring recruits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Bold prediction: Oscar Onley lands a top ten finish at a Grand Tour</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Squad grade: C-</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>Team Visma-Lease a Bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-39-970x647.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-39-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-39-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-39-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-39-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-39-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-39-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-39-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-39-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-39-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-39.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>2024 didn’t exactly go to plan for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/visma-lease-a-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Visma-Lease a Bike</a>. Hot off their trinity of Grand Tour wins in 2023, the squad suffered a spell of bad luck that saw the team’s two stars <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/wout-van-aert\" target=\"_blank\">Wout van Aert </a>and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jonas-vingegaard\" target=\"_blank\">Jonas Vingegaard</a> require a long recovery period after heavy crashes in the spring. As a result, the Dutch team failed to score any Grand Tour victories for the first time since 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2025 should be a restart for the yellow-branded squad. They have brought in domestique de luxe and former Vuelta winner Simon Yates to support the squad’s Grand Tour ambitions. The British rider should slot into this role well, much like his brother at UAE Team Emirates. Yates will also be handed leadership opportunities in one-week stage races, a format I expect him to thrive in during the 2025 season. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Extra reinforcements are coming courtesy of Victor Campenaerts and Alex Zingle. These additions will be welcome for Vingegaard and Van Aert. Campenaerts, in particular, could prove a pivotal role in the cobbled Classics. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for Vingegaard’s chances in 2025 it’s fairly up in the air. He’ll have to face Pogačar once again at the Tour and it is currently uncertain whether the he’ll be sent to the Giro or Vuelta next year. Initial rumours circulated surrounding a bid at Giro glory, but these have been squashed in recent weeks. In all honesty, though, I expect Vingegaard to replicate his now typical schedule of the O Gran Camiño, Itzulia Basque Country and the Critérium du Dauphiné. If he follows this programme, he should come out of 2025 with at least one major stage-race victory. Another Tour victory might be a step too far given the strength of his Slovenian competitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the day, it’s Visma and they should win a convincing tally of races and reach the Grand Tour podium at least once. They’ll no doubt feature on a Monument podium too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Bold prediction: Simon Yates wins a major one-week stage race and Vingegaard scores another podium finish at the Tour</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Squad grade: A</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>UAE Team Emirates-XRG</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-40-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-40-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-40-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-40-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-40-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-40-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-40-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-40-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-40-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-40-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-40-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>UAE Team Emirates </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\">UAE Team Emirates</a> have a new title sponsor for 2025: XRG. The new backer isn’t exactly new, it’s the international investment off-shot of UAE’s state-owned oil company. Perhaps this explains the oil spill aesthetic of their 2025 team kit which features a smoky black effect on the sleeves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After their chart-topping 2024 campaign, the squad remain just as ambitious in 2025. The team leader <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar </a>will target two Grand Tours next year, we assume the Tour and Vuelta. Elsewhere, Juan Ayuso will be the team’s leader at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia</a>. This should answer some of the questions surrounding his future GC chances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pogačar’s expectant Tour team has also been unveiled at the squad’s training camp, which took place last week in Spain. There, the reigning champion will be flanked by the same squad as last year but with the addition of Giro stage winner and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-transfers-2025-winners-and-losers\" target=\"_blank\">new recruit Jhonatan Narváez</a>. As the saying goes: if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. This line-up will once again include the supporting riders of João Almeida and Adam Yates, which proved to be a winning combo last summer. Almeida, in particular, shared a willingness to support the reigning champion at next year’s <em>Grande Boucle</em>, which points towards an improved team cohesion at next year’s race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the Spring Classics, the aforementioned Narváez adds an extra weapon to the squad’s vast arsenal. New signing Florian Vermeersch will also play a key role in helping Pogačar achieve another Tour of Flanders victory, a feat the Slovenian hopes to replicate in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>UAE Team Emirates are still the best team in the WorldTour on paper. I wouldn’t bet against them getting the top spot in the UCI rankings once again in 2025. Pogačar’s schedule should unsettle any of his competitors as he eyes up an ambitious programme of Classics ahead of his Tour bid in July.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Bold prediction: Pogačar wins the Tour de France and the Vuelta a Espana, completing his trident of Grand Tour victories</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Squad grade: A+</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>XDS-Astana</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-42-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-42-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-42-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-42-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-42-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-42-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-42-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-42-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/file-42.jpg 1080w\" /><figcaption>XDS Astana</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Astana Qazaqstan have dropped the country’s name from their title and have become XDS-Astana. We believe the team will still race under a Kazakh flag next year, but the team will be backed by a new Chinese sponsor: XDS. With this, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mark-cavendish\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Cavendish’s</a> former home will swap Wilier bikes for a little-known company X-Lab for 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with these sponsorship changes, much of the roster has changed too – roughly half of it. Along with Cavendish’s departure, Astana have lost many of their young Kazakh riders and Astana’s former poster boy Alexey Lutsenko. Team principal Alexander Vinokourov has counterbalanced this with an impressive list of signings that include Giro stage winner Diego Ulissi, Tour of Flanders champion Alberto Bettiol, Tour stage victor Wout Poels, <em>puncheur </em>Clément Champoussin and Vuelta stage winner Sergio Higuita to name a few. In all honesty, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-transfers-2025-winners-and-losers\" target=\"_blank\">XDS-Astana have become one of the most well-rounded WorldTour teams</a> after just one transfer season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this heavy list of newcomers, XDS-Astana face an uphill battle to stay in the WorldTour. Even if they win all three Grand Tour next year, the maths is still stacked against them after two meagre years spent chasing Cavendish’s record-breaking 35th stage win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this shouldn’t detract the team from making some improvements in 2025 in terms of their results. I expect the team to poach a number of breakaway stages at WorldTour races thanks to the experience of Wout Poels and Sergio Higuita. Alberto Bettiol and Mike Teunissen will inevitably pop up in the Classics while Cees Bol, Max Kanter and Gleb Syritsa continue their journey towards the top level of sprinting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t expect Astana to fight for Grand Tour victories next year, but it should certainly be an improvement on the past two years of quiet results from this old-time favourite of the pro peloton.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Bold prediction: Astana enjoy their best season since 2020 and X-Lab bike sales skyrocket</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Squad grade: B</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mens-worldtour-preview-2025\">What to expect from every men’s WorldTour team in 2025</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"152277c3c1ee6a20303abd01943b5c4305ac7486b0e2c5a9f6c721cabf5a1564","category":"Cycling"}
