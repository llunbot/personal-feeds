The typeface is one\neveryone has seen, so it would be quietly familiar, even timeless.\nBut it has enough expressive components that it could live in many\ncontexts. Just as great of an appeal was the historical context of\nJohn Baskerville himself.</p>\n\n<p>“John Baskerville as a person, as a craftsperson, was uncannily\nsimilar in his obsessiveness and his character to those of us at\nLoveFrom,” Ive says. “And that really, in a very natural way,\nbecame the starting point for developing our own typeface.”</p>\n\n<p>Baskerville was indeed obsessive, Cavedoni explains. As we wrote\nin our story on the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90693444/jony-ives-first-major-design-since-leaving-apple-isnt-what-youd-expect\">Terra Carta</a>, Baskerville first made\nhis money in “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanning\">japanned</a>” lacquerwork items. As he reached\nhis 40s, he had the resources to go heads-down on his passion for\nword-making. As a trained calligrapher, he wanted to elevate the\nquality of book printing. He obsessed over not just the design of\nhis typeface Baskerville but of the crafted execution of the\nindividual metal “punches” that pressed each letter to ensure the\nprinting was sharp. He even <a href=\"https://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1761.htm\">formulated</a> an improved ink,\nand learned he could place woven paper into hot brass cylinders to\ngive it a glossy finish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A type designer who veered into innovations in ink formulation and paper finishing — yes, that sounds like a kindred spirit to Ive and his colleagues.</p>\n\n<p>The entirety of Steve Jobs’s <em>Make Something Wonderful</em> — both on the web and in the limited print editions — is, unsurprisingly, typeset in LoveFrom. Before that, I’d only encountered LoveFrom Serif in small doses, and typically at display sizes (like <a href=\"https://www.lovefrom.com/\">the LoveFrom website’s home page</a>). Turns out it’s quite good — traditional but distinctive — as a long-form text face. Broadly speaking, most people perceive serif fonts as more formal, sans serifs more casual. LoveFrom Serif feels like a friendly, emotionally warm serif, but which cedes no ground on formality and structure. British, for sure, but somehow with a welcome whiff of California. It’s clearly derived from Baskerville, but evokes a different feel, particularly at text sizes, than the eponymous Baskerville  <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/fonts/system-fonts/\">that ships</a> on Apple platforms.</p>\n\n<p>Cavedoni presented a lecture just this week entitled “<a href=\"https://letterformarchive.org/shop/unexpected-baskerville-the-story-of-lovefrom-serif/\">Unexpected Baskerville: The Story of LoveFrom Serif</a>”, at San Francisco’s Main Public Library. It pains me to have missed <a href=\"https://typo.social/@typographica/110630124570983807\">what appears</a> to have been a remarkable presentation, with noteworthy guests and historic books, but a video recording is forthcoming “later this year”.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Postscript:</strong> I’ve been sitting on this link for a few weeks, partly because, well, I do that, but also because I wanted to let the experience of having read <em>Make Something Wonderful</em> settle in. That book, to me, is LoveFrom Serif’s true debut. If you want to exercise a typeface, set a book in it. It has occurred to me several times during this stretch how much <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2018/01/dean_allen\">I miss Dean Allen</a>, and specifically, herewith, I crave his thoughts on both the typeface and the book. Re-reading for the umpteenth time <em><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111103090824/http://www.textism.com/textfaces/index.html?id=7\">Twenty Faces</a></em>, Dean’s remarkably <a href=\"https://twitter.com/verbosus/status/954452524379131904\">concise and compelling</a> “survey of available text typefaces”, I was reminded that his entry on ITC Baskerville points also to <a href=\"https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Mrs-Eaves\">Mrs Eaves</a>, Zuzana Licko’s inspired 1996 revival (has it been that long? I will forever think of Mrs Eaves as a “new” typeface), which Dean described thus: “an interesting if mannered experiment in reviving Baskerville by aping the unpredictability of form found in letterpress text.”</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/29/lovefrom-serif\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ee92baf201df539304c8ce37a00aac65943a30f59a286c45876caadee85fe377","category":"Tech"}
