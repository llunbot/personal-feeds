It features an all-new triple-wide floating shelf that ensures every chain is securely fixtured and centered during use: no more missed punches or misaligned chains. The ergonomic handle stores spare driving pins as well as a peening anvil used for peening Campagnolo® 11, 12, and 13-speed chains. Best of all, it’s rugged and durable enough for daily use and is fully rebuildable.</p>\n<p><img width=\"900\" height=\"780\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/CT-15_0424_021.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/CT-15_0424_021.jpg?w=900&amp;quality=75 900w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/CT-15_0424_021.jpg?resize=768,666&amp;quality=75 768w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"780\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/CT-15_0424_033.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/CT-15_0424_033.jpg?w=900&amp;quality=75 900w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/CT-15_0424_033.jpg?resize=768,666&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compatible with single-speed bicycle chains including 1/8”, 3/16” and half-link</li>\n<li>Compatible with all 5 to 13-speed derailleur chains, including SRAM® 12-speed Flattop™, SRAM® 12-speed T-Type™,</li>\n<li>Shimano® 12-speed XTR™ and Campagnolo® 13-steed Ekar™.</li>\n<li>Includes removable anvil for peening Campagnolo® 11 to 13-speed chains</li>\n<li>Includes two spare driving pins</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.parktool.com/en-us/product/professional-chain-tool-ct-15?category=New+Products\" target=\"_blank\">Park Tool</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/park-tool-ct-15-chain-tool/\">Park Tool CT-15 Professional Chain Tool</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"689a1da424e644969fe73b65d2f3a3e0106fb1dc49f75b09bf20a74a8aeab5ee","category":"Cycling"}
