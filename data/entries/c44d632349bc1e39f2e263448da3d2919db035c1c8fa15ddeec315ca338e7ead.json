This year at the Japan Mobility Show, though, Toyota called its entire booth a concept. The concept was \"Find Your Future,\" and it was meant to show how electric vehicles can be fun and flexible in ways that internal combustion vehicles can't.</p>\n<p>Toyota also highlighted an internal combustion vehicle that offers even more flexibility than its concepts. One will go on sale in Asia in the next few months, while the others may never see pavement.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jms_toyota_04-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"The FT-Se is very orange.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jms_toyota_04-980x653.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jms_toyota_04-scaled.jpg\">The FT-Se is very orange.</a> (credit: Toyota )</p></div>\n<p>The highlight was a sharp-looking electric sports car concept called the FT-Se.
