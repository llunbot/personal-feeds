The September iPhone launch and the March/April spring event (which didn’t happen in 2023) seem almost unpredictable by comparison.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we list the major announcements (and some of the smaller titbits) you can expect to hear about at WWDC 2024. Some of these–updates to the five big Apple operating systems, most obviously–are as predictable as the timing of the event. But we reckon Apple will spring a few surprises this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has announced that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2280024/apples-worldwide-developers-conference-is-coming-june-10-14.html\">WWDC24 will be held from June 10-14</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When is WWDC 2024?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will kick off WWDC24 with a keynote at 10am Pacific Time on June 10, and the event for developers continues through June 14.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the dates from the past few years: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>WWDC 2023: June 5-9</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2022: June 6-10</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2021: June 7-11</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2020: June 22-26</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2019: June 3-7</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2018: June 4-8</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What time does WWDC 2024 start?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The keynote event will start at 10 a.m. in California. If you are wondering what time will the WWDC keynote start where you are it translates to: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>US: at 10 a.m. (PDT), 11 a.m. (MDT), noon (CDT), 1 p.m. (EDT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Canada: at 2 p.m. (ADT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>UK: at 6 p.m. (BST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Europe: at 7 p.m. (CEST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>India: at 10.30 p.m. (IST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Singapore and China: next day at 1 a.m.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japan: next day at 2 a.m. (JST) </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Australia: next day at 1 a.m. (AWST), 2.30 a.m. (ACST), 3 a.m. (AEST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New Zealand: next day at 5 a.m. (NZST)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to watch WWDC 2024</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When WWDC starts Apple will live stream the opening keynote on its website and elsewhere, including on YouTube and on the Apple TV app. This means you’ll be able to watch the presentation on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and even PC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the WWDC keynote video from 2023:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What will Apple announce at WWDC 2024?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WWDC stands for the Worldwide Developers Conference and is dedicated to the third-party software and hardware developers that create apps and accessories for Apple’s platforms: iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and now <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-vision-pro-release-date-headset-specs-price.html\">Vision Pro</a>. If you are a developer we have more information about getting an invite below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While devs are at the heart of the event, it’s also a press event that Apple uses to announce its software plans and potentially some new Macs and other products to the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on to find out what we expect to see Apple unveil at the event, from software and hardware to some entirely new products.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wwdc23-keynote-logo.gif?w=1200\" alt=\"Apple WWDC 2023 keynpte logo\" width=\"1200\" height=\"710\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Apple WWDC 2023 keynpte logo\" width=\"1200\" height=\"710\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Apple WWDC 2023 keynpte logo\" width=\"1200\" height=\"710\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>WWDC 2024: Software releases</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WWDC is all about the software, so we can be certain that Apple will reveal details of its upcoming operating system updates for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, HomePod, and Apple Watch. Those updates will then be issued to developers as a beta to test, and then a few weeks later a public beta will start. Eventually, the new software will be available for everyone to download in the fall (usually September for iOS/iPadOS/watchOS and October for macOS, although in 2023 <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1670742/macos-14-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">macOS Sonoma</a> arrived in September). Here’s what to expect: </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iOS 18</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The headliner of the event simply because of the sheer number of iPhone owners across the planet. If you’ve got an iPhone made within the past five years, you’ll likely be able to install the new version of iOS when it’s released in the fall of 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-ai-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">rumors we’ve heard about iOS 18</a> so far indicate that it could be one of the biggest iOS update ever. You can expect AI-specific features, including Generative-AI updates to Siri, Pages, Numbers and Keynote. RCS support is also said to be coming to iPhones in that time frame. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before then, there’s a whole beta-testing cycle to get through. iOS 18 will be announced at WWDC 2024, then released as a developer beta (for registered app developers only) almost immediately after the keynote. Developers will then be able to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671198/how-to-install-ios-beta.html\">install the iOS beta</a> and a few weeks later a public beta version will be made available for all users who want to try the new features. Our advice is to be cautious and prepared for serious flaws with the beta software–it might even brick your device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of the next few months, the developer and public betas will go through a testing process where features will be tweaked, changed, fixed, and updated until we reach the finished iOS 18.0 public release, most likely in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read all the rumors and our hopes for iOS 18 in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-ai-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18 guide.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPadOS 18</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The accompanying update for iPad owners, iPadOS 18 is likely to incorporate most of the new features of iOS 18, but adapted to a larger-screen interface. When Apple’s two mobile operating systems split in 2019 they were similar in most respects, but the iPad version is heading steadily into its own realm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, Apple released iPad OS 16 a month after iOS 16, so it’s possible that the two versions don’t arrive at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>macOS 15</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s Apple got in store for its follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1670742/macos-14-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">macOS Sonoma</a>? We’ll find out at WWDC 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This version will be numbered macOS 15, but what is less predictable is the California landmark Apple will name the version after. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672681/list-of-all-macos-versions-including-the-latest-macos.html\">So far</a> we’ve had: Mavericks, Yosemite, El Capitan, Sierra, High Sierra, Mojave, Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura and Sonoma. Based on the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1795091/macos-14-name-skyline-rincon-ios-ipados-features.html\">trademarks Apple has applied for</a>, macOS Rincon or Skyline could be likely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll share all the rumors and our hopes for macOS 15 in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS 15 guide</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>visionOS 2</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the Vision Pro is on sale you can expect to hear about new software features coming to the device at WWDC. Apple is likely to have things to say about new apps being made for the device as well as third-party software that is being created for Vision Pro. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>watchOS 11</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new operating system for the Apple Watch will be revealed at WWDC 2024. This is more of a niche than the iPhone, iPad, and Mac updates discussed above but could bring more health and fitness features to Apple Watch owners around the world. Expect AT to have an impact here as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>tvOS 18</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The lowest-profile of the big Apple operating systems, tvOS is the platform that runs on the Apple TV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What will we get this year? You’ll find out at WWDC.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>HomePod software version 18</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is also likely to update the software on the HomePod and HomePod mini alongside the other operating systems. In 2022 Apple introduced HomePod Software Version 16 which didn’t bring a lot of new features at the time, but a later update: HomePod Software Version 16.3 brought temperature and humidity sensing to the HomePod mini and more. We may hear more about Apple’s plans for the HomePod during the WWDC event–especially as Apple is rumored to planning big <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">changes to the HomePod</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Other software </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also expect Apple to update its developer-focused apps, like Swift, Xcode and TestFlight. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wwdc-swift.gif?w=1200\" alt=\"WWDC 2023 swift logo\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption>Apple displayed this special Swift logo on its WWDC 2023 website.</figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"WWDC 2023 swift logo\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>Apple displayed this special Swift logo on its WWDC 2023 website.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"WWDC 2023 swift logo\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>Apple displayed this special Swift logo on its WWDC 2023 website.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>WWDC 2024: Hardware releases</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WWDC tends to be a software-focused event, but Apple has often found time during its WWDC keynotes to launch hardware products too. The first few iPhone revisions—iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, and iPhone 4S—were all released at WWDC, and the HomePod had its unveiling at the event in 2017 as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the event has focused on Mac releases in recent years. Apple unveiled the iMac Pro in 2017 alongside updates to the iMac, MacBook, and MacBook Pro, and announced a new Mac Pro and the Pro Display XDR in June 2019. At WWDC 2020, Apple announced the transition from Intel to Apple silicon, and WWDC 2022 saw Apple launch the M2 chip in the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. WWDC 2023 saw Apple introduce the Vision Pro, 15-inch MacBook Air, and the Mac Studio and Mac Pro with M2 Ultra chip. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s in the hardware pipeline for Apple right now? There are plenty of WWDC rumors, but what’s really coming? Here’s what we hope to see: </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Vision Pro </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vision Pro launched in the U.S. in February, but it’s still not available elsewhere in the world. We expect Apple to announce availability for the U.K., Europe, Canada and Australia at WWDC in June. Frankly, if Apple doesn’t start selling the device outside the U.S. soon, it is going to look like a flop.

Expect the M3 Ultra to arrive at this event. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mac Pro </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, including in 2023, new Mac Pro models have launched at WWDC and this year could be no different. We expect to see the Mac Pro gain the M3 Ultra processor at WWDC in June. Read <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2320613/m3-m4-ultra-mac-pro-everything-you-need-to-know.html\">what we know about the 2024 Mac Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mac Studio</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If we see the M3 Ultra in the Mac Pro we will also see it in the Mac Studio. The Mac Studio will also get an M3 Max option. Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2204696/m3-mac-studio-design-processor-specs-price.html\">Mac Studio M3 Max and Ultra rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mac mini </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the iMac and MacBook Air have an M3 chip, and the MacBook Pro an M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max chip, it is surely only a matter of time before those same chips make their way into the Mac mini. Read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2109165/m3-mac-mini-design-processor-specs-release-rumors.html\">new Mac mini rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iMac </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For some time there have been rumors that the iMac Pro will make a return, in the form of a M3 Pro and possibly M3 Max version of Apple’s all-in-one. This could make an appearance at WWDC 2024, but rumors do seem to suggest we could be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1795989/oled-display-ipad-macbook-32-42-inch-imac.html\">waiting a little longer</a> for this larger iMac. Read the rumors about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">Apple’s plans for the iMac Pro</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to attend WWDC</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to attend the WWDC Keynote in person you need to be prepared to enter a lottery and apply for a ticket alongside other developers. There is a lot of competition for those tickets, which are randomly selected from those to apply and aren’t transferable. The good news is that tickets are free. The bad news is they have already been allocated for 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple invites developers to participate in a series of classes, workshops, and sessions to learn about the system-wide changes coming to the major software platforms in the coming year so they can update their apps. Some lucky developers even get to watch the event live in person. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be in with a chance of attending WWDC 2024 you needed to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/special-event/request/&amp;xcust=1-1-678333-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Request to attend</a> on the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/&amp;xcust=1-1-678333-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Developer website</a>. The deadline to request to attend the event has now passed though.  It was open to the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Current Apple Developer Program members.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Entrepreneur Camp alumni.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Swift Student Challenge winners – 2024 challenge applicants will be included in a separate random selection process for winners (in early May 2023 Apple began alerting the lucky few of their status as winners). </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Current Apple Developer Enterprise Program members.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The lucky applicants were notified of their success in getting a ticket at the beginning of April 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find out more about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/698158/how-to-apply-wwdc-keynote-watch-apple-park.html\">how to get tickets to WWDC</a> in our FAQ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WWDC keynote tickets have been free and randomly distributed for the past few years, but it previously cost $1,599 for developers to attend and those tickets sold out very quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even without a ticket, all registered Apple developers get online access to session videos, slides, and sample code throughout the week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will share additional conference information in advance of WWDC24 through the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-developer/id640199958/&amp;xcust=1-1-678333-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Developer app</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Further reading</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll update this article regularly in the run-up to WWDC, so check back to see the latest news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a broader view of the year’s plans, check out our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671090/new-apple-products.html\">new Apple products coming in 2024</a>.</p>\n\nApple Inc, Apple TV, iOS, Mac, MacOS, Personal Software</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"cee17c53d073065c1769f12712cbfaefb7d6c150a2513534ad506efce8dfe8a3","category":"Apple"}
