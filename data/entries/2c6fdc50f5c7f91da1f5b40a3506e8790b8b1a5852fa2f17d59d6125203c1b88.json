The M5 chip will make its debut with the iPad Pro, which is currently “in late testing” and is “on track” for the second half of this year. Gurman also reports that Apple will release an M5 MacBook Pro in the October/November timeframe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman refers to the M5 iPad Pro as a “chip-and-ship” model, meaning that the only major upgrade to the device will be a new processor. With the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369843/m4-ipad-pro-1tb-review.html\">M4 iPad Pro</a> released in July last year, Apple upgraded the display to OLED, made the device thinner, and moved the front-facing camera to the long side, in addition to the chip upgrade. That doesn’t leave much in the way of updates beyond the new chip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the M5 iPad Pro ships, it could be a while before the next iPad Pro upgrade. Gurman notes that Apple is already charting an M6 chip upgrade, but it won’t happen until 2027. The M6 iPad Pro will also feature an Apple C-series modem for wireless connectivity. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2626940/apple-c1-modem-real-world-tests-iphone-16e-download-upload-speeds-performance.html\">C1 modem</a> made its debut in the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2630661/iphone-16e-review.html\">iPhone 16e</a>, and future versions will feature faster mmWave performance and satellite connectivity, reports say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2552098/m5-macbook-pro-design-processor-specs-release.html\">M5 MacBook Pro</a> will also reportedly be a “chip-and-ship” upgrade. The 2026 MacBook Pro, however, is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2508939/major-changes-are-coming-to-the-macbook-pro-but-not-until-2026.html\">rumored</a> to feature a major revamp that coincides with the laptop’s 20th anniversary. Besides the aforementioned M6, it will also get an OLED display and a thinner design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M5 is expected to offer an incremental performance boost from the M4, likely in the range of 15 to 25 percent in CPU speed. That alone may not be compelling enough for owners of recent M-series iPad Pros and MacBook Pros to upgrade, but it will offer a significant boost over older devices.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2c6fdc50f5c7f91da1f5b40a3506e8790b8b1a5852fa2f17d59d6125203c1b88","category":"Apple"}
