{"title":"Last Call for This Batch of DF T-Shirts and Hoodies","link":"https://store.daringfireball.net/","date":1734403260000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://store.daringfireball.net/\">\n<img src=\"/members/images/2024/classic-triblend-976.png\" alt=\"Photo of a Daring Fireball logo t-shirt.\" height=\"445\" width=\"445\" />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly given that I went a few years without selling DF-branded shirts, while I procrastinated on launching a modernized new store (long story short: Shopify is a killer platform — the new store now supports everything from Apple Pay to order tracking), response to this round of classic logo apparel has been great. Orders from last week started going out over the weekend, and hundreds more are shipping today.</p>\n\n<p>It’s too late now to get an order in for Christmas, no matter where you live, but it’s not too late to place an order from this batch of shirts and hoodies. But, we’ll probably close the store to new orders tomorrow (Tuesday), so don’t wait. My sincere thanks to everyone who’s bought one (or in many cases, more than one).</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/16/last-call-this-batch-of-df-shirts\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"657dc29aefba23724b22d95a8859f86b2e90c4d48a3c6580d5cf7f44c7da7e20","category":"Tech"}
