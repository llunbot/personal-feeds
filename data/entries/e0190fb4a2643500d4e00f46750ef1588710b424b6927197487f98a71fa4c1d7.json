The title is among the first VR/MR games to be officially confirmed for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/apple-reveals-reality-pro-a-ar-vr-headset-unlike-any-other/\">Apple's highly anticipated $3,500 wearable computing device</a>, which is expected early next year.</p>\n<p>After <em>Demeo</em>'s <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/demeo-is-the-best-multiplayer-virtual-reality-dd-clone-ever-made/\">launch in 2021</a>, Resolution Games <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/developer-post/1162380661353301/?locale=en_GB\">added a Mixed Reality update</a> late last year that places in-game objects on top of a view of the real world (via passthrough cameras on compatible headsets like Meta's Quest 2 and Quest Pro and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/meta-beats-apple-to-the-mixed-reality-punch-with-499-quest-3-coming-this-fall/\">the upcoming Quest 3</a>). A <a href=\"https://youtu.be/keIUpF55F2I\">\"Mixed Reality 2.0\" update</a> for the game, launching today, adds support for controller-free hand-tracking as well as \"co-location\" of mixed reality items, which can now appear in the same place for multiple users in the same physical room.</p>\n<p>Those kinds of MR features will be useful on the Apple Vision Pro, which doesn't use handheld controllers and is primarily focused on MR apps that can be layered over a view of the real world. But Resolution Games says Vision Pro will also support a \"fully virtual\" version of the game that doesn't integrate passthrough images.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966018#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966018&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e0190fb4a2643500d4e00f46750ef1588710b424b6927197487f98a71fa4c1d7","category":"Tech"}
