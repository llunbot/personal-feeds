Since then, Google has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-is-flawed-by-design-and-a-new-company-blog-post-hints-at-why/\">offered a partial apology/explanation</a> for generating those kinds of results and has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/01/technology/google-ai-overviews-rollback.html\">reportedly rolled back the feature's rollout</a> for at least some types of queries.</p>\n<p>But the more I've thought about that rollout, the more I've begun to question the wisdom of Google's AI-powered search results in the first place. Even when the system doesn't give obviously wrong results, condensing search results into a neat, compact, AI-generated summary seems like a fundamental misunderstanding of the way people use Google in the first place.</p>\n<h2>Reliability and relevance</h2>\n<p>When people type a question into the Google search bar, they only sometimes want the kind of basic reference information that can be found on a Wikipedia page or corporate website (or even <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/03/european-copyright-google-tax-on-snippets/\">a Google information snippet</a>). Often, they're looking for subjective information where there is no one \"right\" answer: \"What are the best Mexican restaurants in Santa Fe?\" or \"What should I do with my kids on a rainy day?\" or \"How can I prevent cheese from sliding off my pizza?\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028826#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028826&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1cd83ae00d5f472adc18af65ca2955140977a6770b3ed80eaa91e6472c4be39c","category":"Tech"}
