On the descent, after crossing the finish line, I was following a bike, the rider missed a bend and was found 20 metres below,” Gilbert said before today’s stage start in Pau. </p><p>Gilbert was joined in the rescue mission by four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome (Israel Start-Up Nation) and Christopher Juul-Jensen (Team BikeExchange).</p><p>“We stopped to rescue him… These are facts that are not known to the press, but yesterday I gave up almost twenty minutes to help this man. We called for help because he was badly messed up. These are experiences that we also live.” </p><p>The condition of the crashed fan is unknown. </p></div></div>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"0ed8d3cf915a52a456ece5654e516f294139e47941330ad360120ca5dbafea6a","category":"Cycling"}
