Those are the ones that pit you head-to-head with other riders on the track. And these disciplines require a careful balance of aerodynamic speed, stiffness, and handling that’s a bit different than when you are burning solo laps in tight circles on the boards. These are the one we see with some of the most powerful cyclists going shoulder-to-shoulder around the steep banked turns at shockingly high speeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ridley Omnium Fast aero carbon track bike for group racing</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-Ridley-Omnium-Fast-aero-carbon-track-bike.webp\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-Ridley-Omnium-Fast-aero-carbon-track-bike.webp\" alt=\"2025 Ridley Omnium Fast aero carbon track bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-Ridley-Omnium-Fast-aero-carbon-track-bike.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-Ridley-Omnium-Fast-aero-carbon-track-bike-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-Ridley-Omnium-Fast-aero-carbon-track-bike-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-Ridley-Omnium-Fast-aero-carbon-track-bike-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-Ridley-Omnium-Fast-aero-carbon-track-bike-768x461.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-Ridley-Omnium-Fast-aero-carbon-track-bike-2048x1229.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Ridley)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Just over a year ago Ridley launched <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ridley-arena-track-bikes-hit-the-velodrome-in-fast-carbon-or-affordable-a-alloy/\" target=\"_blank\">two new Arena track bikes</a> – either the affordable alloy all-rounder or the no-holds-barred aero carbon Arena Fast, but for group racing on the velodrome – like scratch, tempo, elimination &amp;

That custom bit comes down to the fact that almost all riders are going to tailor their bike build to their own individual needs. So for the most part they expect to sell the new Omnium Fast as a frameset, for 5000€ which includes the carbon frame, fork with flip-chip, proprietary aero seatpost, headset, and also a 30mm Rotor Track axle + 144×5 BCD Rotor Track Spider + Cema Interlock bottom bracket – you supply the crankarms, for some reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-Ridley-Omnium-Fast-aero-carbon-track-bike_complete.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-Ridley-Omnium-Fast-aero-carbon-track-bike_complete.webp\" alt=\"2025 Ridley Omnium Fast aero carbon track bike, complete\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-Ridley-Omnium-Fast-aero-carbon-track-bike_complete.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-Ridley-Omnium-Fast-aero-carbon-track-bike_complete-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-Ridley-Omnium-Fast-aero-carbon-track-bike_complete-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-Ridley-Omnium-Fast-aero-carbon-track-bike_complete-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-Ridley-Omnium-Fast-aero-carbon-track-bike_complete-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if you do want a ready-to-ride complete Ridley also offers a 6000€ Omnium Fast build with a basic alloy Miche crankset, shallow alloy DT Swiss T1800 wheels, a Selle Italia SLR saddle, and the new Forza Track handlebar.
