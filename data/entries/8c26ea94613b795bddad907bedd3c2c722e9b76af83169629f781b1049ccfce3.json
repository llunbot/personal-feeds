[...]</p>\n\n<p>The screenless device, which does not require a nearby cell phone\nto work, uses a combination of voice and gestures for input and\ncan display information by projecting it onto nearby objects.</p>\n\n<p>Details: In his TED talk, Chaudhri showed the wearable, which sat\nin his jacket pocket, translating his own voice into French.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>He also answered a phone call from his wife with the call\ninformation appearing as a green image projected onto his hand.</p></li>\n<li><p>“This is good AI in action,” he said, promising more details\nwould be released in the coming months.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The device — which seemingly doesn’t yet have an announced name? — looks about 2 inches wide and 1 inch high, and is worn on your chest like a Star Trek communicator badge. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/04/humane-ted-bethany-is-calling.jpeg\">Here’s an image of the phone call information projected onto Chaudhri’s hand</a>.
