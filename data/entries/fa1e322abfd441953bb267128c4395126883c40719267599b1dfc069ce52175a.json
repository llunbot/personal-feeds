The BlockChance Bitcoin Ticket Miner turns solo mining into more of a low-power lottery that can sit quietly on your desk without you needing to do a thing, and it’s on sale. Instead of paying $149.99, right now, this Bitcoin Ticket Miner is on sale for $49.97, but that ends very soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of joining a huge mining pool for tiny payouts, this device sends solo “tickets” to the Bitcoin network for a chance at a full block reward. It runs at about 1,000 KH/s, which is roughly 18 times more hashing power than many hobby ticket miners, so it can submit far more tickets in the same amount of time. The screen on the front shows your current hashrate, ticket activity, pool connection, and simple probability stats, so you can actually see what it’s doing without opening a terminal window. Everything runs on its own hardware with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, so you plug it in with the included USB-C cable, connect it to your network, and let it run without a separate computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Power draw is around 18 watts, which is less than a typical light bulb, and there is a quiet fan to keep it cool enough that you can keep it on all the time. It’s still important to remember that solo mining is based on chance, and there’s no guaranteed payout, but it’s a fun way to give yourself the opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, it’s only $50 to get a<a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/blockchance-bitcoin-ticket-miner?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-12394&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=blockchance-bitcoin-ticket-miner-2026-02-18&amp;utm_term=SALE-328964\" target=\"_blank\"> BlockChance™ Bitcoin Ticket Miner</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sale ends February 22 at 11:59 p.m. PT.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp1.stackassets.com/b8c405175d6b18813439ba31566fb89416d04a16/store/4ea3673ff86aae5e6e2c3fdee088a5b8a657f889f446de535f3d06a460e3/sale_328964_primary_image.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>BlockChance™ Bitcoin Ticket Miner<a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/blockchance-bitcoin-ticket-miner?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-12394&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=blockchance-bitcoin-ticket-miner&amp;utm_term=SALE-328964\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com/\" target=\"_blank\">StackSocial</a> prices subject to change</em>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"fa1e322abfd441953bb267128c4395126883c40719267599b1dfc069ce52175a","category":"Apple"}
