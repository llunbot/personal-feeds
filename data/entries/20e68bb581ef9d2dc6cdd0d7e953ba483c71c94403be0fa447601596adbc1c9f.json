The app also supports music video playback in resolutions up to 4K.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌Apple Music‌ allows users to listen in a variety of ways, including in the background or during gameplay. Music videos also support continuous playback when navigating to and from the ‌Apple Music‌ app. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/apple-music-ps5-menu.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to opening the ‌Apple Music‌ app, users can access ‌Apple Music‌ during gameplay by pressing the PS button on the DualSense wireless controller to access Control Center and the Music Function card. The Music Function card can display ‌Apple Music‌ recommendations to match the game that is currently being played, present playlists from a user's library, or even offer options to play ‌Apple Music‌ playlists specifically curated for gaming.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPS5 users can download the ‌Apple Music‌ app from the Media space and simply need to follow the on-screen instructions to link their ‌Apple Music‌ account. The process involves either scanning a QR code from an Apple device or manually entering <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a> credentials.
