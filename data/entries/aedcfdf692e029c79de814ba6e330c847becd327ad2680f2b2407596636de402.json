It’s a story about relationships, love, and a life journey.</p>\n<p>As far back as I can remember, I’ve always had a strong connection with animals, especially dogs. The bond that can form between human and canine is impossible to properly convey in words. The connection I had with Iris was unlike any I’ve ever had with another person. It was pure, unconditional love. Perhaps similar to having a child, I’d imagine. Not everyone might understand this, but if you’ve been lucky enough to share this kind of connection with an animal, then you know exactly where I’m coming from.</p>\n<p>I built this bond with a little pound pup from Kent, Washington. No, Iris wasn’t named after a flower, but after the iris ring that controls the aperture of a camera lens.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-2.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>In the summer of 2005, I was 23, fresh out of film school, and working in reality television on a show with the Knievel family, following Robbie around the country from jump to jump. Getting a dog wasn’t on my radar at all. My parents’ dog, Sadie, had just passed, and they were considering adopting another one. My sister and I took it upon ourselves to help them look. Back then, there weren’t as many websites or apps to browse available dogs like we have today.</p>\n<p>One particularly warm Saturday, I dropped by a shelter a few miles south of Seattle, just to look. I was with my girlfriend at the time, and the moment we stepped into the kennels, the place erupted with barking, yelping, and whining. But in the back of one large kennel, sitting quietly by herself, was a small, mostly black pup with two little brown spots over her eyes, a white chest, brown legs, and one white paw. She didn’t make a sound.</p>\n<p>I walked right past her, trying to avoid eye contact because I knew what would happen. If I took that dog out of her kennel to say hi, I’d end up taking her home.</p>\n<p>And that’s exactly what happened.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-9.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-9.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-13.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-13.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>My parents didn’t get a dog that day; I did. Little did I know that that tiny pup would shape my life for the better and make me the man I am today.</p>\n<p>I brought Iris home, not even knowing if my tiny West Seattle apartment allowed dogs. I didn’t care. She was so quiet and mellow as a puppy that nobody even noticed she was there. That never changed. Even as she grew older, she was always so silent that people often wouldn’t realize she was in the room, curled up at my feet. But when she did speak up, her deep bark meant something. It meant that I needed to listen.</p>\n<p>She protected me and the people closest to me. She sensed things that humans couldn’t. Even though she only understood a handful of words and gestures, she always seemed to know how I was feeling. She never judged me for my bad decisions. She was happy when I was happy. She was sad when I was sad. She felt everything I felt.</p>\n<p>Throughout her life, Iris touched and taught so many people about love. She was a role model for other dogs, and quite a few people as well. She was the kind of dog that everyone wished they had. In fact, I know of at least two people who were never “dog people” but ended up getting dogs because of her. She had a way of connecting with people on a level I haven’t seen in another dog. She was special.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-35.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-35.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-35.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-35.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, nothing lasts forever, but during her short time on this earth, we had countless adventures together. One of the greatest was our move from Seattle to Santa Cruz in 2012, starting a new life among the redwoods and by the sea. As she grew older, our adventures became shorter, but she still loved hanging out in the grass at Derby Skatepark, going to the beach, or taking short rides around town behind my bike in her dog trailer.</p>\n<p>On February 26, 2021, just a few months before her 16th birthday, I had to put Iris down. She went peacefully at home in my arms. I had her cremated because I knew I wanted to give her the best sendoff I could imagine. One last great adventure to spread her love and let her live on forever, with the hope that she might inspire or help someone else. I decided to ride my bike down the West Coast, spreading her ashes the entire way, retracing the journey we made together when we moved. It wasn’t necessarily the exact route we had taken before, but I wanted to leave her in the most beautiful places possible. Some spots we had visited together in the past, and some we hadn’t.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-51.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-51.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-51.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-51.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>That summer, a few months after Iris passed, I mapped out a route and planned to ride it self-supported, starting in downtown Seattle and ending at Iris’s spot on West Cliff in Santa Cruz, where we used to sit and watch the sunset. When I told my family about my plan, my dad surprised me by volunteering to come along and drive my car to support me while I pedaled the entire route. This caught me off guard because, growing up, my dad and I didn’t have much of a relationship. He wasn’t a deadbeat by any means. He did his best to support our family and raise my sister and me, but it often felt like he was there without truly being present. He had a short temper, little patience for emotions, and usually tried to solve problems with screaming and yelling, rather than conversation. In our house, feelings weren’t something you talked through; they were something you either buried deep down or just got over. I think a lot of this stems from his upbringing.</p>\n<p>My dad grew up in a strict Midwest Catholic household, where discipline came before understanding, and that mentality carried over into how he raised us. Maybe that’s why he left at such a young age, rarely looking back or visiting his hometown or family. He also came from a generation that saw therapy as a weakness, so whatever struggles he carried from his own upbringing were left unspoken and unresolved. By the time I was a senior in high school, we butted heads so much that I left home and spent the last two months before graduation living with a friend. The day after I graduated, I had already signed a lease on a small house with three other roommates a few towns over. I packed up all my belongings and got out of there as fast as I could.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-30.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-30.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-30.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-30.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>There was always this void in our father-son relationship that we never seemed to fill. We never had those classic “father-son” experiences. No camping or fishing trips, no road trips, no big bonding adventures with just the two of us. Looking back, I think I craved that kind of connection when I was younger. Maybe that’s why I had such a longing for adventure with Iris. We clocked in thousands of miles together on road trips. We hiked, we camped, and she went everywhere I went. She wasn’t just my adventure partner, she was also like a therapist.</p>\n<p>I confessed all my secrets to her, confided in her, and in return, she taught me how to love unconditionally. As Iris and I grew together, I think she helped me realize that I could forgive and let go of the past, to kind of start over and build a better relationship with my dad. That bond with him did grow, and it deepened as I got older. Still, I can’t help but wonder if that longing for connection is part of why I live the way I do now… treating almost every day like an adventure.</p>\n<p>So when he offered to join me on this journey, it meant the absolute world to me.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-60.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-60.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-60.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-60.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I probably owe my interest in bikes to my dad. Although as cyclists we were on completely opposite sides of the spectrum. He used to enjoy his once-a-year, three-day, fully-supported 150-mile Tri-Island fundraiser ride, whereas I like to ride for a week self-supported in the backcountry for fun. So when it came to supporting me on a 1,000+ mile ride, he had to learn by being thrown straight into the deep end.</p>\n<p>On day two of the ride, I was about 80 miles into my 140-mile route, pushing through heavily-semi truck-trafficked Highway 30 and battling wind and rain out to the coast, when my dad decided it would be a great idea to drive ahead and get a few things ready at the campsite. He didn’t consider that I only carry enough food and water to ride about 30 miles at a time, or that in the car he had all of my warm layers that I had stripped off earlier when the sun briefly came out. After all, if you have a support vehicle, why carry extra weight, right? But he also didn’t even tell me he was driving 60 miles ahead where there was no cell reception with everything I needed to safely finish the ride.</p>\n<p>I had just passed through a very small town without stopping, when luckily, one of my best friends, Brett, and his dog Winnie, met up with us near Astoria to hang out, camp, and take a few photos. I spotted him pulled over on the side of the road, camera in hand, and stopped to ask where my dad was. When Brett told me where he’d gone, I was completely dumbfounded. It hadn’t even crossed my dad’s mind that he was carrying everything I needed, especially on such a big day. Brett gave me the rest of the water and a couple of granola bars he had in his truck, which got me through to the end of the day. By the time I arrived at the campsite, I thought maybe my dad would have dinner cooking, or at least a fire going. But to my surprise, he didn’t. I couldn’t help but be pissed.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-26.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-26.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-26.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-26.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-33.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-33.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-33.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-33.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Luckily, I’d had some miles to think about how to approach the situation, and I knew I had to explain it in a way that he would definitely understand. We both loved Top Gun, so I asked if he remembered one of the film’s biggest lessons, “Never leave your wingman.”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” he replied.</p>\n<p>“Well,” I said, “you are my fucking wingman! I’m depending on you for everything I need to get down the road. If you weren’t here and I was riding alone, I’d be carrying everything on the bike and stopping in towns for food and water to resupply when I needed it. But I don’t stop, because I think you’ll be there waiting for me. I am your wingman, and you never leave your wingman!”</p>\n<p>That did it. He got it. And from that day on, he was on top of his game. He started pulling over every 30 miles or so, laying out real food packed with calories. He had the fixings for a bean, cheese, and avocado burrito, with pickles, bars, and two cold water bottles waiting on the tailgate. At the end of each day, he even had a recovery drink chilled and waiting for me. We were a solid team after that. It made me realize that I wasn’t doing this ride alone; I was doing it with Iris, and also with my dad.</p>\n<p>We joked about the wingman thing daily after that. And still to this day, we have a good laugh about it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-47.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-47.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-47.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-47.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>About five miles into the sixth day of riding, I crossed the state line into California and spread Iris’s ashes right below the “Welcome to California” sign. This was an emotional spot for me. Even though I was still about 500 miles from Santa Cruz, I couldn’t have felt more at home. After that, the miles became easier and easier.</p>\n<p>As we pushed further south, the weather grew warmer, and the days in the saddle felt shorter. I’d usually wake up around 6:30, make some coffee, eat two breakfasts, and be on the bike before 8 a.m. Starting early was great because it meant my dad and I had more time together after the ride. Even if most of that time was spent with him watching me eat multiple meals until it was time for bed.</p>\n<p>On our one rest day, we splurged on a hotel with a hot tub, which I made multiple visits to, while also doing laundry and grocery shopping. This was surprisingly a lot of fun for both of us. We spent time combing the aisles, reading every single label, searching for the most calorie-packed foods.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-34.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-34.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-34.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-34.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>My dad had only one request for the California leg of the trip, and it had to do with the route: he wanted to visit Petaluma and have lunch at Lagunitas, one of his favorite breweries that he’d never been to. I’ve ridden Highway 1 multiple times, so I gladly rerouted East from Bodega Bay to Petaluma. It worked out perfectly, as San Francisco was about the halfway point of the following day. Just as I rolled through Marin County, I had the pleasure of meeting up with a few familiar faces who joined me for the ride across the Golden Gate and through the city. It was refreshing to be able to ride with friends.</p>\n<p>Then, just 55 miles from my front door, the day couldn’t have ended any better. Brenna, my life partner and best friend, the one person I wanted to see the most, was patiently waiting on the side of the road with a huge smile and a long embrace. Even though we were staying at a hotel, being with her felt like I was already home.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-79.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-79.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-79.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-79.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The following day would be the last few miles of our journey, and every single one of them was pure smile miles. A group of Santa Cruz friends met me on the route and pulled me all the way into town, ending at Iris’s spot on West Cliff, where even more friends were waiting. Brenna had set out a small table with a few old photos as a sentimental tribute to Iris. After a round of celebratory hugs and popping a bottle of bubbly, I let some of Iris’s ashes fly in the wind and out to sea.</p>\n<p>Even though I rode nearly every mile of this trip solo, I never once felt alone. Sharing this journey with my dad was the best thing we’ve ever done together, and I couldn’t have asked for a better wingman.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-68.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-68.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-68.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-68.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-70.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-70.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-70.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-70.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Iris was the absolute best friend I could have ever asked for. She was there for me through the good times and the bad, quietly watching me grow from just a pup myself. She taught me about love, and about life. She put up with always being the #1 model in front of my lens, and endured all of my shenanigans with unwavering patience. Always by my side on countless adventures and road trips, she was more than just a companion, she was a role model. She listened to me without judgment, and if she could have written a book about all the things I told her over the years, I can only imagine what it would say. She grew old with majestic beauty and perpetual grace, never losing that fire inside. This one last big adventure was all for her.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-92.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-92.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-92.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Riding_Iris_Tailwind-92.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I love you so much, Iris.
