On Apple Watch, the colors trace each numeral of the watch face and react in real time as the user moves their wrist based on input from the gyroscope. On <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, beams of color spell out \"Pride\" and dynamically move when the user unlocks their device. For the first time, the Pride watch face and wallpapers can be customized to show colors representing LGBTQ+ communities. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new braided Solo Loop is available starting May 22.  The new Pride Radiance watch face and ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ wallpaper will be available soon with watchOS 10.5, iOS 17.5, and iPadOS 17.5.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>More to follow...</strong> <br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-unveils-2024-pride-edition-band/\">Apple Unveils 2024 Pride Edition Braided Solo Loop Band</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-unveils-2024-pride-edition-braided-solo-loop-band.2425521/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"78596a4eea4264c222d490a3d010e2a0378af71eb9371c2895225be5eaeb7868","category":"Apple"}
