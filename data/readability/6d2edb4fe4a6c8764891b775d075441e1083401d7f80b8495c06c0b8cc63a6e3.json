The bags are cleanly designed and rendered in classic blacks that are sure to look sleek and unobtrusive on road and gravel bikes alike.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22142518/pro-bags-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22142518/pro-bags-1.png\" alt=\"a pro discover frame bag\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22142518/pro-bags-1.png 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22142518/pro-bags-1-297x198.png 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22142518/pro-bags-1-800x534.png 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22142518/pro-bags-1-120x80.png 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22142518/pro-bags-1-768x512.png 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22142518/pro-bags-1-1536x1024.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><h2>PRO Discover Team Handlebar and Frame Bag Details</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22145432/pro-bags-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22145432/pro-bags-2.png\" alt=\"The PRO Discover Team handlebar bag small\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22145432/pro-bags-2.png 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22145432/pro-bags-2-297x198.png 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22145432/pro-bags-2-800x534.png 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22145432/pro-bags-2-120x80.png 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22145432/pro-bags-2-768x512.png 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22145432/pro-bags-2-1536x1024.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The Pro Discover Team range of <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2018/11/28/handlebar-bag-roundup-new-bags-from-swift-industries-sentier-adventure-gear/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bike bags</a> is aimed squarely at gravel and adventure riders. The PRO Discover Team Handlebar Bag is small but mighty, coming in at 2 L with pockets <em>and&nbsp;</em>a side pouch. It’s waterproof to boot. The bag is intended for short trips or in conjunction with the larger <a href=\"https://www.pro-bikegear.com/us/accessories/on-bike-bags/discover-handlebar-bag\">Discover Handlebar Bag</a>. The small PRO Discover Team Frame Bag is similarly svelte, with a 2.7-L capacity and (near) universal frame compatibility. Rounding out the set is the PRO Discover Team Saddlebag, a 600 ml bag designed to hold tools and other need-to-reach-fast gear. The roll-style closure ensures it can pack down small when it needs to.</p><p>Taken together, the set provides about 5 L of storage space—enough to store some necessities for one-day adventures off the beaten path. All the bags feature reflective details and are constructed of waterproof and seam-sealed material.</p><h2>PRO Performance Saddlebag Details</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22150338/pro-bag-5-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22150338/pro-bag-5-1.jpg\" alt=\"the pro performance tool wrap\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22150338/pro-bag-5-1.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22150338/pro-bag-5-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22150338/pro-bag-5-1-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22150338/pro-bag-5-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22150338/pro-bag-5-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22150338/pro-bag-5-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>PRO bag additions to the Performance Range are saddlebags, saddlebags, saddlebags. Four to be exact, in 400 ml, 600 ml, 1 L, and 2 L sizes. They all sport universal saddle compatibility and are built of 420 denier nylon.</p><p>The organization is key when it comes to tools, which is why the PRO Performance Tool Wrap is so nifty. It can hold two tire levers, a spare tube, a CO2 cartridge, a mini tool, and a mini pump—and every item has its own slot in the wrap. The wrap is made of the same 420 denier nylon as the saddlebags and has reflective trim and a rear light mounting strap as icing on the cake.</p><p>Contact your local <a href=\"https://www.pro-bikegear.com/us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PRO</a> distributor or visit the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=ale&amp;pw=147535&amp;mi=11473&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FPRO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc\">PRO section of Jenson USA for more details</a>.</p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Andrew Marshall","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"6d2edb4fe4a6c8764891b775d075441e1083401d7f80b8495c06c0b8cc63a6e3","category":"Cycling"}
