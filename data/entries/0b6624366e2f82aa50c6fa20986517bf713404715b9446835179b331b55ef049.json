In the wake of allegations of sexual assault against Gaiman this summer, the streaming platform has decided that rather than a full slate of episodes, the series finale will be a single 90-minute episode—the equivalent of a TV movie.</p>\n<p><strong>(Major spoilers for the S2 finale of <em>Good Omens</em> below.)</strong></p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/06/jon-hamm-is-an-amnesiac-archangel-lost-in-soho-in-good-omens-s2-trailer/\">reported previously</a>, the series is based on the original 1990 novel by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman\">Gaiman</a> and the <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/terry-pratchett-docudrama-back-in-black-is-beautiful-an-1792358351\">late Pratchett</a>. <em>Good Omens</em> is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/all-hell-is-breaking-loose-in-first-trailer-for-much-anticipated-good-omens/\">the story of</a> an angel, Aziraphale (Michael Sheen), and a demon, Crowley (David Tennant), who gradually become friends over the millennia and team up to avert Armageddon. Gaiman's obvious deep-down, fierce love for this project—and the powerful chemistry between its stars—made the first season <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/review-neil-gaimans-tv-adaptation-of-good-omens-is-glorious-good-fun/\">a sheer joy</a> to watch.
