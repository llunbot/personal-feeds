The fallout led to Pantani struggling with his mental health and he died in February 2004 of cocaine poisoning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The circumstances surrounding his death have remained somewhat of a mystery, with someone initially convicted of supplying Pantani with a dangerous dose of cocaine, before that was overturned in 2011. The case was opened again five years later before being dropped and then opened again in 2021.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/doping-cycling\">Doping in cycling: Everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Men’s Tour de France 2023: Stage-by-stage preview and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/marco-pantani-the-birth-of-il-pirata\">Marco Pantani: The birth of ‘Il Pirata’</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Many books have been written about Pantani, his career and his death, and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-best-cycling-documentaries\" target=\"_blank\">documentaries</a> have been made too, including <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/the-natural-marco-pantani-film-review\" target=\"_blank\">some that question the doping allegations he faced</a>, and this latest audio-only series will investigate the uncertainty surrounding his death, including allegations of mafia involvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trailer is available to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0fvl6f0\" target=\"_blank\">listen to now on BBC Sounds</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous ‘Sport’s Strangest Crimes’ series include stories about Formula 1’s ‘Spygate’ controversy, Notts County’s ‘Trillion Dollar Conman’, ‘The Man Who Bought Cricket’ and ‘Shergar the Super Horse’.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/marco-pantani-podcast\">BBC to release podcast series on Marco Pantani’s death hosted by Hugh Dennis</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Deputy Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"51a372ae6490d1957633758c0479281e755067920f28254ab5ddb6a25cd2defe","category":"Cycling"}
