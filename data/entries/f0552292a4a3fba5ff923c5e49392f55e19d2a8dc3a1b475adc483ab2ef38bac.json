This is a rumor we have heard from other sources before, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/iphone-16-pro-tetraprism-lens-rumor/\">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/tetraprism-lens-iphone-16-pro/\">our own reporting</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPhone-16-Cameras-Feature-1.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nTrendForce briefly mentioned this information today <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240226-12042.html\">in a press release</a> focused on the overall smartphone camera lens market:<blockquote>Following the successful launch of the iPhone 15 Pro Max with its exclusive Tetraprism telephoto zoom lens, the industry is expected to see an increase in the adoption of periscopic lens modules. Apple plans to bring this advanced hardware upgrade to the iPhone 16 Pro, making it accessible to more users in the Pro series.</blockquote>In the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the tetraprism camera system has a \"folded\" design that allows it to fit inside the smartphone, enabling <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-max-25x-digital-zoom/\">up to 5x optical zoom and up to 25x digital zoom</a>. By comparison, the smaller iPhone 15 Pro remains limited to up to 3x optical zoom, in line with the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt has been rumored that the iPhone 16 Pro will feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/\">larger 6.3-inch display</a>, compared to the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 Pro. This change would increase the overall size of the device, which could provide additional internal space for a tetraprism camera.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to unveil the iPhone 16 series in September.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/trendforce/\">TrendForce</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/26/both-iphone-16-pro-models-5x-optical-zoom-rumor/\">Both iPhone 16 Pro Models Again Rumored to Feature 5x Optical Zoom</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/both-iphone-16-pro-models-again-rumored-to-feature-5x-optical-zoom.2420433/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f0552292a4a3fba5ff923c5e49392f55e19d2a8dc3a1b475adc483ab2ef38bac","category":"Apple"}
