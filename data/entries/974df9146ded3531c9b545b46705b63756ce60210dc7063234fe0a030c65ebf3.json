Why following the iPhone is the wrong strategy","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2640346/apple-watch-se-3-or-11e-why-following-the-iphone-is-the-wrong-strategy.html","date":1742296500000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple introduced the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667407/iphone-se-review.html\">first iPhone SE</a> back in 2016, letting customers get the full iOS experience at a lower price. The SE branding was then extended to the Apple Watch line, which followed the SE model with a<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234647/apple-watch-se-review.html\"> low-cost smartwatch built on an older design</a>. Now that the iPhone SE has been discontinued in favor of the newly released 16e model, we’re left wondering: Will the heavily rumored update to the Apple Watch SE 2 arrive as an SE 3 or 11e?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple’s SE formula</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SE iPhones and Apple Watches have long taken the same general route. They pack the latest processors offered by their flagship counterparts while missing out on the modern exterior designs and other higher-end perks, such as extra cameras, MagSafe charging, and health sensors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The now-retired iPhone SE 3, for example, was powered by Apple’s A15 Bionic—the same high-performance chip found in the most capable iPhone 13 Pro at the time. Despite its might, however, it resembled a classic iPhone with its thick bezels, physical Home button, single camera, and overall prehistoric design. Similarly, the Apple Watch SE 2 arrived alongside the Series 8 model in 2022 with the same S8 chip. Nevertheless, the affordable variant misses out on the larger, sleeker display options, Ultra Wideband chip, ECG support, wrist temperature sensor, fast charging, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point of Apple’s SE devices is to provide users with the same reliable experience as the premium devices without a premium price. While these devices lack the modern designs of more expensive editions, they typically don’t lag or misbehave as many budget-friendly devices do. They also support the latest versions of iOS and watchOS and promise years of updates. It’s just what many people want in a smartwatch—a device that does basic health tracking, shows notifications, and feels fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The new ‘e’ recipe</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With its latest iPhone, Apple has decided to replace the iPhone SE branding with an all-new “e” designation—and it’s not just a label switch, it’s a new formula: The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2630661/iphone-16e-review.html\">iPhone 16e</a> offers the newest processor with a modern chassis, albeit still a couple of years old. While users still miss out on some handy perks such as native MagSafe support, ultrawide lens, and Dynamic Island, the phone no longer looks like it has escaped from a bygone era. The upgrade, however, has hiked the entry-level iPhone’s price from $429 to $599, essentially removing it from the budget category.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Apple-Watch-top-view.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Watch top view\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Apple-Watch-top-view.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Apple-Watch-top-view.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Apple-Watch-top-view.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Apple-Watch-top-view.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Apple-Watch-top-view.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Apple-Watch-top-view.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Apple-Watch-top-view.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Apple-Watch-top-view.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The next Apple Watch SE doesn’t need any of the premium features from the newest models to be successful.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Will the same fate befall the Apple Watch SE? If Apple were to release a Watch 11e this fall, it would theoretically adopt the S11 chip along with the Series 7’s larger case options of 41mm and 45mm case options—an upgrade from 40mm and 44mm on the current SE. Otherwise, it could support some of the newer features that rely on the faster processor, such as sleep apnea detection and on-device Siri with health data access. Naturally, it would miss out on some of the higher-end features that require additional sensors, such as ECG scans and temperature tracking. In this case, the Apple Watch 11e would act more like a lower-end Series 11.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t know what to expect from the next Apple Watch SE 2, but credible rumors have suggested it will use a plastic case. The switch would supposedly reduce manufacturing costs, potentially dropping its price to under $200. This would help it compete against cheaper wearables sold by rival brands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, the Apple Watch sounds more like an SE than an “e” model. Unlike the iPhone 16e, the Apple Watch SE 3 will seemingly cost less by splitting off from the flagship range with lower-end materials rather than a mix of high-end parts and a modern design. And that would be the smartest move for the third generation of the budget smartwatch.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Apple-Watch-side-view.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Watch side view\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Apple-Watch-side-view.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Apple-Watch-side-view.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Apple-Watch-side-view.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Apple-Watch-side-view.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Apple-Watch-side-view.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Apple-Watch-side-view.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Apple-Watch-side-view.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Apple-Watch-side-view.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The SE 3 will reportedly be the first Apple Watch made of plastic.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Keep the ‘S’</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the iPhone 16e looks significantly more modern than its SE predecessor, it dropped its best quality—a budget price. We already have the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus for those seeking a mid-tier flagship—not to mention the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus still on sale. Customers need a cheaper iPhone, not a pricey handset that borrows bits and pieces from every other model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same applies to smartwatches, the next budget Apple Watch should stick with the SE moniker. Just as we thought the iPhone SE 4 would remain a sub-$499 phone, the Apple Watch SE 3 is expected to be as low as $199. If Apple shifts its strategy with a 16e-style Apple Watch, it would be an even bigger mistake. A simple stripped-down Apple Watch with a plastic body and maybe an always-on display for $229 or $199 would be a fantastic value. A $299 Apple Watch with a slightly larger screen and fast charging would not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple made a strategic decision with the iPhone 16e, but the world needs an Apple Watch SE. So please Apple, don’t change a winning formula.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"974df9146ded3531c9b545b46705b63756ce60210dc7063234fe0a030c65ebf3","category":"Apple"}
