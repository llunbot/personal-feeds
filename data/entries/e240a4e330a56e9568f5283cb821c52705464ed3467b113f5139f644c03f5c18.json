Apple has continued on updating the Apple Watch each year, and in 2021, we're expecting the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-7/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a> to see a release sometime in October.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe original 2015 Apple Watch now qualifies for Apple's \"vintage\" list, which includes devices that Apple stopped distributing for sale more than five years ago and less than seven years ago.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor most products, the vintage designation means that they're no longer eligible for repairs at the Genius Bar in Apple retail stores or from Apple Authorized Service Providers, but Apple does offer extended repairs of some vintage products and in locations where extended repairs are required by law.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn another couple of years, the original Apple Watch will move on to the obsolete list and hardware service will be entirely discontinued.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/30/apple-watch-vintage-products/\">Original Apple Watch Added to Apple's 'Vintage Products' List</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/original-apple-watch-added-to-apples-vintage-products-list.2314657/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nRVytUN5Vo0:ZAupKRG5AXs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nRVytUN5Vo0:ZAupKRG5AXs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/nRVytUN5Vo0\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e240a4e330a56e9568f5283cb821c52705464ed3467b113f5139f644c03f5c18","category":"Apple"}
