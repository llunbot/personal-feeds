It couldn’t be more honest – it’s a case, it’s made from upcycled materials, and yes, it’s essential.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/10062/chpt3-upcycled-essentials-case-review-photos#4\"><p><span>Image 5 of</span> 11</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/09/chpt3_upcycled_essentials_case_5.jpg?itok=Ti4DXP32\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 5 of </span>11</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Stash it and go</h3>\n<p>There’s nowhere to hide if a product designed with simplicity and practicality at its heart doesn’t actually work. The Chpt3 Upcycled Essentials Case, however, is a triumph of well considered design, from a team that actually rides bikes so knows what we need.</p>\n<p>Two main compartments are revealed within, with the first very easily swallowing an iPhone 8 and paper money. The second is the ideal place for a bank card, which is held in place by an internal pouch. Between the two is ample room for a couple of tyre levers and your house keys. Crucially, none of the above gets a drop of moisture on it, thanks to the waterproof zipper that runs along three sides of the case.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/10062/chpt3-upcycled-essentials-case-review-photos#5\"><p><span>Image 6 of</span> 11</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/09/chpt3_upcycled_essentials_case_6.jpg?itok=fiIClDWD\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 6 of </span>11</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Eco credentials</h3>\n<p>As any marketing department knows, the best eco-friendly elements of a product’s design have a story attached. The Chpt3 Upcycled Essentials Case has a belter…</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://chpt3.com/products/essentials-case\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Chpt3 Upcycled Essentials case now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>The facing side of the case is made from used inner tubes stitched together and bears a laser-etched CHPT3 logo. The case is handmade in Barcelona – a stone’s throw (or rather, a short train journey) from the Girona HQ of Chpt3, and these tubes are sourced from bikes used on the local area’s public cycling network. It’s a wonderful example of local businesses’ joined-up thinking.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/10062/chpt3-upcycled-essentials-case-review-photos#3\"><p><span>Image 4 of</span> 11</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/09/chpt3_upcycled_essentials_case_4.jpg?itok=HmdmBRzM\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 4 of </span>11</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Third dimension</h3>\n<p>The Chpt3 Upcycled Essentials Case measures 18cm x 9cm x 2cm, in case you fancied laying out your mid-ride essentials in that kind of area to see if they’ll fit before you part with your cash.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/10106/ineos-grenadiers-disc-brakes\">RIP rim brakes: Ineos Grenadiers are finally racing on discs</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/10109/specialized-romin-saddle-goes-3d-printed\">Specialized Romin saddle goes 3D printed</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/10101/how-to-watch-uci-world-championships\">How to watch the UCI World Championships 2021: Full schedule for live TV and highlights</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nBut the trick here is that it doesn’t even cost silly money – for the price of a round of drinks and a greasy burger on your way home, you’re getting a case that slips into (and stays secure within) a jersey pocket, aptly organises the things you want to keep dry, looks particularly stylish, and is doing its bit to repurpose waste materials.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://chpt3.com/products/essentials-case\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Chpt3 Upcycled Essentials case now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>It’s not so small that you’ll constantly be reaching round to check it’s there, but it’s not to big that it impinges upon comfort. And, of course, you’re buying into a brand name that might have been seemed beyond your reach five years ago. For my money, this is probably the best riding wallet-cum-case I’ve ever used, at any budget. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/reviews/10062/chpt3-upcycled-essentials-case-review-photos\">Chpt3 Upcycled Essentials case review photos</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/reviews\">Reviews</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>7 Sep 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F10062%2Fchpt3-upcycled-essentials-case-review-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Chpt3%20Upcycled%20Essentials%20case%20review%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F10062%2Fchpt3-upcycled-essentials-case-review-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Chpt3%20Upcycled%20Essentials%20case%20review%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F10062%2Fchpt3-upcycled-essentials-case-review-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Chpt3%20Upcycled%20Essentials%20case%20review%20photos&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F10062%2Fchpt3-upcycled-essentials-case-review-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/10062/chpt3-upcycled-essentials-case-review-photos#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 11</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/09/chpt3_upcycled_essentials_case_1.jpg?itok=uQQzW_-L\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/panniers-bags-packs-and-luggage\">Panniers, bags, packs and luggage</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"9c1d11146c6e101e55e642ece8d1eadf5eced20dfbfda1ed5f1bfd3b08a8c9fe","category":"Cycling"}
