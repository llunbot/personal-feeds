But I don’t think anyone would have predicted how today’s Paris-Roubaix Femmes would have unfolded. </span></p>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>It all boiled down to a sprint finish in the iconic velodrome, with EF Education-TIBCO-SBV rider Alison Jackson crossing the finish line first in absolute disbelief. With her sights set on being part of the action, the Canadian said she wanted to be in the race today, as her team had been waiting and waiting so far this season, but little did she know she would be the one standing on top of the podium. </span></p>\n<p><span>Jackson formed part of the early breakaway alongside 18 other riders including Alice Towers (Canyon-SRAM), Femke Markus (SD Worx) and Julia Borgström (AG Insurance - Soudal - Quick-Step), leading the race with an impressive five-minute lead. The chasing group behind, featuring many of the race's favourites, had some work to do to bring them in.</span></p>\n<p><span>Despite several attacks and decisive crashes behind, the breakaway managed to hold their own and lead the way into the velodrome, finishing off an exciting day with an even more exciting finish as the six riders who remained sprinted for the 2023 title. </span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/00Longo-Borghini_start01_Paris_Roubaix_femmes_2023.jpg?v=1680974637\" alt=\"Elisa Longo Borghini at the start of Paris-Roubaix\" /></span></p>\n<p>Elisa Longo Borghini was back at this year's Paris-Roubaix looking to defend her title. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/01start01_Paris_Roubaix_femmes_2023.jpg?v=1680974693\" alt /></p>\n<p>Paris-Roubaix Femmes is one of the most anticipated Classics, not only in the women's WorldTour calendar, but cycling fans too. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/02fans_start01_Paris_Roubaix_femmes_2023.jpg?v=1680974758\" alt /></p>\n<p>Fans line the streets, looking forward to seeing the women's peloton battle it out over the brutal cobbles.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/03fans02_Paris_Roubaix_femmes_2023.jpg?v=1680974803\" alt /></p>\n<p>Fans of all ages come out to see the third edition of the women's race.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/04breakaway01_alison_jackson_carrefour_de_l_arbre_Paris_Roubaix_femmes_2023.jpg?v=1680974850\" alt /></p>\n<p>Alison Jackson was part of the early breakaway who were never caught by the chasing group, pushing it all the way to the finish line. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/05breakaway_orchies_sector_Paris_Roubaix_femmes_2023.jpg?v=1680974923\" alt /></p>\n<p>The women's peloton had 17 cobblestone sections to deal with during the 145.4km-long route. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/06fans03_Paris_Roubaix_femmes_2023.jpg?v=1680975004\" alt /></p>\n<p>Fans cheering on the women's peloton. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/07fans_Trek_Paris_Roubaix_femmes_2023.jpg?v=1680975033\" alt /></p>\n<p>Trek-Segafredo has dominated Paris-Roubaix Femmes, winning the 2021 and 2022 edition. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/08Daniek_Henglefeld_Auchy-les-Orchies_sector_Paris_Roubaix_femmes_2023.jpg?v=1680975094\" alt /></p>\n<p><span>Daniek Hengeveld (Team DSM) pulled away from the breakaway, pushing on solo for over 30km. </span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/09Longo_Borghini_Auchy-les-Orchies_sector_Paris_Roubaix_femmes_2023.jpg?v=1680975277\" alt /></span></p>\n<p><span>Former champion Longo Borghini put in an impressive performance today at Paris-Roubaix Femmes, but a nasty crash put her out of contention, coming 21st overall. </span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/11Lotte_Kopecky_Carrefour_de_l_Arbre_sector_Paris_Roubaix_femmes_2023.jpg?v=1680975411\" alt /></span></p>\n<p><span>Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx) was a firm favourite for today's race after her </span>sensational Classics season so far.
