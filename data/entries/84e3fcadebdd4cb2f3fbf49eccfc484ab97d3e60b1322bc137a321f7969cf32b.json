In a further update, the leaker has now suggested we might yet see <a href=\"https://x.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1782646277525983293\">one more round</a> of <a href=\"https://x.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1782629715335151821\">FineWoven products</a> in a season of new colors before Apple finally says farewell to the material for good.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iPhone-15-Pro-FineWoven-feature.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nLast September, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-finewoven/\">stopped selling genuine leather accessories</a> in favor of a more environmentally friendly \"FineWoven\" material. The company describes FineWoven as \"luxurious and durable microtwill,\" and sells FineWoven iPhone cases at $59, MagSafe Wallets at $59, AirTag holders at $35, and Apple Watch bands at $99. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nMany customers consider FineWoven products to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apples-finewoven-iphone-cases-poor-reviews/\">subpar</a> compared to the leather Apple cases they replaced, and claim that the fabric is prone to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/finewoven-iphone-case-continued-criticism/\">scratches</a>, stains, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/26/finewoven-iphone-cases-brown-like-rotten-banana/\">discoloration</a>. If today's update is correct, Apple may have to brace itself for more unhappy FineWoven customers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKosutami is known for revealing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/09/new-apple-watch-magnetic-band/\">accurate information</a> about <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/finewoven-cases-may-match-new-watch-band/\">FineWoven accessories</a> in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/exclusive-first-look-finewoven-apple-watch-band/\">past</a>, so their latest claim should not be discounted. FineWoven accessories in new color options were absent from Apple's spring refresh, so perhaps their swan song could come in September when Apple releases the iPhone 16 lineup. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/\">Kosutami</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/finewoven/\">FineWoven</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/finewoven-accessories-may-get-one-last-season/\">FineWoven Accessories May Get One Last Outing Before Apple Pulls Plug</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/finewoven-accessories-may-get-one-last-outing-before-apple-pulls-plug.2424730/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"84e3fcadebdd4cb2f3fbf49eccfc484ab97d3e60b1322bc137a321f7969cf32b","category":"Apple"}
