Thanks to your outstanding participation, we hit our goal in the first week! With half of November still to go, our friends at SRAM generously offered to match our $5,000 donation if we can get 200 riders to ride 100 miles by the end of the month! That’s 100 miles total, not all at once. Silver Stallion is a small nonprofit bicycle recyclery based in Gallup, NM, serving Dinétah (the Navajo Nation) and the surrounding communities with a mission to empower and develop youth and young adult vocational skills in the bicycle repair and specialty coffee industries.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Find out how you can help out at <a href=\"https://ridespot.org/rides/464732\" target=\"_blank\">People for Bikes</a>!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2021/11/people-for-bikes-and-ride-spot-present-ride-for-gratitude-silver-stallion-century/\">People for Bikes and Ride Spot Present: Ride for Gratitude – Silver Stallion Century</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"9cd8d66a6005cbd00402ef0df5b88e97a72ab8cbb9fedb855887dd514365b321","category":"Cycling"}
