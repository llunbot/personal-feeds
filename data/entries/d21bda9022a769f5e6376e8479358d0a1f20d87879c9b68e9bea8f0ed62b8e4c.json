Keep reading to gain more control over when the Camera app opens.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-pro-capture-button.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nApple located the Camera Control button to make it conveniently placed for quick access, but it can sometimes be too responsive – especially during those moments when you're not actually trying to take a photo. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nRecognizing the potential for this, Apple in iOS 18.2 has added a new Require Screen On feature for Camera Control. It's particularly useful if you often find your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> accidentally opening the Camera app while it's in your pocket or bag. By requiring the screen to be on first, you can significantly reduce those unwanted camera launches while still maintaining quick access when you need it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Require Screen On for Camera Control</h2>\r<br />\nHere's how to enable the new option to prevent accidental Camera Control presses:\r<br />\n<ol>\r<br />\n  <li>Open the Settings app on your ‌iPhone 16‌.</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Display &amp; Brightness</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Look for the <strong>Camera Control</strong> section.</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Toggle on <strong>Require Screen On</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n</ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/require-screen-on-camera-control-ios.jpg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"2760\" height=\"2760\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOnce enabled, you'll need to wake your ‌iPhone‌'s screen before the Camera Control button will respond. This extra step adds just enough friction to prevent accidental activation while keeping the camera readily accessible when you need it.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/camera-control/\">Camera Control</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16\">iPhone 16 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro\">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/stop-accidental-camera-control-presses-iphone-16/\">iOS 18.2: End Accidental Camera Control Presses on iPhone 16</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-2-end-accidental-camera-control-presses-on-iphone-16.2445556/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d21bda9022a769f5e6376e8479358d0a1f20d87879c9b68e9bea8f0ed62b8e4c","category":"Apple"}
