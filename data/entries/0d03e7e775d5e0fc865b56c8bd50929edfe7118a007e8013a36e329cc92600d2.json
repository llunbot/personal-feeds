In those days just crossing the Channel was an adventure,’ recalls Hoban when <em>Cyclist</em> visits him in his cottage in Wales in early 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We went from Folkestone to Boulogne on the ferry. They dropped planks down and a bloke shouted, “Eh, lad! Get on quick!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘They were wobbling all over the place. When we got to France, we didn’t have a clue where to go. So we went into a petrol station, dug out a phrase book and said, “Monsieur, est-ce que vous avez une carte de la region?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We ended up in Arras and found Bertin who said, “The best club for you is Lapugnoy.” It was back near Bethune, 15 miles from Calais.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘When we got there, nobody spoke English. We met a guy at the World War I cemetery who we thought was French – he had stubble, a beret and a Gauloises in his mouth and they called him Andre – but it turned out his name was Andrew and he was from Nottingham.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221546/barry_hoban_profile_02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"barry_hoban_profile_02\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221546/barry_hoban_profile_02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221546/barry_hoban_profile_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221546/barry_hoban_profile_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221546/barry_hoban_profile_02-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221546/barry_hoban_profile_02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221546/barry_hoban_profile_02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221546/barry_hoban_profile_02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221546/barry_hoban_profile_02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221546/barry_hoban_profile_02.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘He became our interpreter. The boss said, “What races do you want to ride?” I said, “The ones with the most money.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘In 1962 executives earned £20 a week, Manchester United players earned £20 a week, but I was soon winning races with £50 prizes.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoban’s intrepid early years in France are testament to the particular blend of ambition, stubbornness and adaptability required by any British cyclist who wanted to pursue a career on the Continent in this era.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his first two years as an independent, Hoban endured humble digs, countless omelettes (the only item he recognised on menus), a brutal schedule (79 races in his first year) and the resentment of local cyclists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We [Brits] were a rarity. I was the first foreigner to do anything and they didn’t like it. One rider said, “Hey, Barry! You want to go back to England!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I said in my best French, “Excuse me, if it wasn’t for my father you’d be speaking German!” I would go for the jugular, me.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoban knew how to look after himself. ‘In one race all hell was let loose, the wind was blowing, and the riders wouldn’t let me into the echelon.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+5\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-5-970x300.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-5-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-5-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-5-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-5-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-5-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-5-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-5-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221550/barry_hoban_profile_03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"barry_hoban_profile_03\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221550/barry_hoban_profile_03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221550/barry_hoban_profile_03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221550/barry_hoban_profile_03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221550/barry_hoban_profile_03-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221550/barry_hoban_profile_03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221550/barry_hoban_profile_03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221550/barry_hoban_profile_03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221550/barry_hoban_profile_03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221550/barry_hoban_profile_03.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I shouted, “Right, you bastards, which ditch do you want – the right or the left? I’m going to take you all in!” One of the guys said, “Hey, Brit! All good! Come in!”’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Hoban’s indomitable Yorkshire spirit brought him the respect of his peers, it was his talent that earned him the right to stay. ‘I thought, I’ll give myself two years to get a pro contract or I’ll come home.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before leaving France he had worked as a trainee electrician at a coal mine. ‘I won 16 races in my first year and got 50 places in the top five.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The following year I won 20 races and got 60 places in the first five. So I was earning good money.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoban shows me a tattered diary in which he jotted down his results, winnings and race notes (‘I rode like an idiot today’) and practised scribbling his autograph in preparation for a pro career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a miraculous start for a young man from Wakefield who as a boy used to sell conkers and pick fruit for extra money. But cycling had always been his passion.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related

the 1950s the war had only just finished ten years ago and no one had a car. So a bike was a super way to get about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘My dad [Joe] was the biggest cycling supporter in the world and there were always bits of bike around so he put a bike together for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It was a track bike, no brakes, with cane sprints and D’Alessandro green tubs. It had street cred, but I didn’t realise you had to stick the tyres on until I was going down Stanley Hill and the back tyre came off.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Hoban turned 15 he began racing with the Calder Clarion club. ‘I couldn’t afford gears so I started primarily racing fixed-gear bikes on grass,’ he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1957 he upgraded to a road bike. ‘I was one of a group of juniors who dominated from Lincolnshire to Geordie land and across to Manchester and Yorkshire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘But you didn’t really think about being a pro because you didn’t get any insight into that world.

Hoban rode almost 50,000km in his first year, including the 2,860km Vuelta a Espana (then held in April and May), at which he claimed two stages, and the 4,504km Tour de France (the 2013 Tour was 3,404km).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His toughest single-day race in 1964 was Bordeaux-Paris at an obscene 550km.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The longest Tour I actually rode was 4,780km [in 1967] and the longest stage was Clermont-Ferrand to Fontainebleau at 359km [also in 1967] but that first year almost killed me,’ says Hoban, shaking his head.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221602/barry_hoban_profile_06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"barry_hoban_profile_06\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221602/barry_hoban_profile_06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221602/barry_hoban_profile_06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221602/barry_hoban_profile_06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221602/barry_hoban_profile_06-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221602/barry_hoban_profile_06-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221602/barry_hoban_profile_06-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221602/barry_hoban_profile_06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221602/barry_hoban_profile_06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221602/barry_hoban_profile_06.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It was stupid really. Nowadays you have three teams in one team [to share the events]. We were one team of 15 to 16 riders and we did everything: Paris-Nice, Milan-San Remo, Tour of Spain, Tour de France, Tour de Romandie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘At the Tour de France I was riding in the wind as a domestique for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cycling-stars-pay-tribute-to-the-late-raymond-poulidor\">Raymond Poulidor</a> and trying to take stages when I could.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We’d finish the Tour on the Sunday then ride criteriums on the Monday night, which carried on for 17 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I was averaging five hours sleep a night and driving 4,000km a week. It took me the whole second season to recover.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoban, who spent most of his career living in Ghent, was meticulous in his preparation and his peers say his vivacious character boosted team morale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He likens his riding style to that of Peter Sagan: ‘He can sprint but he isn’t the best sprinter. In my day you had to be multifaceted. I didn’t look for a sprint finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I won stages with breakaways, I won a mountain stage in the Alps on my own, and I won bunch sprints. You didn’t get riders waiting for a sprint like Cav.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/02181233/barry_hoban_profile_07-970x879.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Nowadays sprints are led out at 60kmh. In my day it was 50kmh and a pursuit rider could take sprinters by surprise.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was an era in which fancy kit was deemed a luxury. At best Hoban would have a silk jersey and longer cranks for a time-trial but otherwise hi-tech aerodynamics involved wearing his cap back to front.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You’d get a team bike but no saddle,’ he remembers. ‘Today’s bikes weigh less than my saddle with its steel bits, copper rivets and leather. We’d get a tracksuit and six pairs of shorts and jerseys. If we wanted more we bought them.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoban purchased his own socks, mitts and shoes. Back then, hydration involved tea with lemon and honey; race fuel was marzipan or strawberry jam sandwiches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘If you got a puncture and the cars were needed up front they’d hand you a pump and drive off.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Medical help was just as rudimentary, as Hoban recalls from a snowy 1964 edition of Paris-Nice. ‘We had no Gore-Tex, no overshoes, just wool. I got hypothermia. Nobody told me back then, but I now know the symptoms. I was “frigorific”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I got back to the hotel absolutely filthy, wrapped myself in a white bathrobe, got in bed and didn’t stop shivering for two hours.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/02181238/barry_hoban_profile_08-970x909.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 1967 Vuelta he contracted blood poisoning and an internal abscess on his crotch after crashing on a road caked in donkey excrement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The Spanish roads were all patched up – Franco was in power – and we always said that after going from Spain to Belgium the cobbles felt like tarmac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I went to A&amp;E and they had to lance the abscess and drain it of pus. The nurse got a wad with antiseptic lotion and stuffed it in. I was screaming in agony. I went to the Tour weeks later with a sponge down my shorts.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, Hoban’s first Tour de France stage win came in 1967 when, following the tragic death of Tom Simpson on stage 13 at <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mont-ventoux-cycling\">Mont Ventoux</a>, the peloton handed Hoban, as a fellow Brit, an honorary victory the next day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It was to commemorate Tom who was very popular so I don’t count that,’ says Hoban. His first authentic stage win came in 1968 with an epic breakaway during a 200km stage 19 from Grenoble to Sallanches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I won £900 that day – the prime, sprints, most combative rider, two first cat climbs, a special prime on the Colombière in honour of Henri Desgrange, and a cow for which they gave me the market value of about £200.’ Hoban still has the cowbell by his wood burner.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221605/barry_hoban_profile_09-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"barry_hoban_profile_09\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221605/barry_hoban_profile_09-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221605/barry_hoban_profile_09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221605/barry_hoban_profile_09-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221605/barry_hoban_profile_09-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221605/barry_hoban_profile_09-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221605/barry_hoban_profile_09-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221605/barry_hoban_profile_09-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221605/barry_hoban_profile_09-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221605/barry_hoban_profile_09.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the victory he most savours came on stage 18 of the 1969 Tour – a 201km route from Mourenx to the Bordeaux velodrome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his first Tour in 1964 Hoban had been cruelly denied a win in the same velodrome, also on stage 18, after French rival André Darrigade received a huge hand-sling from a teammate. Hoban wept uncontrollably.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That day a French fan, Christian Gourlay, was in the crowd and was so moved by Hoban’s raw passion that he began collecting cuttings of Hoban’s career with the fervent enthusiasm of a groupie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gourlay later met Hoban at an event and presented him with more than ten files packed with cuttings, pictures and stats (in 12 editions of the Tour Hoban apparently rode 46,172km over 1,296 hours) – a remarkable gift for which he has been grateful ever since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoban shows me a photo of his victory in the Bordeaux velodrome in 1969. ‘It felt like revenge after 1964,’ he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221609/barry_hoban_profile_10-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"barry_hoban_profile_10\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221609/barry_hoban_profile_10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221609/barry_hoban_profile_10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221609/barry_hoban_profile_10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221609/barry_hoban_profile_10-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221609/barry_hoban_profile_10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221609/barry_hoban_profile_10-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221609/barry_hoban_profile_10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221609/barry_hoban_profile_10-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221609/barry_hoban_profile_10.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I remember saying to Francis Rigon: “I’ll cross your palm with silver.

He helped Simpson during his 1965 World Championships win, they were British teammates during the fateful 1967 Tour, and Hoban would later marry Simpson’s widow, Helen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I wasn’t a close friend of Tom but we Brits were few and far between,’ says Hoban. ‘If I could have beaten Tom I would have but we respected each other.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He recalls riding past Simpson moments after he had collapsed on Mont Ventoux. ‘I thought, “The idiot has had a bit of sunstroke. Nutter.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You just couldn’t think what was happening. I got to the hotel and said, “Is Tom back yet?” The soigneurs knew but kept it from us until later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘When I woke up in the morning I thought, “I had a horrible nightmare that Tom died.” Slowly I thought, “Shit, it wasn’t a nightmare.”’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoban believes Simpson’s death was a preventable tragedy. ‘The Tour de France organisation at that time ran with the hare and the hounds,’ he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘There were things they did that weren’t ethical. But [Félix] Lévitan [co-organiser of the Tour] was a bit of a dictator, like a godfather from the Mafia, and [Pierre] Dumas was an excuse for a doctor and stank of whisky all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221613/barry_hoban_profile_12-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"barry_hoban_profile_12\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221613/barry_hoban_profile_12-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221613/barry_hoban_profile_12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221613/barry_hoban_profile_12-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221613/barry_hoban_profile_12-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221613/barry_hoban_profile_12-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221613/barry_hoban_profile_12-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221613/barry_hoban_profile_12-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221613/barry_hoban_profile_12-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221613/barry_hoban_profile_12.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘When Tom died, Lévitan more or less said, “Two things can happen here.

But amphetamines didn’t kill you.

They should have been able to resuscitate him. They didn’t have the appropriate stuff. It was mouth to mouth, but in those days that’s how things were.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoban believes that in his era a universal ignorance about drugs was part of the problem. ‘The medical profession opened Pandora’s Box,’ he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I remember after Helen was pregnant the gynaecologist prescribed a slow-release amphetamine used for slimming. I said, “You’re not taking that!” People didn’t understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘People would drive to the south of France on holiday, leave at 4am on Friday morning and take amphetamines with coffee.

I reminded them it was 33 years since I stopped racing. But I’m grateful.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did he ever expect to see the Tour come to the county he left back in 1962? ‘No, no, no,’ he laughs. ‘But I was delighted.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoban was in Harrogate to witness the finish of Stage 1. ‘In France Barry Hoban would be supreme guest of honour,’ he chuckles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thumbing through his scrapbooks, Hoban recalls his old cycling haunts in Yorkshire – Bullerthorpe Lane, Denby Dale, Penistone, Holme Moss, Woodhead – many of which featured in the Grand Départ 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/02181251/barry_hoban_profile_14-970x940.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘There’s always been a good tough sporting spirit in Yorkshire.

We really did cycle everywhere…’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoban’s voice trails off. ‘But that’s the thing about cycling in Yorkshire,’ he resumes, flashing the same grin that lit up the Bordeaux velodrome in 1969. ‘It’s always a big adventure.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Barry’s best bits </h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Three highlights from Hoban’s pro career</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>1968 Tour de France, Stage 19</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It was a 200km mountain stage from Grenoble to Sallanches. I got away and had a four-minute lead. By the bottom of the Colombière I had an eight-minute lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Julio Jiménez, Arie den Hartog and Silvano Schiavon were taking a minute on the climbs but I was taking it back on the descents. On the last climb I said, “Right, Hoban, no heroics,” and used the lowest gear possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I finished with a four-minute lead. I’d been on my own for 135km.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>1969 Tour de France, Stage 18</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Bordeaux was definitely best for me because it was a hell of a deception when I was beaten there in 1964 by André Darrigade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘He pinched it off me when he got a big hand-sling, so going back and winning in the velodrome was fantastic. You’d get 30,000 spectators. I ended up with two firsts, two seconds and a third on the Bordeaux track.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>1974 Gent-Wevelgem</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I was a big fan of the Classics – it’s not a Monument but it was a long race [244km] and I beat Eddy Merckx.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘On the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/kemmelberg-cycling\">Kemmel</a> it was like being on the end of a piece of elastic. I lost touch but kept getting back on. I was boxed in at the finish but a gap opened up and I went through, past Merckx and Roger De Vlaeminck, and won.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221622/barry_hoban_profile_16-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"barry_hoban_profile_16\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221622/barry_hoban_profile_16-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221622/barry_hoban_profile_16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221622/barry_hoban_profile_16-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221622/barry_hoban_profile_16-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221622/barry_hoban_profile_16-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221622/barry_hoban_profile_16-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221622/barry_hoban_profile_16-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221622/barry_hoban_profile_16-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/04221622/barry_hoban_profile_16.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hoban on:</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>…The 1974 Tour de France stage in Britain</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I remember the Tour coming to Plymouth in 1974 but it was a debacle. They flew us into Exeter from a military airbase in Brittany and when we arrived they wondered who we all were.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘They locked us in a boiling hot room. When we eventually got out, unlike in France where the gendarmes escorted us, the police did nothing so we were stuck in traffic. The race was held on Plympton bypass – ten laps around a bypass. Diabolical.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>…Tom Simpson’s 1965 World Road Race win</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We were lone rangers. There was no team. I was used to the way riders ride in Spain [the race was in the Basque Country].</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘They attack at the start so I went with them. Tom joined up afterwards. I wasn’t in good form so I said to Tom, “What do you want me to do?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘He said, “Just keep the pace high.” I did that, much like the Sky guys do. Then Tom countered and sorted it out with Rudi Altig.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>…Drugs in cycling</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>‘When money is around, guys will take a shortcut. Lance earned the most and it cost him the most. When people start hammering cyclists I get on my soapbox and say, “Hey, look at other sports.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I don’t think top riders would [take drugs] today but certain riders will dabble just to work as a team rider. Remember when the riders went on strike about helmets, now they all wear them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s the same with this: guys brought up [clean] from junior and amateur days will stay like that.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article was originally featured in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\">Cyclist magazine</a> issue 21 in 2014.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/yorkshire-gold-barry-hoban-profile\">Yorkshire gold: Remembering Barry Hoban 1940-2025</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"0d03e7e775d5e0fc865b56c8bd50929edfe7118a007e8013a36e329cc92600d2","category":"Cycling"}
