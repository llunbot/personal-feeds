In a tweet, Gurman said that \"signs are increasingly pointing to September 12,\" which would line up with the timing of past <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> events.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nIn his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-08-06/apple-iphone-15-comes-amid-us-sales-slowdown-tim-cook-q3-earnings-comments-lkzfs14u\">Power On newsletter</a> shared <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/06/iphone-15-event-september-12-or-13/\">over the weekend</a>, Gurman had suggested September 12 or September 13 as two potential dates for the event, but now it sounds like Tuesday is the more probable candidate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's fall ‌iPhone‌ events are usually held during the first two weeks of September, and often take place on a Tuesday. Launching in early September allows Apple to push ‌iPhone‌ sales ahead of the end of the fiscal quarter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Signs are increasingly pointing to Sept. 12 as the iPhone 15 event date, but obviously things can still theoretically change. <a href=\"https://t.co/hVKgjJGMc1\">https://t.co/hVKgjJGMc1</a></p>— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1689056881837592576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 8, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nIf the ‌iPhone 15‌ models are unveiled on September 12 and Apple sticks to its usual debut timing, pre-orders will take place on Friday, September 15, and a launch will follow on Friday, September 22.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe are expecting Apple to introduce four new ‌iPhone‌ models, including the ‌iPhone 15‌, ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a> is expected to expand to all ‌iPhone 15‌ models, plus Apple will adopt USB-C for charging instead of Lightning. Most other changes will be limited to the Pro models, with those set to feature slimmer bezels, a faster A17 chip, new camera technology, and more, as outlined in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> roundups.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe fall event should also see the debut of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra</a>, and shortly after the event, we'll see the launch of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a>, tvOS 17, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/\">watchOS 10</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/08/iphone-15-september-12-event/\">Apple's iPhone 15 Event Likely to Be Held on September 12</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-iphone-15-event-likely-to-be-held-on-september-12.2398127/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3553ad09eeec3dac1f69248cce3ed2d3924a21d6769092ef90cc0d5c0f6bc8fc","category":"Apple"}
