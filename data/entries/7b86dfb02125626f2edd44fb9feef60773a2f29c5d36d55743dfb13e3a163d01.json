To achieve this, the company has successfully reduced the display driver integrated circuit (IC) from 28nm to 16nm—a significant advancement. This may help prolong battery life.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/apple-foldables-mass-production-2026/\">According to analyst Jeff Pu</a>, Apple's first foldable recently entered the New Product Introduction (NPI) phase at Foxconn,  with mass production slated to begin in the second half of 2026. Reports suggest Apple could launch the device either late next year or in early 2027.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Weibo user has a number of accurate previous claims, including that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 7 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2015/09/28/iphone-7-already-rumored-to-be-waterproof/\">would be water-resistant</a>, the standard ‌iPhone‌ 14 models would continue using the A15 Bionic chip (with the more advanced A16 chip being exclusive to the ‌iPhone‌ 14 Pro models), and Apple would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-developing-its-own-ai-server-processor/\">build servers</a> to support <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> using <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a> hardware. These predictions were later corroborated by multiple credible sources and subsequently proven to be correct. \r<br />\n<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phone-chip-expert/\">Phone Chip Expert</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/18/apple-prioritizing-foldable-display-efficiency/\">Apple Prioritizing Foldable Display Efficiency to Boost Battery Life</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-prioritizing-foldable-display-efficiency-to-boost-battery-life.2453404/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7b86dfb02125626f2edd44fb9feef60773a2f29c5d36d55743dfb13e3a163d01","category":"Apple"}
