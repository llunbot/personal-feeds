{"title":"'Apple Pencil Pro' Referenced in Code on Apple's Website in Japan","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-pencil-pro/","date":1715008141000,"content":"A reference to an unreleased \"Apple Pencil Pro\" has been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ribu_ap712/status/1787461116211479032\">spotted in the source code</a> for Apple's homepage in Japan. We have independently confirmed that the code exists, but it would be unsurprising if Apple removes it after it was discovered.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-Pencil-on-iPad-Close.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThis finding suggests that an Apple Pencil Pro could be announced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-let-loose-apple-event-may-7/\">at the Apple Event tomorrow</a>. However, given the code does not appear on Apple's homepage in the U.S. or other countries, there is a chance that the Japanese website made a translation error.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA computer translation of the source code:<blockquote>Folded green, yellow, orange and blue paper forms the Apple logo. Inside the logo, you can see the creator's hand holding the Apple Pencil Pro and drawing.</blockquote>Regardless of whether the Apple Pencil Pro name is used, a new Apple Pencil is expected to be announced at the Apple Event. Rumored features include a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ios-17-5-apple-pencil-4-rumor/\">new \"squeeze\" gesture</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/28/ipad-pro-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-haptic-rumors/\">haptic feedback</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/apple-pencil-visionon-support-in-testing/\">Vision Pro support is also a possibility</a> by visionOS 2.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is likely that the Apple Pencil Pro would replace the second-generation Apple Pencil, released in 2018. Other models available include the Apple Pencil with USB-C, and the original Apple Pencil from 2015, which is expected to be discontinued once Apple stops selling the ninth-generation iPad with a Lightning connector.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther products expected to be announced at the Apple Event include <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/28/ipad-pro-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-haptic-rumors/\">two new iPad Pro models with Apple's next-generation M4 chip</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/12/larger-ipad-air-launching-early-2024/\">a larger 12.9-inch iPad Air</a> to go along with an updated 10.9-inch model, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/\">redesigned Magic Keyboard for iPads</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139\">iPad Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-pencil-pro/\">'Apple Pencil Pro' Referenced in Code on Apple's Website in Japan</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pencil-pro-referenced-in-code-on-apples-website-in-japan.2425538/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cbc20735e0a03408f97b3c760623a71a74e8fc9fcbfbfef445f7bc5a0c4834ba","category":"Apple"}
