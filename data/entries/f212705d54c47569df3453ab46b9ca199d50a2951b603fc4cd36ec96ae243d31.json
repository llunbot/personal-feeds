The lenses were \"pre-assembled.\" Now, Apple is consolidating the production of its camera modules to its largest supplier, Foxconn, to save costs.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Up to last year, Apple has procured double and triple camera modules from its suppliers LG InnoTek, Sharp, and O'Film that are pre-assembled.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBut it is now procuring these camera modules individually and gave the job of assembly to Foxconn. The measure is being done to save cost.</blockquote>Foxconn, in preparation for its new camera assembly responsibility, has received new inspection equipment from the South Korean firm Hyvision System. The new system will check whether the wide, Ultra Wide, and Telephoto cameras' lenses, including their optical axis and image sensors, are correctly aligned on higher-end ‌iPhone‌ models. An incorrect alignment could result in drastically reduced image quality.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new changes are being done to \"save costs,\" but it remains unclear if those savings would be presented to customers. It's also unclear whether the new production methodology and Foxconn's role in camera assembly will be in practice for the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>. Given that the new iPhones are already in production, that's unlikely to be the case.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-elec/\">The Elec</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/12/new-iphone-camera-assembly-method/\">Apple Reportedly Using New Method to Assemble iPhone Cameras in Effort to Save Costs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-using-new-method-to-assemble-iphone-cameras-in-effort-to-save-costs.2307318/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gWpHFTEV15s:6iH7zpMzGbI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gWpHFTEV15s:6iH7zpMzGbI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/gWpHFTEV15s\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f212705d54c47569df3453ab46b9ca199d50a2951b603fc4cd36ec96ae243d31","category":"Apple"}
