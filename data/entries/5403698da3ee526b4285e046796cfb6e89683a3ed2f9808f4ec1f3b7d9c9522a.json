That also compares favorably to last years ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max, which scored 2,546 and 66,31 points in the same respective tests.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Geekbench results also recorded 8GB of RAM for both ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ models, compared to 6GB of RAM in last year's Pro models, corroborating <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-models-have-8gb-ram/\">previous reporting</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's A17 Pro chip is made with a first-of-its-kind 3-nanometer process. The A17 Pro has a six-core CPU, for 10% faster CPU performance and 20% faster GPU performance. It also has a two-times faster 16-core neural engine to accelerate machine learning such as more accurate autocorrect or pulling a subject from an image. It can process up to 35 trillion operations per second.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, the A17 Pro contains a brand new GPU with an Apple-designed shader architecture. Apple says it is the biggest redesign in the history of Apple GPUs, with a focus on performance and efficiency, running complex applications, and new rendering features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌‌iPhone 15 Pro‌‌ starts at $999 for 128GB of storage, while the ‌‌iPhone 15 Pro‌‌ Max starts at $1,199 for 256GB of storage.
