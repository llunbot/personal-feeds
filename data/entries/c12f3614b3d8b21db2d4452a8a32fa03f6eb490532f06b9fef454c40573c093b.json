But this month has seen a succession of more and more plausible reports that suggest the iPhone Fold project is finally happening, even if a launch remains a couple of years away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Near the start of March, the respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo outlined his expectations for the device–ultra-thin, folding in the book style rather than a clamshell, with a crease-free screen and a $2,000-plus price tag. Then Mark Gurman revealed that the iPhone 17 Air expected to launch this fall will act as a trial run leading to major iPhone redesign plans, including the ability to fold, if it’s successful. Finally, a Barclays analyst narrowed pricing expectations to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2640739/apples-first-foldable-iphone-could-cost-more-than-the-priciest-ipad-pro.html\">around $2,300</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the most interesting rumor arrived last week. We were back to Kuo, who this time predicted that the iPhone Fold would have a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2645516/the-folding-iphones-killer-feature-might-be-a-liquidmetal-hinge.html\">hinge made of LiquidMetal</a>. (Not literally metal in its liquid form, but the marketing term for a material that uses a special casting process to produce exceptionally strong, hard, and precise metal parts.) This seemed especially plausible because Apple purchased worldwide exclusive rights to use material developed by a related company named LiquidMetal 15 years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rumor train shows no sign of stopping, and the well-known and prolific Weibo leaker Instant Digital posted a <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5143897135/Pkvb9FIcN\">message</a> Thursday (via <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/27/iphone-fold-features-metallic-glass-hinge/\">MacRumors</a>) offering further details of the hinge mechanism Apple is working on for its first foldable iPhone. The hinge will be made of “amorphous alloy (metallic glass),” the leaker said, metallic glass being another term for liquid metal, before adding explanations of why such a material would be chosen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Advantages,” Instant began. “Amorphous particle structure, better resistance to bending, deformation, and dents, strength and hardness are 2.5 times higher than titanium alloy, and glossiness is also better (basically close to the high-end feeling of stainless steel that you like).” All very appealing. But in response to a question in the comments about whether screen creases (one of the main issues with current folding phones) can disappear with the use of this material, the leaker simply says “impossible.” So we’ll have to wait to see how Apple solves that, which is said to be a priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t currently expect the iPhone Fold to launch until 2027.
