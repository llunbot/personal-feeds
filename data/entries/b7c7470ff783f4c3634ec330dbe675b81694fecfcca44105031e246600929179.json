Greg Brockman, the company's president and co-founder, is taking an extended sabbatical until the end of the year, while another co-founder, John Schulman, permanently <a href=\"https://x.com/johnschulman2/status/1820610863499509855\">departed</a> for rival Anthropic. Peter Deng, VP of Consumer Product, has <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/trio-of-leaders-leave-openai\">also left</a> the ChatGPT maker.</p>\n\n<p>In a post on X, Brockman <a href=\"https://x.com/gdb/status/1820644694264791459\">wrote</a>, \"I'm taking a sabbatical through end of year.

As AI developer Benjamin De Kraker <a href=\"https://x.com/BenjaminDEKR/status/1820633405244969250\">put it</a> on X, \"If OpenAI is right on the verge of AGI, why do prominent people keep leaving?\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041450#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041450&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b7c7470ff783f4c3634ec330dbe675b81694fecfcca44105031e246600929179","category":"Tech"}
