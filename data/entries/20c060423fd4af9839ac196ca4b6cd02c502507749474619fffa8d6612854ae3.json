Early this morning, a suspected arson attack on a nearby electrical transformer led to the factory's evacuation, <a href=\"https://www.bz-berlin.de/brandenburg/brand-anschlag-kein-strom-bei-tesla-und-in-berlin\">according to the German publication BZ</a>. The fire has also left parts of Berlin and towns in Brandenburg without power.</p>\n<p>According to BZ, the transformer fire happened at 4:50 am CET, with Tesla's factory losing power an hour before the start of today's shift. Other companies based at the industrial estate next to the Tesla factory have also had to suspend work.</p>\n<p>The fire brigade and power company's work to restore power was slowed by the discovery of a tent apparently occupied by climate activists <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/musk-accused-polluting-german-rivers-132031339.html\">protesting water pollution at Tesla's factory</a>, as well as a planned expansion of the site. A sign warning of unexploded ordnance resulted in the first responders calling in the bomb squad.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007816#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007816&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
