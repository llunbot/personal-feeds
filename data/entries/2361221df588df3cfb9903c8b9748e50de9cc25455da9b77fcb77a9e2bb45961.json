It’s a bit heavier than some, but it is extremely comfortable, and we’d argue it’s worth the price tag.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/helmets/mountain-biking-helmets/troy-lee-designs-a3-helmet-review/\">Read our full Troy Lee Designs A3 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Troy Lee Designs Flowline MIPS helmet review</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Flowline MIPS uses a plastic shell with full wrap-in-mould construction.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£100 as tested</li>\n<li>Impressive comfort and fit</li>\n<li>Sleek style at a great price</li>\n<li>MIPS liner can be a bit noisy</li>\n</ul><p>A sharp and sleek design makes this helmet a lot less bulky than others, and the well-placed padding ensures the Flowline is comfortable on long rides.</p>\n<p>The ventilation works well, with our tester finding the removable pads worked well in soaking up sweat.</p>\n<p>The Flowline is compatible with many riding glasses, with the helmet’s straps sitting comfortably over their arms and space under the peak to store them.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/helmets/mountain-bike-helmets/troy-lee-designs-flowline-mips-helmet-review/\">Read our full Troy Lee Designs Flowline MIPS helmet review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Bell Super Air Spherical</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Bell Super Air Spherical doesn’t come cheap but offers high levels of comfort.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£224.95 as tested</li>\n<li>Top-tier comfort levels</li>\n<li>Premium build quality</li>\n<li>Peak needs some refinement</li>\n</ul><p>The Bell Super Air Spherical uses two layers of EPS foam for impact protection, with the outer layer being denser to take the sting out of high-speed impacts.</p>\n<p>Our tester found the Ionic+ padding and 360-degree retention system kept the helmet comfy on long days out.</p>\n<p>With 17 vents, the helmet also works well at cooling your head – though not all vents penetrate through the inner EPS layer.</p>\n<p>The helmet can be converted into a lightweight full-face helmet with the purchase of an £89.99 chin bar.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/helmets/mountain-bike-helmets/bell-super-air-spherical-helmet-review/\">Read our full Bell Super Air Spherical review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>B’Twin All Mountain</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The lid’s big ear cut-outs could polarise opinion.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£29.99 / €40 as tested</li>\n<li>Good on-head stability and comfortable</li>\n<li>Bargain price and good head coverage</li>\n<li>Can get quite hot on long climbs</li>\n</ul><p>For the price, the B’Twin All Mountain is an impressive lid, offering plenty of coverage, staying comfortable on long rides and refusing to budge over rough terrain.</p>\n<p>It’s compatible with plenty of riding glasses, but lacks an adjustable retention cradle seen on most other lids.

This is known as in-moulding and provides protection against minor bumps and scratches that would otherwise damage the EPS.</p>\n<p>On cheaper helmets, this tends to be limited to the top and sides of the helmet. More expensive, fully in-moulded helmets extend the plastic protection down and around the rim, making it much more effective at fending off damage.</p>\n<h3>Ventilation</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The low weight is thanks to, in part at least, the 23 vents and deep internal channelling.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>While the extra coverage of trail-style helmets is more than welcome, it does get in the way of airflow, which can mean a much warmer and sweatier head in hot weather or when you’re pushing really hard.</p>\n<p>Happily, thanks to the increasingly clever use of materials and design, it’s now possible to make a lid that’s almost as cool as a conventional design.</p>\n<p>Having lots of vents is important, but it’s the internal channels that help airflow in through the front, over the head and out the back that makes all the difference.</p>\n<p>Look for big vents on the front and rear, with deep channels on the inside of the lid.</p>\n<h3>Comfort</h3>\n<p>How well a helmet fits will depend on the size and shape of your head. Many people tend to get on with certain brands that use a particular shape, but finding the right one is very much a case of trial and error.</p>\n<p>If possible, go to your local bike shop to see how you get on with different lids or ask your friends if you can try theirs.<span><br /></span></p>\n<p>The main thing is to ensure you can get the helmet sitting securely on your head so there are no pressure points or undue movement.</p>\n<p>Most helmets will have a retention system of some kind to allow you to adjust how tightly it fits onto your head. Many of these will tighten and loosen around the circumference of the head, although some also adjust in other ways.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s a generous amount of padding in this helmet for comfort and to absorb sweat when you’re working hard.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robin Weaver</i></span></div>\n<p>However it works, make sure you can operate the system easily in gloves and that it doesn’t trap hair or pinch flesh.</p>\n<p>Also ensure that you can adjust the straps to get a solid fit that’s not restrictive and that when fully adjusted you have a clear, unobstructed view, especially when you’re in an aggressive, head-down riding position.</p>\n<p>Check that the peak can be adjusted so that it keeps the sun out of your eyes without getting in the way or flapping about when you ride. If you like to ride wearing <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-sunglasses/\">sunglasses for mountain biking</a>, make sure they fit comfortably with the lid.</p>\n<h3>Weight</h3>\n<p>While weight might seem like a minor consideration compared with a helmet’s other characteristics, a lightweight helmet will be a much more pleasant place to be after a long day on the bike.</p>\n<p>A light lid is much less likely to move about as you ride, too.</p>\n<h3>Convertibility</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some helmets, such as the Switchblade, have removable chin bars.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A number of helmets on the market now come with a chin guard that can be removed. This is largely in response to the growth in enduro racing, where long climbs benefit from an open-face lid to help you breathe and stay cool, while gnarly descents mean the additional protection from a full-face-style lid is desirable.</p>\n<p>With a removable chin guard, riders get the best of both worlds.</p>\n<div>\n<p>The compromise is often weight because, if the helmet has full ASTM downhill certification (so it can be used as a DH race helmet), there needs to be extra protection built in. Not all of the convertible helmets meet this standard, though.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> In open-face mode, the amount of coverage coupled with the MIPS liner should keep your head well protected.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Whether you choose a convertible helmet is up to you, but we’re definitely seeing more on the trails these days.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Anything else I might need to know?</h3>\n<p>If you love to record and share your rides online, then you’ll be pleased to know that more and more manufacturers are integrating removable camera mounts into their helmets.</p>\n<p>These allow a secure fitting for your camera, but also mean you can go back to having an unfettered helmet when you want to.</p>\n<p>Many enduro-style lids also allow you to use <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-goggles/\">mountain bike goggles</a> to provide almost impregnable eye protection. Look for helmets with a peak that lifts up high enough for you to be able to fit the goggles underneath and a strap of some kind at the back to keep them secure</p>","author":"Alex Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"2361221df588df3cfb9903c8b9748e50de9cc25455da9b77fcb77a9e2bb45961","category":"Cycling"}
