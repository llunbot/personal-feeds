Being alkaline, it counteracts rising acidity levels in the muscles, which cause fatigue during intense exercise.</p>\n<p>Sodium bicarbonate (also called baking soda or bicarbonate of soda) is typically consumed dissolved in water or in the form of capsules.</p>\n<p>But not without potentially disastrous gastrointestinal (GI) consequences – think skin-suited track sprinters rushing to the toilet minutes before the start of a race.</p>\n<p>Now Maurten has devised a new way of ingesting bicarb. A gel coating helps tiny bicarbonate capsules pass into the intestine. Bicarbonate in the form of solution and, to a lesser extent, standard capsules tends to break down in the stomach, triggering GI issues.</p>\n<p>The sports nutrition brand says its Maurten Bicarb System, used by <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/worldtour-bikes/\">WorldTour teams</a>, eliminates GI upset in most athletes while improving performance.</p>\n<p>Maurten claims the Bicarb System’s effectiveness extends beyond explosive cycling events, where bicarbonate’s benefit is well established, into four-to-five hour road races.</p>\n<p>Do Maurten’s claims stand up to scientific scrutiny? Can bicarb make me go faster, not just to the toilet?</p>\n<p>I participated in the first independent trial of the new product by the City of Birmingham University to find out.</p>\n<p>I asked sports nutritionist Ellen McDermott, from <a href=\"https://www.mcdnutrition.com/nutritioncoaching\" target=\"_blank\">McD Nutrition</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.highnorth.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">High North </a>Performance coaching’s Dr Emma Wilkins and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/tombell/\">Tom Bell</a> for their interpretation of the study results.</p>\n<h2>How does sodium bicarbonate improve performance in high-intensity exercise?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Package of Maurten Bicarb System with Wattbike in background\" title=\"CZ1_9910\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> With the Bicarb System, Maurten aims to make bicarbonate easier to stomach but still performance-enhancing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Chris Teagles</i></span></div>\n<p>Maurten’s head of nutrition Tobias Christensson says: “It’s been known for decades that bicarbonate works.</p>\n<p>“It rests on very solid scientific evidence that if you ingest bicarbonate, you can increase the acid base balance, or you can have a higher alkalosis or you increase your buffering capacity.”</p>\n<p>Your buffering capacity is your ability to flush away metabolic waste products that muscles produce at a faster rate during intense efforts (zone 5 and above of your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/training-zones/\">training zones</a>).</p>\n<p>Eventually, these by-products of anaerobic energy production can no longer be buffered by the blood quicker than the muscles produce them.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jack Evans doing 4km time trial in bicarb study\" title=\"CZ1_9581\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> By flushing fatiguing metabolites from the muscles, bicarb can help you ride at a high intensity for longer.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Chris Teagles</i></span></div>\n<p>Their build-up (not of lactate, which can be used as fuel) causes metabolic acidosis (excessive acid levels, which impair the muscles’ ability to contract). This contributes to fatigue and then exhaustion within three to eight minutes of all-out effort.</p>\n<p>For sodium bicarbonate to work, blood bicarbonate (HCO3-) must rise to neutralise acidic hydrogen ions (H+), and maintain muscle pH.</p>\n<p>Delayed muscle acidosis enables you to produce a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-train-with-power/\">higher power output</a> for longer.</p>\n<p>Ellen McDermott says: “Reviews and studies have shown that there are performance benefits of bicarbonate in durations from 30 seconds up to 12 minutes.”</p>\n<p>Dr Emma Wilkins and Tom Bell say the athletes they coach have occasionally used sodium bicarbonate for its performance-enhancing effects. And Bell, a UK National Hill Climb Champion, has used it himself.</p>\n<h2>What is the Maurten Bicarb System?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Maurten Bicarb System being mixed together\" title=\"CZ1_9902\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The micro capsules combine with the hydrogel in the mixing bowl.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Chris Teagles</i></span></div>\n<p>The commercially available Maurten Bicarb System consists of a mixing bowl, hydrogel (containing 40g of carbohydrate) and bicarbonate.</p>\n<p>The price varies according to the dosage required. For example, a medium dose for a 75kg athlete costs £60/$65/€64.40 for four servings. Maurten recommends one serving per training session or race.</p>\n<p>To consume, you mix the hydrogel and tiny bicarbonate tablets together in the bowl. You then eat the contents, ensuring you swallow the tablets whole.</p>\n<h2>How does the Maurten Bicarb System work?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jack Evans tucks into a bowl of bicarb\" title=\"CZ1_9928\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The small capsules are designed to pass into the intestine and not react with gastric acid in the stomach.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Chris Teagles</i></span></div>\n<p>According to Christensson, Maurten started developing the Bicarb System in 2020.</p>\n<p>The goal was to capture the performance-enhancing effect of bicarbonate in a form more people’s stomachs could tolerate.</p>\n<p>Its scientists used the brand’s existing Hydrogel technology, which it claims enhances carbohydrate absorption from its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/nutrition/best-energy-gels-for-cycling/\">energy gels</a> and drinks, and mimicked drug delivery techniques from the pharmaceutical industry.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Carbohydrate sachet being poured into bowl of bicarbonate and hydrogel\" title=\"CZ1_9875\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The addition of carbohydrate aids absorption of the bicarbonate.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Chris Teagles </i></span></div>\n<p>The result, Christensson says, was “a much more sophisticated delivery system of bicarbonate than existing methods”.</p>\n<p>Bicarbonate capsules often break down before they pass out of the stomach into their desired destination of the intestine.</p>\n<p>Christensson says: “The hydrogel works as a vehicle or a delivery method, which protects the mini tablets from getting exposed to the gastric acid in the stomach.”</p>\n<p>Maurten also claims the tablets’ small size slows down the release of bicarbonate in the intestine, lowering the risk of stomach upset and prolonging the supplement’s effect.</p>\n<h2>Who uses the Maurten Bicarb System?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"ORIHUELA, SPAIN - MAY 02: (L-R) Eva Van Agt of The Netherlands, Noemi Rüegg of Switzerland, Coryn Labecki of The United States, Marianne Vos of The Netherlands - Polka dot Mountain Jersey, Amber Kraak of The Netherlands - Green points jersey, Riejanne Markus of The Netherlands - White most combative rider jersey and Anna Henderson of United Kingdom and Team Jumbo-Visma - Red Leader Jersey prior to the 9th La Vuelta Femenina 2023, Stage 2 a 105.8km stage from Orihuela to Pilar de la Horadada / #UCIWWT / on May 02, 2023 in Orihuela, Spain.

So nothing as bad as some of my fellow participants.</p>\n<p>The trial controlled for many external factors, such as freshness and fuelling, but the possibility remains I was on a better day when I took the Maurten Bicarb System.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jack Evans having blood test taken during sodium bicarbonate trial in laboratory\" title=\"CZ1_9450\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Blood lactate testing suggested I was able to tolerate a higher intensity after taking the Bicarb System.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Chris Teagles </i></span></div>\n<p>I felt as fantastic as you can during two all-out 4km time trials.

Quite the opposite.</p>\n<p>But I’m a club-standard rider and I only race occasionally in hill climbs, time trials and cyclocross.</p>\n<p>So I’m definitely not Maurten’s target market with the Bicarb System.</p>\n<p>And if I did want to use bicarbonate before competition, I could probably do so with ordinary capsules, which didn’t cause me gastric distress.</p>\n<p>However, the experience of eating 20 or so paracetamol-sized capsules washed down by a pint of water isn’t that pleasant.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jack Evans eating bicarb in laboratory\" title=\"CZ1_9939\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> I could stand to gain a lot from ingesting bicarb before races.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Chris Teagles </i></span></div>\n<p>The texture and taste of the Maurten Bicarb System most resembles chia pudding.
