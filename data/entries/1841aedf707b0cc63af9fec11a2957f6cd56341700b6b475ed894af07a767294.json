In addition to the midsize Mach-E crossover, it created a fully electric version of its best-selling F-150 pickup truck and an electric E-Transit van.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044465#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044465&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
