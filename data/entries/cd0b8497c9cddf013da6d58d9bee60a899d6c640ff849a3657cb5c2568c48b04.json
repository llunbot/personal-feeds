The UK brand just announced the latest version, 3.0 with a few updates. Let’s check it out…</em><span></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-08.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-08.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-08.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-08.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Faran chassis has undergone a series of refinements for version 3. Find them in a list below:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-02.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-02.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>A Reynolds 725 front triangle with custom butting profiles. Reynolds 725 DZB downtube and a new 28.6mm top tube, ovalized to 25 × 32mm, for increased stability when carrying a front load.</p>\n<p>The Faran 3.0 gets the same rear triangle as the Secan 3.0. Heavily curved and flattened stays to maximize compliance. Unique to Fairlight.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-04.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-04.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Increased tire clearance. Now compatible with up to 700 x 53mm and up to 62mm in 650B/27.5”.</p>\n<p>Fairlight x Bentley Mk3 dropouts featuring a removable cable stop. Direct mount, standard hanger, and T-Type inserts. The disc side insert is now 160/180mm.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-06.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-06.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-06.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-06.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>New Faran 3.0 fork. 160/180mm brake mount. We re-analyzed all the boss and braze-on locations and re-positioned them to offer a better fit with a wider variety of racks and cages. New mudguard/fender plate integrated into the base of the crown.</p>\n<p>The downtube brake hose clips are now CNC-machined modular parts.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-05.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-05.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-05.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-05.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-03.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-03.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Dropper post compatible with 1x set-ups. We do a double-hose version of our new CNC downtube clips. There is a dropper exit port on the back of the seat tube.</p>\n<p>3D-printed bottom bracket cable guide for mechanical gear set-ups. We have made one part do several jobs; as well as guiding the front and rear derailleur cables, it also acts as a guide for the brake hose, dropper post hose, and the dynamo rear light wire. Ultra utility – everything in its place.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-07.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-07.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-07.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Fairlight_Faran-3-07.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Geometry – Small refinements. The chain stay length has increased by 2mm (430mm to 432mm) to add space for the larger 700c tyres. Head angle and fork offset have NOT changed – keeps the same mid-low trail geometry as the Mk2.0/2.5. Small adjustments to the stack and reach.</p>\n<p>The all-new Fairlight Faran 3.0 frames arrive soon, but the pre-order page is live now at <a href=\"https://fairlightcycles.com/?v=7885444af42e\" target=\"_blank\">FairlightCycles.com</a>.
