They’ve partnered with Andy White of FYXO to create MADE Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new show will debut in conjunction with the 17th Annual Melburn Roobaix at the Darebin International Sports Centre (DISC) on June 28- 29, 2024. Like the Portland show, it’ll have dedicated hours for media to visit builders and create content before opening the doors the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/made-australia-handmade-bike-show-frame.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/made-australia-handmade-bike-show-frame-800x1000.jpg\" alt=\"poster for MADE australia handmade bicycle show\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/made-australia-handmade-bike-show-frame-800x1000.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/made-australia-handmade-bike-show-frame-240x300.jpg 240w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/made-australia-handmade-bike-show-frame-96x120.jpg 96w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/made-australia-handmade-bike-show-frame-768x960.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/made-australia-handmade-bike-show-frame.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Andy’s passion for telling the story of the custom bike world through words and images has kept us close over the years, and we are thrilled to partner with FYXO to produce MADE Australia,” states Billy Sinkford, Co-Founder of MADE and Vice President of ECHOS Communications, the PR company behind the event. “Our mission remains the same: to elevate, inspire, and highlight the global handmade community. With Andy’s deep relationships and event experience, MADE Australia will demonstrate the global reach of this vibrant community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The custom bike industry is my world. While Australia is home, I’ve proudly been a global megaphone on behalf of those creating beautiful, custom bikes and accessories, and my company FYXO hosted the first Australian Custom Bicycle Show in 2012,” said White. “The partnership with MADE gives us the needed infrastructure to provide exhibitors and attendees with an amazing experience capable of great growth. Billy and the team at ECHOS have been mates forever; there is no one better suited to bring this vision to life.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This first-year event is a smaller-scale version of their grand vision. The 2025 MADE Australia will move to Adelaide in 2025, coinciding with the Tour Down Under at the beginning of the year…and offering that hemisphere’s summer weather for the event. Meanwhile, back in the States, MADE Portland will kick off its 2nd annual event this August.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.made.bike/\" target=\"_blank\">MADE.bike</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/made-australia-bike-show-announcement/\">MADE Handmade Bike Show Heads to Australia</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"0d4b54ef3f1d41cc1d0ef8b63c7162d085e026bbfdd6b6a2f3213b825aff8b47","category":"Cycling"}
