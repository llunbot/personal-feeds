One is exploring enterprise uses for the device, while the other is looking into potential education opportunities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFinding enterprise uses for the headset could be key to its success, given the high price of the device. The Vision Pro starts at $3,500, which puts it out of the reach of some consumers.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/vision-pro-enterprise-uses/\">Apple Says Vision Pro Could Be Used for Surgeries, Technical Training and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-vision-pro-could-be-used-for-surgeries-technical-training-and-more.2416731/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3d15cfe204ab5d647cd1341ae9ed663db8dc335c2d2f6baf9862e3aaa84574e7","category":"Apple"}
