To avoid potentially giving a misdiagnosis, the feature will then direct a user to talk to their doctor or check their blood pressure with a traditional cuff, which can provide exact systolic and diastolic measurements. </blockquote>A future version of the system in development can provide exact numbers and even diagnose related conditions, according to Gurman. However, these enhancements \"remain far off,\" he adds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlso coming in 2024 is an Apple Watch-based sleep apnea detection feature. According to the report, it will use sleep and breathing patterns to estimate whether someone has the condition, and then direct users to see a physician.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/26/apple-watch-blood-glucose-up-to-seven-years-away/\">previously reported</a>, Apple is also working on non-invasive blood glucose monitoring. Apple's system is said to use a silicon photonics chip to shine light from a laser under the skin to determine the concentration of glucose in the body.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe glucose monitoring has been designed in a similar way to the blood pressure system, in that it currently monitors how a person's blood sugar is trending and warns users of pre-diabetes, rather than offer an actual blood sugar reading.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, Apple's blood glucose monitoring efforts remain unlikely to show up in a product for \"at least a few years,\" according to Gurman's latest report, citing people with knowledge of the efforts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAway from Apple Watch, Apple is also said to be on course to bring <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/12/gurman-airpods-to-gain-hearing-health-features/\">hearing aid detection</a> to AirPods in 2024. Equipped with the new feature, AirPods will be able to function as an over-the-counter hearing aid and be able to perform the hearing tests typically administered in audiologists' offices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nElsewhere, Apple is said to be continuing to explore ways to make the upcoming Apple Vision Pro headset into a health device, as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-explores-vision-pro-health-capabilities/\">reported previously</a> by <em>The Information</em>. Anti-anxiety and enhanced meditation features are being worked on, as well as a virtual-reality system to reinforce positive thinking and improve mental health.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has also been studying using the sensors in the device to scan a wearer's eyes for cognitive health data, while a headset version of Fitness+ \"remains on the table,\" according to Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <em>Bloomberg</em> report additionally includes some interesting backstory on Apple's evolving health and healthcare initiatives in recent years, as well as an update on the company's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/16/apple-primary-healthcare-service-wsj/\">paid health coaching service in development</a>.
