That's the question swirling around the Internet right now as Google announces it's investigating \"sync issues\" for Google Drive for desktop. On Monday <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/27/google_drive_files_disappearing/\">The Register</a> spotted <a href=\"https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606/google-drive-files-suddenly-disappeared-the-drive-literally-went-back-to-condition-in-may-2023?hl=en\">a trending post</a> on the Google Drive forums where a user claimed that months of Drive data suddenly disappeared, and their files went back to a state from May 2023. A few other users chimed in with the same issue, the worst of which says: \"This is going to cause me major issues if I cannot get the files back. It's all my work for the last 1-2 years. All my business work, all my personal files. Everything, just vanished. It must be 100's of files suddenly gone.\"</p>\n<p>Google has <a href=\"https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245861992\">a post up</a> on the Google Drive help forums more or less acknowledging the issue. The post, titled \"Drive for desktop (v84.0.0.0 - 84.0.4.0) Sync Issue,\" says, \"We’re investigating reports of an issue impacting a limited subset of Drive for desktop users and will follow up with more updates.\" Google adds an ominous list of things to not do in the meantime like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Do</b><b> </b><b>not click “Disconnect account” within Drive for desktop</b></li>\n<li><b>Do</b><b> </b><b>not</b><b> </b><b>delete</b><b> </b><b>or</b><b> </b><b>move</b><b> </b><b>the app data folder:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Windows: %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\DriveFS</li>\n<li>macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Google/DriveFS<b> </b></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Optional: If you have room on your hard drive, we recommend making a copy of the app data folder.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Those instructions sound like they are aimed at preserving whatever possible file cache would exist on your computer. The description of this being a \"sync\" issue doesn't really make a ton of sense, since no matter what, the Drive web interface should show all your files and let you download them. If the problem is uploading, you should still have your local files.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986763#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986763&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cafd748500c2dcc55afa2ed3a8b38a2b471879b92fa43e9de229f5b43041e0e6","category":"Tech"}
