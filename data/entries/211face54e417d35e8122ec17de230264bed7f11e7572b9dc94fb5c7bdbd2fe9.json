the riders, Grand Tours pose an equally large logistical task for the teams and their support staff.</p>\n<p>For three weeks, the work practically never stops for chefs, mechanics and soigneurs.</p>\n<p>Bikes and team vehicles need to be cleaned and maintained every evening, and riders need to be cared for to extract maximum performance.</p>\n<p>Everyone also needs to be fed multiple times per day, of course.</p>\n<p>After stage 18 of the 2023 <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/events/giro-ditalia/\">Giro d’Italia</a>, we had the opportunity to take a peek behind the curtain at the Movistar Team hotel.</p>\n<p>While the riders recovered from a long day in the mountains and prepared for the next stage, work continued for the rest of the team.</p>\n<p>We also spoke to the team’s principal directeur sportif, Max Sciandri, about how the team organises itself and the riders to extract the maximum performance possible from the unit.</p>\n<h2>Clean and check everything</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Movistar Team bucket and sponge\" title=\"20230525_SvB_EOS R__O5A9387\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Movistar Team

from the stage finish to the team hotel of about an hour and a half, there’s still plenty of work to be done.</p>\n<p>One of the main jobs for team staff post-stages is to clean and maintain both the team bikes and all of the team vehicles.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Movistar Team Canyon Aeroad CFR\" title=\"20230525_SvB_EOS R__O5A9386\"

only for looking professional, but also so the mechanics can give the bikes a once over for any problems or potential issues.</p>\n<p>Depending on the stage profile for the following day, the mechanics will also swap gearing sizes (typically by changing the rear cassette), or fit different tyres, if the parcours demands it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Given <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless tyres</a> have largely taken over in the pro peloton these days, it was also no surprise to see mechanics popping tyres off rims to check sealant levels and give wheelsets a top-up, if required.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Movistar Team mechanic fitting a Continental GP5000 S R tubeless tyre to

href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/clean-your-bike-in-7-simple-steps/\">cleans their bike</a> once a week or so, Sciandri points out “this is the pinnacle of the sport”, and the team doesn’t want to leave anything to chance.</p>\n<p>While most home mechanics make do with a standard <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-pump/\">track pump</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/6-of-the-best-tubeless-pumps-and-inflators/\">tubeless inflator</a>, the Movistar Team mechanics have an air compressor to make things as easy and efficient

notes, would have already had a recovery drink and some food on the bus back to the hotel, post-stage (typically some rice with some lean protein, such as tuna).</p>\n<p>Because it’s a Spanish team, the riders prefer to eat dinner fairly late, around 8.30pm to 8.45pm. Staff, though, Sciandri said, wouldn’t be eating until 9.30pm.</p>\n<h2>The next day</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Movistar Team bike rack layout chart\" title=\"20230525_SvB_EOS R__O5A9391\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The team mechanics have a layout of all the bikes on the roof, so they can quickly access the right one in the event a rider needs a bike change mid-race.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>For Sciandri, one of the most important evening tasks is to check plans for the following stage.</p>\n<p>Planning mid-race feeding points, for riders to take food and bottles from team staff at the side of the road, is also crucial because riders won’t always be able to go back to the team car in the race convoy to get what they need.</p>\n<p>There was also, Sciandri said, “another hour-and-a-half transfer to stage start” to consider the following morning, meaning there would be another early start to the day for the team.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Movistar Team mechanic washing a team car after stage 18 of the 2023 Giro d'Italia\" title=\"20230525_SvB_EOS R__O5A9419\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Every vehicle gets a clean to ensure the team puts its best foot forward each day.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Like a travelling circus, the team would also move everything on to the next hotel too – as would the other 21 teams in the race.</p>\n<p>Though the racing unsurprisingly dominates the headlines, the amount of work and planning that goes on behind the scenes of a Grand Tour is staggering.</p>","author":"Simon von Bromley","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"211face54e417d35e8122ec17de230264bed7f11e7572b9dc94fb5c7bdbd2fe9","category":"Cycling"}
