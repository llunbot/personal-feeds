Bike Crossteam) as they turned into the woods. Denise Betsema (Pauwels Sauzen-Bingoal) joined Brand on the climb, but soon found herself in the familiar position of chasing the world champion, with Puck Pieterse (Alpecin-Fenix) pursuing her in third. It was not an easy race for anyone, Brand, Betsema and Pieterse all hitting the deck more than once on the dangerously slick course, but the order stayed the same from the first lap to the finish.</p><p>Savouring her twenty second lead, Brand allowed herself to celebrate as she approached the finish line after a no-risk final lap, stretching her overall World Cup lead and sealing a fourth win in a row in Namur.Â </p><p>Betsema looked happy with second and Pieterse celebrated yet another elite podium finish to extend her lead in the U23 classification.</p></div></div>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"4ba245547b98d69fdfbffcbbb9ba8503dd2c522f1d8d07623b732861df25e319","category":"Cycling"}
