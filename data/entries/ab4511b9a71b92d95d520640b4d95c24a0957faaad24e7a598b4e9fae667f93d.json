The battery is not glued down and is instead held in place with iPhone-style adhesive pull tabs to make battery replacements simpler.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/macbook-pro-teardown-2.jpg\" /><em><div>14-inch MacBook Pro</div></em>\r\n<br />\r\nThe keyboard deck is part of the unibody so it won't be any easier to replace than existing keyboards, and the I/O ports are modular and should be relatively easy to replace. There is a dual fan setup inside the 14-inch model like the 16-inch model, and the fans are slightly larger than the fans in the old 13-inch MacBook Pro but are smaller than the fans in the 15-inch 2016 model.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLeaker L0vetodream also shared some teardown images of the 16-inch MacBook Pro model <a href=\"https://twitter.com/L0vetodream/status/1453114141757952000\">on Twitter</a>. He said the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Max chip is \"really large,\" with the top down view showing off the dual fans and heat pipe. A translation of the original tweet is below with more detail.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/16-inch-macbook-pro-teardown-lovetodream-1.jpg\" /><em><div>16-inch MacBook Pro</div></em><blockquote>MacBook Pro 16-inch with M1 Max first disassembled. The area of ​​the new M1 Max chip is really large (see the comparison of the size of a 1 yuan coin) RAM is divided into four particles stacked on the chip to dissipate heat is a dual fan + single heat pipe overall modularity The design of the internal design is regular and maintenance is relatively convenient. This one we have is the 1T top-equipped version (the highest configuration in the non-customized version).</blockquote>Both the 14 and 16-inch models look similar inside with the dual-fan setups and a set of six batteries, along with redesigned speaker systems.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/16-inch-macbook-pro-teardown-lovetodream-2.jpg\" /><em><div>16-inch MacBook Pro logic board</div></em>\r\n<br />\r\nWe should get a more in-depth teardown later this week from teardown site iFixit, which will give us additional information on the two machines.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">14 &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/26/macbook-pro-first-teardowns/\">Quick Teardowns Offer First Look Inside 14 and 16-Inch MacBook Pro Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/quick-teardowns-offer-first-look-inside-14-and-16-inch-macbook-pro-models.2319699/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=SpDzO_ZcyXs:aFHGS2kENws:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=SpDzO_ZcyXs:aFHGS2kENws:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/SpDzO_ZcyXs\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ab4511b9a71b92d95d520640b4d95c24a0957faaad24e7a598b4e9fae667f93d","category":"Apple"}
