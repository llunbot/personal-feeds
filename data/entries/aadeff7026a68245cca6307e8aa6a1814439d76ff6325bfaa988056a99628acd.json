The company's messaging at the time—and for months beforehand—was something along the lines of, \"We're aware, and we're working on it.\"</p>\n<p>I tend to be skeptical of these kinds of \"<a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixItInPost\">we'll fix it in post</a>\" promises; you should buy products based on what they do <em>now</em> and not what the manufacturer promises they will one day be able to do, especially for something like consumer graphics cards where there are plenty of alternatives. But credit where it's due, Intel has put quite a bit of work into improving its drivers in the year or so since the first Arc cards launched.</p>\n\n<p>Today the company has rounded up a collection of improvements made to its DirectX 11 drivers since launch, with a collection of games that run about 19 percent faster on average than they did last October. Though Arc's performance in modern DirectX 12 and Vulkan games has always been good for the price, older APIs like DirectX 9 and 11 were particular weak points of Arc's when compared to competing cards like the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3YEekkO\" target=\"_blank\">Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3KNZKBr\" target=\"_blank\">3060</a> series and the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3qHlvMj\" target=\"_blank\">AMD Radeon RX 7600</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3OEFW4M\" target=\"_blank\">6600</a> series.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961041#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961041&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aadeff7026a68245cca6307e8aa6a1814439d76ff6325bfaa988056a99628acd","category":"Tech"}
