That extra-large Coke you drank an hour ago has made its way through your kidneys into your bladder. “Time to pull over,” you think, scanning for an exit ramp.</p>\n<p>To most people, pulling into a highway rest stop is a profoundly mundane experience. But not to neuroscientist Rita Valentino, who has studied how the brain senses, interprets, and acts on the bladder’s signals. She’s fascinated by the brain’s ability to take in sensations from the bladder, combine them with signals from outside of the body, like the sights and sounds of the road, then use that information to act—in this scenario, to find a safe, socially appropriate place to pee. “To me, it’s really an example of one of the beautiful things that the brain does,” she says.</p>\n<p>Scientists used to think that our bladders were ruled by a relatively straightforward reflex—an “on-off” switch between storing urine and letting it go. “Now we realize it’s much more complex than that,” says <a href=\"https://nida.nih.gov/about-nida/organization/divisions/division-neuroscience-behavior-dnb/office-director-od\">Valentino</a>, now director of the division of neuroscience and behavior at the National Institute of Drug Abuse. An intricate network of brain regions that contribute to functions like decision-making, social interactions, and awareness of our body’s internal state, also called <a href=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/mind/2022/vital-crosstalk-between-breath-brain\">interoception</a>, participates in making the call.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028330#p3\">Read 41 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028330&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Knowable Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9fcfad2ee6e5c06bf30d7ac77a619f3db8705a304cd97e643a6783412ce52c91","category":"Tech"}
