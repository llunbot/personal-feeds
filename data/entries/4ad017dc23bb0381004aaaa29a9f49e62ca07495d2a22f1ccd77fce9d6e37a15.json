As a result, LG Display plans to adapt it for iPhone OLED panel production.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nReleased in May of this year, the 11-inch and 13-inch devices marked Apple's first use of OLED technology in larger screens and were initially projected to ship up to 10 million units in 2024. However, market research firm Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/09/m4-ipad-pro-oled-panel-sluggish-demand/\">October</a> significantly lowered that forecast to just 6.7 million units.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe move by LG Display means it can expand iPhone OLED panel production capacity without investing in an entirely new production line, which would cost around 2 trillion won ($1.5 billion). The existing OLED line, which cost 3.4 trillion won to build, can be adapted with minimal modifications.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe benefits of OLED technology include increased brightness, higher contrast ratio with deeper blacks, and improved power efficiency for longer battery life. The main technical difference between iPad and iPhone OLED panels lies in their construction: iPad displays use glass substrates with thin film encapsulation (TFE), while iPhone panels utilize a polyimide substrate with TFE and feature a single emission layer instead of two.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to the Taiwanese report, LG Display aims to maintain sufficient iPad OLED inventory through February while seeking Apple's approval for the production line modification. The company has set an ambitious target to supply 70 million iPhone OLED panels in 2024, up from mid-60 million units last year and 51.8 million units in 2023.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is said to be working on an OLED version of the iPad Air, with a potential release in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/2026-ipad-air-oled-panels-supplied-samsung/\">2026</a>. However, due to sluggish sales of OLED ‌iPad Pro‌ models, the ‌iPad Air‌'s switch from LCD to OLED could be delayed by more than a year, according to DSCC. Apple's 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are expected to switch from mini-LED to OLED as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/03/future-macbook-pro-rumors/\">early as 2026</a>.  <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-elec/\">The Elec</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro\">iPad Pro (Neutral)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/06/lg-display-to-adapt-oled-ipad-pro-line-for-iphone/\">Weak OLED iPad Pro Demand Forces Panel Supplier to Pivot to iPhone</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/weak-oled-ipad-pro-demand-forces-panel-supplier-to-pivot-to-iphone.2446777/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4ad017dc23bb0381004aaaa29a9f49e62ca07495d2a22f1ccd77fce9d6e37a15","category":"Apple"}
