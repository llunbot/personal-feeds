For years (<em>decades?</em>) XC racing had been dominated by weight weenies – not something Öhlins especially excels at. But XC has progressed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern XC racecourses got more technical, and the cross-country race bikes evolved to keep pace. Wheels got bigger in diameter (<em>29ers</em>), tires got wider (now 2.4″ is almost a new standard), geometry got slacker, frame kinematics advanced with better built-in pedaling efficiency (more anti-squat), and suspension travel simply got longer (120mm is the new norm). The result is bikes with larger unsprung mass, more travel, more supple suspension movement, and the key point here for Öhlins… more opportunity to benefit from more advanced air springs and better damping.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Developed with Team BMC Racing to target elite XC race circuit</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_BMC-racing.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_BMC-racing.jpg\" alt=\"Öhlins XC short-travel 100-120mm cross-country mountain bike racing suspension, photo by Jeff Thoren, BMC team\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_BMC-racing.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_BMC-racing-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_BMC-racing-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_BMC-racing-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_BMC-racing-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_BMC-racing-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_BMC-racing-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Better performing XC suspension now holds more potential to genuinely claw back real tangible time-savings in a modern XCO or XCM race. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Öhlins set out to create a system that can win World Cups, but also target the 2024 Olympics. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That quickly became a prestigious goal for the racing-oriented company coming from motorsports. They never had a product before that could target such a premier global human-focused event like the Olympics. To do so they needed top athletes, and rather than try to develop a team, Öhlins approached Team BMC Racing, now with former World Champ Jordan Sarrou. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_front-and-rear.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_front-and-rear.jpg\" alt=\"Öhlins XC short-travel 100-120mm cross-country mountain bike racing suspension, photo by Jeff Thoren, front &amp; rear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_front-and-rear.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_front-and-rear-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_front-and-rear-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_front-and-rear-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_front-and-rear-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_front-and-rear-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And as Öhlins tells it, BMC happily joined in without trying the new gear, trusting in the Öhlins racing heritage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the course of XC development, Öhlins settled on 34mm chassis for their new fork with 120mm of travel up front.

The TTXC1 Air is the standard volume shock with a tapered end to fit into tight spaces (available in 2 shorter strokes). The TTXC2 Air is a high-volume variant for more customizability (37.5 40, 42.5, 45mm stroke settings).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The larger volume TTXC2 Air shock can have its volume adjusted with internal spacers to dial in the perfect feel. And both TTXC1 &amp; 2 can be adjusted internally with simple clips to achieve any of their possible stroke settings. That means shops have fewer shocks to stock to fit more bikes, but also that end consumers can play around with the rear travel of the bike by tweaking shock stroke.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_rebound-and-compression-tuning_eyelets-or-trunnion.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_rebound-and-compression-tuning_eyelets-or-trunnion.jpg\" alt=\"Öhlins XC short-travel 100-120mm cross-country mountain bike racing suspension, photo by Jeff Thoren, lockouts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_rebound-and-compression-tuning_eyelets-or-trunnion.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_rebound-and-compression-tuning_eyelets-or-trunnion-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_rebound-and-compression-tuning_eyelets-or-trunnion-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_rebound-and-compression-tuning_eyelets-or-trunnion-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_rebound-and-compression-tuning_eyelets-or-trunnion-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_rebound-and-compression-tuning_eyelets-or-trunnion-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_rebound-and-compression-tuning_eyelets-or-trunnion-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ohlins-XC-short-travel-100-120mm-cross-country-mountain-bike-racing-suspension_photo-by-Jeff-Thoren_rebound-and-compression-tuning_eyelets-or-trunnion-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>remote (<em>l</em>) or manual (<em>r</em>) lockouts, with standard (<em>r</em>) or trunnion (<em>l</em>) mounts</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both were developed together as a single system, effectively combining optimized LSC &amp; HSC for remote shock versions, and separating out LSC for manual lockout shocks (in the Open mode only).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both are available with standard or trunnion mounts to fit almost any modern XC bike.
