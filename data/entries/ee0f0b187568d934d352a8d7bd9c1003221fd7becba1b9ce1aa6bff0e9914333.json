Blending the efficient ride of a road bike with off-road capability makes the do-it-all gravel bike a one-bike solution for many riders.</p>\n<p>For others, gravel bikes are cutting-edge race machines that are as highly optimised as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/worldtour-bikes/\">WorldTour road bikes</a>. Aero-optimised tech and back-achingly low positions are now commonplace at the pointy end of racing – a far cry from the humble ‘ride what ya brung’ nature of early <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/gravel-racing/\">gravel racing</a>.</p>\n<p>The rise of gravel has changed direction more than the face of wider cycling tech, however.</p>\n<p>Gravel riding has helped to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/gravel-cycling-clubs/\">develop new communities</a> and open up cycling to a more diverse mix of people than ever before.</p>\n<p>The number of gravel events has also exploded. From serious races with six-figure prize pots that attract former and current pros, to more relaxed events that celebrate the ‘party pace’ over ‘race pace’, there’s something for all tastes.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rob Weaver's long term test bike -Ra Valravn\" title=\"Rob's Ra Valravn long term\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The rumours are true – we absolutely love gravel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Few have embraced this new horizon for cycling as keenly as BikeRadar’s team of die-hard gravel nerds.</p>\n<p>From coverage of the scene’s biggest events to reviewing off-road, drop-bar bikes before the category was even born, we’ve been covering gravel since its nascent days. This week, we’ll be celebrating all things gravel.</p>\n<p>Bringing you industry-leading buyer’s guides with the latest recommendations from BikeRadar’s test team, alongside features, opinions and explainers, Gravel Week will cover the best of gravel tech and culture.</p>\n<p>Along the way, we’ll be charting the evolution of the gravel bike, exploring how gravel has influenced the latest road bike designs and delving into the burgeoning race scene.</p>\n<p>Head to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/tags/gravel-week/\">BikeRadar’s Gravel Week hub</a> for the latest gravel-tastic content or subscribe to our newsletter to get the latest tech news straight to your inbox.</p>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"ee0f0b187568d934d352a8d7bd9c1003221fd7becba1b9ce1aa6bff0e9914333","category":"Cycling"}
