Apple may require developers to purchase an ‌Apple Vision Pro‌ headset to create apps for it, but the purchase price will include access to beta software, developer labs, discussion forums, technical support, and other resources if the ‌Apple Vision Pro‌ development kit is similar to the Apple silicon development kit.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe last developer kit that Apple offered<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/22/apple-silicon-transition-program/\"> was a Mac mini with</a> an Apple silicon chip inside in 2020, and it was provided to developers to help them transition from Intel to Apple silicon. Apple sold the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a> machines for $500, but developers had to return them at the end of the testing program.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also plans to soon let developers visit ‌Apple Vision Pro‌ developer labs that will be available in Cupertino, London, Munich, Shanghai, Singapore, and Tokyo.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe latest version of TestFlight also now supports apps built with the third Xcode 15 beta for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/\">macOS Sonoma</a>, tvOS 17, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/\">watchOS 10</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/testflight/\">TestFlight</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/06/testflight-visionos-apps/\">TestFlight Now Supports visionOS Apps</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/testflight-now-supports-visionos-apps.2395224/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d43870250ea5253e1e8fae9b54766ecd981faed42bbb0b6ea756f8eb83111d18","category":"Apple"}
