Bluetti makes a range of portable power station options that are useful for camping, emergencies, power outages, off-grid living, and similar situations.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/bluetti-eb70-main.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.bluettipower.com/products/bluetti-eb70-716wh-700w-portable-power-station\">The Bluetti EB70</a> is a solid middle of the road option that offers 716Wh and support for electronics that draw up to 700W at a $599 price point.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAvailable in either red or black with a convenient carrying handle, the EB70 is equipped with a number of plug and port options. It includes four Pure Sine Wave AC outlets, two 5V/3A USB-A ports, two 100W USB-C ports, two 12V/10A DC outputs, one 12V/10A car port, and a 15W wireless charging pad right at the top.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/bluetti-eb70.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWith support for up to 700W, it's powerful enough to support appliances that draw more power like heaters and mini refrigerators while also leaving the ports open for iPhones, iPads, Macs and other devices. The USB-C ports are able to charge the 16-inch MacBook Pro at close to full speed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMAXOAK says the EB70 is designed with an ultra-stable battery that will allow it to last for 2,500 cycles before it reaches 80 percent capacity. This technology also prevents short circuiting and issues with overcurrent, overvoltage, overloading, and overheating. It has an LCD screen that displays power draw and battery level, plus it's equipped with a built-in flashlight.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/bluetti-eb70-solar-panel.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.bluettipower.com/products/bluetti-eb55-537wh-700w-portable-power-station\">Bluetti EB55</a> is more affordable at $499, and it offers the same support for appliances up to 700W, but a lower 537Wh capacity. It has four AC outlets, one 100W USB-C port, two 12V/10A DC outputs, four 5V/3A USB-A ports, and a 15W wireless charging pad, along with all of the other features of the Bluetti EB70.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/bluetti-eb55.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nFor those looking for something more compact, Bluetti has the <a href=\"https://www.bluettipower.com/products/bluetti-ac50s-500wh-300w-portable-power-station\">500Wh 300W AC50S</a>, which has a dual handle design and a colorful chassis. It features two AC ports, four USB-A ports, a 45W USB-C ports, two 12V/3A ports, a 12V/10A car port, and a 10W wireless charging pad, along with a built-in LCD.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/bluetti-blue.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nTo go along with the Bluetti power stations, MAXOAK makes solar panels. The $549 <a href=\"https://www.bluettipower.com/products/bluetti-pv200-200w-solar-panel\">Bluetti PV200 200W Solar Panel</a> is a fold down solar panel that MAXOAK says has a conversion efficiency of 23.4 percent, which lets it charge up the EB70 to full in three to four hours.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/bluetti-solar-panel.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nSmaller Bluetti power stations pair well with the more affordable <a href=\"https://www.bluettipower.com/products/bluetti-pv120-120w-solar-panel\">Bluetti PV120 120W Solar Panel</a>, which has a smaller, more portable design that's easier to carry around.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe have three Bluetti prize package for <em>MacRumors</em> readers.
