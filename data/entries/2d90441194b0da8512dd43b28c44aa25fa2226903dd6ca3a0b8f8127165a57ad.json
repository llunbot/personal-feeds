Since many of these products have been on sale for a few days, shipping may be delayed, but they're all at some of the lowest prices we've ever seen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/Last-Chance-Prime-Day-Sales-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2002\" height=\"1126\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.

You can get <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime\"><strong>one month of Amazon Prime for free</strong></a> when signing up this week, and afterwards the service will renew at $14.99 per month or $139 per year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Watch</h2>\r<br />\nPrime Day kicked off with stellar deals on both the Apple Watch SE and Apple Watch Series 8, but as the event went along the Apple Watch SE sales disappeared. Fortunately, all-time low prices remain available on both 41mm and 45mm GPS Apple Watch Series 8 models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/prime-day-series-8.jpg\" alt width=\"2002\" height=\"1126\" /><div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHF757F%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26geniuslink%3Dtrue%26th%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$119 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 8 (41mm GPS) for $279.99</div></a></div>\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHHQ7P6%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26geniuslink%3Dtrue%26th%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$119 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 8 (45mm GPS) for $309.99</div></a></div><h2>MacBook Air</h2>\r<br />\nApple's M1 MacBook Air was the first device to get a discount this Prime Day, and it remains one of the best deals around this week at $249 off. This beats the previous record low price by about $50, and it's still available in all three colors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/prime-day-macbook-air.jpg\" alt width=\"2002\" height=\"1126\" /><div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08N5M7S6K%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$249 OFF</div>M1 MacBook Air (256GB) for $749.99</div></a></div><h2>iPads</h2>\r<br />\nPerhaps the Apple product with the most abundant deals this Prime Day, we tracked numerous iPad discounts over the past few days. Many of these are still live, with all-time low prices on the 9th Gen iPad (from $249.99), iPad mini 6 (from $379.99), and iPad Air (from $499.99).\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/ipad-prime-day.jpg\" alt width=\"1384\" height=\"776\" />\r<br />\nOnly the 10th Gen iPad has seen a sale expire so far, with the 256GB Wi-Fi tablet now the only one available at an all-time low price of $529.99.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G9FPHY6\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$79 OFF</div>9th Gen iPad (64GB Wi-Fi) for $249.99</div></a></div>\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLCX2Q2\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$69 OFF</div>10th Gen iPad (256GB Wi-Fi) for $529.99</div></a></div>\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G91LXFP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26geniuslink%3Dtrue%26th%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$119 OFF</div>iPad mini (64GB Wi-Fi) for $379.99</div></a></div>\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3JH3XS%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$99 OFF</div>iPad Air (64GB Wi-Fi) for $499.99</div></a></div><h2>AirPods</h2>\r<br />\nAmazon provided solid markdowns on a few AirPods this Prime Day. The AirPods Pro 2 remain at their consistent sale price of $199.00 ($50 off) and the AirPods 2 have hit $89.99 ($39 off). These were $10 cheaper yesterday, and they may return to that price before the day ends, but for now this is a good second-best price.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/airpods-2-prime-day.jpg\" alt width=\"1384\" height=\"776\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$29 OFF</div>AirPods 2 for $89.99</div></a></div>\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHWDR12%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$50 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 for $199.00</div></a></div><h2>Anker</h2>\r<br />\nLastly, we have an Apple-related sale going on today, with Anker offering several great markdowns across its best charging accessories.
