Where uphill speed matters, the direct connection from crank to axle, without some energy-inefficient suspension spoiling the fun, is the quickest way to get up to speed.</p>\n<p>Riding rough-and-ready trails on a hardtail might beat you up a little more, but there’s something almost zen-like about being able to pick the smoothest line between the chunder, while pumping through rollers to generate free speed.</p>\n<p>Hardtails are often also lighter, easier to maintain and cheaper than full-suspension mountain bikes, because there are fewer moving parts to add weight, service or build in the first place.</p>\n<p>Here, we’ve put together our pick of the best hardtail mountain bikes as ridden, rated and reviewed by the BikeRadar team.</p>\n<h2>Hardtail vs full-suspension</h2>\n<p>Stuck between whether a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/hardtail-versus-full-suspension-mountain-bike/\">hardtail or full-suspension mountain bike</a> best suits your requirements?</p>\n<p>It all depends on the type of mountain biking you would like to take part in. Hardtails are more capable than you might initially think, but full-suspension mountain bikes come into their own on more technical terrain, especially when the gradients point downwards.</p>\n<p>Budget is the biggest factor and (with few exceptions), the entry point to a full-suspension bike is much higher than that for a hardtail. The best mountain bikes under £1,500 see full-suspension start to become available and as you start to spend more, you’ll find updates in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-frame-materials/\">frame materials</a>, as well as better components and suspension specced.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s your budget?</h2>\n<p>Buying a hardtail is one of the most affordable ways into mountain biking.</p>\n<p>As a result, it’s no surprise that hardtails dominate our buyer’s guides to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-best-mountain-bikes-under-500/\">best mountain bikes under £500</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-best-mountain-bikes-under-750/\">best mountain bikes under £750</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bikes-under-1000-2/\">best mountain bikes under £1,000</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking to buy a hardtail mountain bike, we’ve collated all of our reviews here, organised by price, as well as our reviews of hardtail frames.</p>\n<p>Use the links below to skip to the relevant section:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"#over2000\">Best hardtail over £2,000 / $2,300</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#under2000\">Best hardtail under £2,000 / $2,300</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#under1500\">Best hardtail under £1,500 / $1,700</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#under1000\">Best hardtail under £1,000 / $1,200</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#hardtailframes\">Best hardtail frames</a></li>\n</ul><p>If you’re in the market for a full-suspension bike, make sure you check out our guides to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">best trail bikes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downcountry-mountain-bikes/\">best downcountry bikes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-enduro-bikes/\">best enduro mountain bikes.</a></p>\n<p>We’ve also got a list of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cross-country-bikes/\">best cross-country bikes</a>, covering both hardtail and full-suspension designs for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cross-country-racing-guide/\">XC racing</a>.</p>\n<p>Still unsure?

It would be nice to have a slightly longer dropper to create enough space to move your weight around in the sketchiest of situations.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Signal has a great chassis that wouldn’t look out of place on a much pricier bike, and there is a good level of kit for the money without too much compromise.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/sonder-signal-st-nx-review/\">Read our full Sonder Signal ST NX review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Best hardtail mountain bikes under £1,500 / $1,700</h3>\n<h4>Kona Kahuna</h4>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Kona Kahuna hardtail mountain bike\" title=\"Kona Kahuna - 03\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Kona Kahuna has a curvy silhouette.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Superb ride quality</li>\n<li>Well-specced Shimano groupset and brakes</li>\n<li>£1,199 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>Kona’s endearing Kahuna offers a commendable ride quality in its latest guise.

This helps make it comfortable on climbs, and when paired with its 650b wheels it has a solid, stable feel and great descending composure.</p>\n<p>We weren’t without quibbles when testing this bike, though. The air-sprung front fork doesn’t offer great small-bump sensitivity, and a fork upgrade isn’t viable at this price. It would be nice to see Boost spacing too.</p>\n<p>Despite these points, you do get a lot of performance for the money and the Fury trumps its competitors in multiple ways.

When climbing, the 77.5-degree seat tube centres your weight nicely.</p>\n<p>The difference between the long and short settings is subtle, but we found the short setting preferable because it gives the bike a fun-loving personality.</p>\n<p>At the time of testing, Pipedream only offered the Moxie as a frameset with no off-the-shelf builds. This means you can customise your build however you want, but we would say be prepared to play around with stem length to get the right handling.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/pipedream-moxie-mx3-review/\">Read our full Pipedream Moxie Mx3 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h4>Cotic BFeMax</h4>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Cotic BFEMAX hardtail mountain bike\" title=\"Cotic BFEMAX\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This steel BFeMAX 29er boasts a build that screams technical capability.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Steadfast over sketchy trails</li>\n<li>The high bottom bracket has pros and cons</li>\n<li>£3,538 custom build in testing</li>\n<li>£549 (frameset) as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The steel BFe has long been a feature of the hardtail scene, with 26in, 650b and 29in wheel versions offered since 2005.</p>\n<p>The custom 29er BFeMax we rode in testing has Cotic’s aggressively shaped ‘longshot’ geometry and a spec sheet that’s built around technical capability.
