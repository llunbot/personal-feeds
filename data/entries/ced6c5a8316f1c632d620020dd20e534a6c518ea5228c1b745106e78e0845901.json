{"title":"The next stage: Fabian Cancellara profile","link":"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/fabian-cancellara-profile","date":1747931887000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/fabian-cancellara-profile\">The next stage: Fabian Cancellara profile</a></p>\n\n<p>Very few cycling champions have a career quite like Fabian Cancellara’s. It wasn’t just the soul-crushing, front-foot racing style that took him to countless time-trial victories and gave him the rare ability to simply ride off the front while being watched by the whole bunch. It wasn’t just his ability to brush off pressure like crumbs off a table. It was also about how he left the sport, and what he did next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some riders rage against the dying of the light, convinced their powers are not fading; others are content with taking on the mantle of veterans of the peloton, signing sizable contracts to dole out their experience and work for others. There’s nothing wrong with that either, but Cancellara was a rarity in that he bowed out under his own terms and at the top of the sport, with a Rio 2016 Olympic time-trial gold medal around his neck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Swiss master’s Hollywood ending was a satisfying conclusion to a career punctuated by excellence, yet at the same time it only placed added significance to the inevitable question that came with it: what next?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Life after cycling. For every individual when they retire it’s like a second life,’ Cancellara says. ‘Everything changes. There’s less… let’s call it interest. You’re less in that bubble. You find yourself looking in the mirror and asking yourself, “Who am I? What do I want? Is this right? Does that feel good? Is that me? Am I different?”’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cancellara has gone through many such uncomfortable moments of soul-searching since retiring as a racer nearly a decade ago. Understanding his own identity is a long, ongoing journey, and one that can’t be measured or quantified like numbers on a results sheet or a power meter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘As a rider I raced to win bike races, but I never reflected on who I really am. When you’re a rider you’re in sport and you don’t really know who you are as a human being in terms of not being an athlete.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-2-647x970.webp\" alt=\"Fabian Cancellara\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-2-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-2-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-2-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-2-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-2-1366x2048.webp 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-2-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-2-1140x1709.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-2.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Fabian Cancellara was one of the greats of his generation, which makes adapting to retirement even more difficult. ‘For 16 years my family did everything, while I was just coming and going. Then those roles have to change,’ he says.</figcaption><figcaption>David Powell / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘You’re 35 and you stop cycling. And you kind of restart everything else: your system, your family, who is in charge at home when it comes to kids, who raises them, who puts in what rules. Your wife says, “Some chocolate is good for them.” I say no chocolate.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Training rides are now typically an hour or two here or there, rather than five. While he has his three Roubaix cobblestone trophies in the sauna at his home in Ittigen, near Bern, he admits his kids sometimes get bored of his cycling stories. Nowadays he does the school run and tries to keep the house tidy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘For 16 years my family did everything while I was just coming and going. Then those roles have to change. You have to find your own path. You can look into your neighbour’s garden and think they have nice green grass, but you know what? No neighbour’s grass is greener. Everyone has shit in the front of his house to clean. Everyone has difficulties.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a truncated answer because Fabian Cancellara is a real talker. He starts off at the point of what he was looking for in retirement, goes off on a tangent, goes deeper into those topics and loops back round to the original question with an eloquent, seven-minute answer. He has won prologues in shorter amounts of time, with fewer twists and turns. It must be the Italian in him from his father Donato, who came to Switzerland at the age of 18. But such loquacity never leaves you in doubt of what the 44-year-old really thinks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding Cancellara</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After he left pro cycling in 2016, Cancellara had a string of partnerships and ambassadorships with brands in and out of cycling. He had, and still has, his own collection of events, Chasing Cancellara, where amateurs can race against him at venues in Switzerland. It was his version of throwing darts at a board and seeing what stuck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I didn’t want to just travel and talk and explain and always do the same,’ he says. ‘It’s a different schedule. You have to decide what you want. Are you looking for income? Or are you looking to do something you like?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 88 race wins, including seven Monuments and two Olympic golds, Cancellara is aware of his privilege. Yet even superstars can be surprisingly pigeonholed and have limited options when they step away from sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I mean, photography. Looks easy,’ he says knowingly, eliciting a smile from <em>Cyclis</em>t’s lensman as he shoots away. ‘But it would take me 20 years until I could do the same as he does. Or what the others in the office did. For them it’s nothing, but it takes 20 years to get to the level they are. I didn’t go to proper school or university or take an apprenticeship. These are issues I sometimes have to face, even if I’m not on a bad road at the moment with things.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-3-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Fabian Cancellara\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-3-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-3-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-3-768x513.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-3-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-3-1140x761.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-3-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-3-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-3-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-3.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Cancellara took over the team that is now Tudor Pro Cycling during the Covid pandemic in 2020. They are now contenders for a WorldTour place next year.</figcaption><figcaption>David Powell / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘In my racing career I was the winner or the leader, the guy that could make the difference at the end of the race. In a company it doesn’t work like that. Doing micro-management? Mmm, I don’t think so.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having toyed with various career options after his retirement, Cancellara perhaps inevitably realised that sport was his area of expertise, and he felt he wanted to give something back. In 2020 he took over Swiss Racing Academy, a small UCI Continental team (third tier), as he was unwilling to see 16 promising talents lose their jobs at the height of the pandemic. However, things kicked up several notches when watchmaker Tudor, a sister company of Rolex, came on board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An initial meeting between Cancellara and the Tudor top brass in November 2021 overran by four hours. He says they signed a contract a month later. By 2023 Tudor Pro Cycling were a UCI ProTeam in the sport’s second tier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You see the craziness of our path?’ he says, before conceding that being team owner of Tudor Pro Cycling puts him in the firing line. ‘It’s a daring approach. I’m all in, so if we lose, I lose. I lose face, then it’s done, I’m done, I’m out of cycling, I’ve failed. But then I think, what do I have to lose? More than others, perhaps, because I am Fabian Cancellara, but the way I see things now, I also have my freedom.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'like this article? get more of it every month in Cyclist magazine, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>The watchmen</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tudor watch business also partners with the likes of Inter Miami football club, Red Bull Racing, the All Blacks and David Beckham. The Swiss brand means business, and so does the cycling team. They took their first WorldTour win in 2024 with a stage at Paris-Nice for Arvid de Kleijn and repeated the feat in this year’s race through Michael Storer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Signings in 2024 included race-winners such as Storer and Matteo Trentin, who were joined in 2025 by the likes of Tour de France stage winner Marc Hirschi and former World Champion Julian Alaphilippe – the latter almost certainly the reason Tudor have been granted a wildcard entry into this year’s Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team are contenders for a WorldTour place in 2026, when the next cycle of promotion and relegation occurs between the sport’s top tiers based on UCI points scored in races. To achieve that, they need big results and to exploit the existing UCI points system, although Cancellara is no fan of racing for points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I actually like the opposite. Fuck the points,’ he says. ‘Honestly, tell your team to go out and try to win the race, because then they learn. Otherwise they learn to race to score points. I think top 20 [in the world] should be the goal because then we can do all the races.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-4-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Fabian Cancellara\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-4-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-4-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-4-768x513.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-4-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-4-1140x761.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-4-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-4-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-4-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/fabian-cancellara-2025-4.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>David Powell / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘Let’s be honest, most ProTeams are just breakaway teams trying to ride for the TV cameras. We are not like that. We have a plan. If it goes well, fine. If 20 others are faster, <em>c’est la vie</em>.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a team owner, there is a degree of uncertainty about what his exact responsibilities should be. It’s a fuzzy role: he is not the sports director, a tactically hands on position, or the CEO, who is responsible for daily operations. Cancellara describes himself as the ‘daddy’ of the team, not there to loom large over them like a Patrick Lefevere or Bjarne Riis-type figure. As the structure grows, he finds himself going to fewer bike races and spending more time in the office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if there’s one thing he understands and looks to pass on, it’s a champion’s ambition and how to achieve targets.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/marc-madiot-profile\">Pride and passion: Marc Madiot profile</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/adios-ineos-luke-rowe-profile\">Adios Ineos: Luke Rowe profile</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tom-pidcock-profile\">‘I was made out to be the bad guy’: Tom Pidcock profile</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/victor-campenaerts-profile\">‘You need to have that killer mentality’: Victor Campenaerts profile</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>‘I trained to win bike races,’ he says. ‘It sounds crazy, but I liked suffering. And it’s tough to do, but what is your dream? Sport is tough. You should always dream and put the bar higher so that you work a bit harder.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what does he think of cycling’s new stars, such as Tadej Pogačar and Jonas Vingegaard?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘If you look at Tom Boonen and myself, it’s the same as today. It’s just a different decade. I also did 50km breakaways alone. Today it’s 80km, so things have changed, but they’re not better, just different. Why are races so fast? Because of the equipment, training, digital support and sleeping – all the science that came into cycling.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"638\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/02182726/fabian_cancellara_ofs_paris-roubaix_2010_31-970x638.jpg\" alt=\"fabian_cancellara_ofs_paris-roubaix_2010_31\" /><figcaption>Fabian Cancellara on his way to victory at Paris-Roubaix in 2010, one of seven Monument wins he took during his career.</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Cancellara is far from bored that his life continues to revolve around cycling. He is often busier than he was as a professional cyclist – in many ways it’s like he’s taking on a different, more long-term form of time-trial now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I still need to work on having more time. Not for the team, or for my wife or the kids, just my own time,’ he says. ‘Like I explained before, I did cycling for 20 years and the family did everything else. In normal life, you grow, see your friends once a week or once a month. But I never had that. Or you do a boys’ trip twice a year. I missed that. It’s not part of my life experience.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a father and a successful businessman and former professional sportsman, Cancellara is a bit too suave to go on a lads’ holiday to Magaluf. But he is sometimes struck by the urge to break out and do some typical ‘guy stuff’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Sometimes I think, “Should I go for a motorbike licence, truck licence or a boat licence?” Just small things like that, and it makes me ask: damn, am I really such a simple guy?’ he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when he looks in the mirror today, who and what does Cancellara see?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I’m happy,’ he says, ‘because I have found the balance. Not perspective, not an anchor, but something where I can give something to create something. I can give a piece of myself to a project where I can have success.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cancellara on…</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>His favourite luxury</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Just flying. When I go on long flights I like to have my space. First class. Having freedom, having good food and service. Good service is a luxury too.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>His pet peeve</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I hate standing in queues. In the supermarket, in a bar, wherever it is. I will take any opportunity to avoid this and be somewhere else.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tudor Pro Cycling’s identity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Feet on the ground. We don’t spoil around posturing and bragging, thinking we are the big ones. Hidden class.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Not the next Fabian Cancellara</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>‘My kids don’t ride. A name is not always helpful. Having Cancellara as your surname can be good and bad, like Axel always in the shadow of Eddy Merckx. My younger one rode a little, but she is not into it at the moment. She has power. She could drop everyone. They would say she’s the next one…’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclist newsletter banner saying 'stay one step ahead of the pack, click here to sign up'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/fabian-cancellara-profile\">The next stage: Fabian Cancellara profile</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"ced6c5a8316f1c632d620020dd20e534a6c518ea5228c1b745106e78e0845901","category":"Cycling"}
