Well, the inventor of that cool piece of bike gear is at it again. This time he’s got a Kickstarter (coming April 8th) for a new bike bag. It’s called the <a href=\"http://www.rekkiworks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DX35, and it’s a 35-liter bikepacking bag</a> with functional storage–that’s accessible while riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bag is waterproof and works best on any flat, alt, or drop bar bike with a front rack, but the DX35 also features a removable GEARLID that makes the contents accessible while on the go</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Rekki Works DX35 </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rekki-Works-DX35-Bikepacking-Bag-first-pic-e1742319799915.webp\"><img width=\"750\" height=\"539\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rekki-Works-DX35-Bikepacking-Bag-first-pic-e1742319799915.webp\" alt=\"Rekki Works DX35 Bikepacking Bag first pic\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rekki-Works-DX35-Bikepacking-Bag-first-pic-e1742319799915.webp 750w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rekki-Works-DX35-Bikepacking-Bag-first-pic-e1742319799915-297x213.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rekki-Works-DX35-Bikepacking-Bag-first-pic-e1742319799915-120x86.webp 120w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Rekki Works)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two main storage spots, with 6 liters in the GEARLID, and 25 liters in the main “bucket”, plus 4 liters of side pocket storage, at 2 liters per side.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rekki-Works-DX35-Bikepacking-Bag-adventure.webp\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rekki-Works-DX35-Bikepacking-Bag-adventure.webp\" alt=\"Rekki Works DX35 Bikepacking Bag adventure\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rekki-Works-DX35-Bikepacking-Bag-adventure.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rekki-Works-DX35-Bikepacking-Bag-adventure-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rekki-Works-DX35-Bikepacking-Bag-adventure-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rekki-Works-DX35-Bikepacking-Bag-adventure-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The removable GEARLID has three zippered pockets, and the main bucket is easily opened with one hand with the drawstring open/close system.
