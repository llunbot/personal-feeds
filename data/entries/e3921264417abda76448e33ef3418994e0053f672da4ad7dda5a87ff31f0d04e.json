Here are the full support lists:</p>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-10-at-3.05.43%E2%80%AFPM-980x575.jpeg\" /></div>\n          <p>\n            The iOS 18 support list.

But the seventh-gen iPad has 3GB of RAM instead of 2GB. This is the same amount as the third-gen iPad Air and fifth-gen iPad mini—apparently that extra gigabyte is crucial for running iPadOS 18's new features.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030142#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030142&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e3921264417abda76448e33ef3418994e0053f672da4ad7dda5a87ff31f0d04e","category":"Tech"}
