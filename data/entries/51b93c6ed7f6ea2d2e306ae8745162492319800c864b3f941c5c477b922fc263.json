However, it’s easy to run into a problem: the interface elements on the external display can wind up so small that you have a hard time making them out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have a few ways to improve this situation, though readers have found that not all work in their circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Set the display size to Default or Larger Text</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In  &gt; <em>System Settings</em> &gt; <em>Displays</em> with your large display selected, the default settings shown have a “Use as” section with at least four choices. Larger Text and Default cause macOS to act as if the display is lower resolution relative to the typeface and interface element used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, what’s rendered on the screen, like typefaces, images, and video, continues to use the device’s native resolution. This is often the easiest and best solution—if it works for your display.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-display-larger-text-sizes-bordered.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-display-larger-text-sizes-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 976w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-display-larger-text-sizes-bordered.png?resize=300%2C234&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-display-larger-text-sizes-bordered.png?resize=768%2C599&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"976\" height=\"761\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Set  your display to show larger text sizes using standard options in Displays.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can choose among a greater range of sizes and demonstrate the effect of higher-resolution rendering to yourself by clicking the <em>Advanced</em> button in <em>Displays</em> and then enabling “Show resolutions as list.” This reveals all resolutions for which the native display density is retained even as the size of interface elements changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you enable “Show all resolutions,” you will see some resolutions show with “(low resolution)” after them. If you select one of those and compare it to the same option without the label, you can see how the rendering differs—the “jaggies” are quite obvious at low resolution.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-display-all-resolutions-bordered.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-display-all-resolutions-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 957w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-display-all-resolutions-bordered.png?resize=300%2C202&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-display-all-resolutions-bordered.png?resize=768%2C518&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-display-all-resolutions-bordered.png?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"957\" height=\"645\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>You can see all resolutions, including ones that render at a lower resolution than the display’s true capability.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Work with Accessibility settings</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In <em>System Settings</em> &gt; <em>Accessibility</em> &gt; <em>Display</em> under the <em>Text</em> and <em>Pointer</em> sections, you can adjust the size of type systemwide, increase the menu bar’s size, and make the pointer easy to see or spot (when jiggled). Not all apps support the “Text size” setting, but it’s likely you’re using only a few—or just the TV and Safari apps—with your external display.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-accessibility-text-sizes-bordered.png?w=1200\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-accessibility-text-sizes-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1436w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-accessibility-text-sizes-bordered.png?resize=300%2C198&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-accessibility-text-sizes-bordered.png?resize=768%2C508&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-accessibility-text-sizes-bordered.png?resize=1200%2C794&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-accessibility-text-sizes-bordered.png?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"794\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Accessibility options may help with legible text and pointer sizes on a large external display.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Turn to a third-party app, BetterDisplay Pro</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many readers suggest <a href=\"https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay\">BetterDisplay Pro</a> as a more complete set of options for scaling the Mac’s user interface elements relative to the size of the display without causing other issues. This utility lets you unlock high-definition rendering (HiDPI) when the display doesn’t meet Apple’s more restrictive set of resolutions for which it lets you set bigger user interface elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The developer’s wiki <a href=\"https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay/wiki/Fully-scalable-HiDPI-desktop\">has a detailed page</a> on how to customize this feature. However, it mostly involves installing the app, turning on “Edit the system configuration of this display model” and “Enable flexible scaling” and then clicking <em>Apply</em> for the display you want to control.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-better-display-hidpi-bordered.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-better-display-hidpi-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1122w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-better-display-hidpi-bordered.png?resize=300%2C286&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-better-display-hidpi-bordered.png?resize=768%2C732&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"977\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Using BetterDisplay Pro, you can tune the way in which user interface and display resolution interact.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>BetterDisplay has a free and a Pro version; the Pro version is required to unlock the HiDPI feature. However, the developer offers a 14-day free trial, which allows you to test whether the option solves your problem. To keep using it, the cost is $19.99 or €19.99, depending on your region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Andy.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
