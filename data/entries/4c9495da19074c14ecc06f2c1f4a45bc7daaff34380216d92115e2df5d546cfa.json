This lightweight carbon Bosch SX-powered ebike is built to be a fully-capable everyday commuter that will do double duties on the weekend. Taking your gravel riding explorations further.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Grizl:ON carbon gravel ebike </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_riding-blur.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1012\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_riding-blur.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Grizl:ON carbon gravel ebike, photo by Pol Foguet, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_riding-blur.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_riding-blur-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_riding-blur-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_riding-blur-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_riding-blur-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_riding-blur-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_riding-blur-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos by Pol Foguet/Canyon)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon says their new Grizl:ON is an everyday workhorse ebike with ‘boundary-pushing’ adventure aspirations. Functionally based on the standard <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/canyon-grizl-gravel-bike-rides-bikepacking-adventures-on-all-new-grail-trail-inspiration/\" target=\"_blank\">pedal-powered Grizl</a> adventure &amp; bikepacking gravel bike, Canyon adds ON a Bosch SX motor for this ebike iteration. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a light carbon frame and a midsized internal battery, the Grizl:ON remains lightweight for everyday riding. But you can still snap in an external range extender battery for an added boost on longer rides. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_angled.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_angled.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Grizl:ON carbon gravel ebike, photo by Pol Foguet, angled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_angled.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_angled-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_angled-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_angled-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_angled-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_angled-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_angled-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And while suspension forks are optional on the standard Grizl for extra comfort, all of the Grizl:ON ebikes come set up with 40mm of front suspension. And either the bump-eating split-leaf VCLS seatpost or a squishy Reverb. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_fender-rack-Ortlieb-pannier-bag.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_fender-rack-Ortlieb-pannier-bag.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Grizl:ON carbon gravel ebike, photo by Pol Foguet, integrated rear rack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_fender-rack-Ortlieb-pannier-bag.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_fender-rack-Ortlieb-pannier-bag-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_fender-rack-Ortlieb-pannier-bag-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_fender-rack-Ortlieb-pannier-bag-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_fender-rack-Ortlieb-pannier-bag-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_fender-rack-Ortlieb-pannier-bag-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_fender-rack-Ortlieb-pannier-bag-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new ebike also integrates lighting into the seatstays, a quick release bag into the main frame, and a practical optional set of full fenders &amp; Ortlieb-integrated rear rack. Of note, this is the first full-coverage fender made to fit the RockShox Rudy fork.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_Bosch-SX-motor-and-range-extender-battery.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_Bosch-SX-motor-and-range-extender-battery.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Grizl:ON carbon gravel ebike, photo by Pol Foguet, Bosch SX motor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_Bosch-SX-motor-and-range-extender-battery.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_Bosch-SX-motor-and-range-extender-battery-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_Bosch-SX-motor-and-range-extender-battery-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_Bosch-SX-motor-and-range-extender-battery-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_Bosch-SX-motor-and-range-extender-battery-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_Bosch-SX-motor-and-range-extender-battery-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_Bosch-SX-motor-and-range-extender-battery-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Canyon Grizl:ON features a carbon frame with a 400Wh internal main battery to power the 2kg mid-drive Bosch Performance Line SX motor’s 55Nm torque output. Then, an extra 250Wh battery can be snapped into place on the downtube bottle bosses to extend the pedal-assist range. And 700c x 50mm tire clearance opens up plenty of terrain for this dropbar ebike to explore. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_QR-frame-bag.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_QR-frame-bag.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Grizl:ON carbon gravel ebike, photo by Pol Foguet, frame bag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_QR-frame-bag.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_QR-frame-bag-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_QR-frame-bag-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_QR-frame-bag-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_QR-frame-bag-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_QR-frame-bag-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_QR-frame-bag-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we saw on the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2023-canyon-grail-carbon-gravel-race-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">recent Grail redesign</a>, the new Canyon Grizl:ON features a neatly integrated QuickLoader partial frame bag. It snaps quickly into place with magnetic Fidlock studs – no fiddly straps. The Canyon-made bag sits flush &amp; aero against the frame, shaped to allow two full-sized bottles on all frame sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_integrated-lights.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_integrated-lights.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Grizl:ON carbon gravel ebike, photo by Pol Foguet, lighting\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_integrated-lights.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_integrated-lights-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_integrated-lights-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_integrated-lights-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_integrated-lights-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_photo-by-Pol-Foguet_integrated-lights-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Integrated into the seatstay ends above the axle, Canyon worked with Lupine to build in SightStays taillights for extra visibility. Then up front, a Lupine Nano SL headlight mounted under the stem faceplate lights your way. That means wired-in front &amp; rear lighting that you don’t have to keep charged separately of the main ebike battery. Those efficient LED lights run for 2hrs after you drain the ebike’s pedal-assist battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Gravel eBike geometry</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_geometry.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_geometry.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Grizl:ON carbon gravel ebike, geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_geometry.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_geometry-297x134.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_geometry-800x360.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_geometry-120x54.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_geometry-768x346.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_geometry-1536x691.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon defines the Grizl:ON as “confidently capable” with a slacker than the Grail or <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/canyon-grizl-gravel-bike-rides-bikepacking-adventures-on-all-new-grail-trail-inspiration/\" target=\"_blank\">Grizl</a> 69.5° headtube paired to a steep 74° seat angle. In fact, with the longer 439mm chainstays that come with the motor and ample tire clearance, Canyon admits that geometry for the new gravel ebike was designed by the same MTB designers that crafted the latest <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/canyon-striveon-cfr-carbon-enduro-race-ebike/\">Strive:ON</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/upgraded-canyon-spectralon-brings-smart-canyon-app-gps-tracking-security/\" target=\"_blank\">Spectral:ON</a>. So unsurprisingly, there’s relatively long frame Reach with a short 60mm stem. But more upright Stack than the standard Canyon gravel bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Canyon Grizl:ON still comes in five frame sizes (XS-XL) to fit a wide range of riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2024 Canyon Grizl:ON – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_city-to-trail.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1013\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_city-to-trail.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Grizl:ON carbon gravel ebike, photo by Pol Foguet, loaded\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_city-to-trail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_city-to-trail-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_city-to-trail-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_city-to-trail-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_city-to-trail-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_city-to-trail-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Canyon-Grizl-ON-carbon-gravel-ebike_city-to-trail-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are four complete builds available of the new 2024 Canyon Grizl:ON gravel ebike.
