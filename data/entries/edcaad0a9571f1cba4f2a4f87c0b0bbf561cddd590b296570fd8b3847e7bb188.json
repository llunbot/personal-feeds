The basis appears to be the same carbon-crown RXC34 fork and TXC2 Air shock, but now mechanical lockouts are replaced with electronic controls. In the pits, Titouan Carod’s BMC mechanics mostly kept everything neatly wrapped up. But out on the track we got a closer look at what looks like the smart controller added onto the rear shock…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Öhlins prototype electronic XC MTB suspension </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_Titouan-Carod-warm-up.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_Titouan-Carod-warm-up.jpg\" alt=\"Öhlins prototype electronic XC mountain bike suspension raced at Nove Mesto MTB World Cup, Titouan Carod warming up on BMC Fourstroke\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_Titouan-Carod-warm-up.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_Titouan-Carod-warm-up-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_Titouan-Carod-warm-up-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_Titouan-Carod-warm-up-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_Titouan-Carod-warm-up-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_Titouan-Carod-warm-up-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_Titouan-Carod-warm-up-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(All photos/Cory Benson) </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Spotting Carod warming up for the Nové Město na Moravě short track over the weekend, we noticed and extra box sticking out of the front of his Öhlins TXC Air rear shock, tucked in between the front shock mount on his BMC Fourstroke XC race bike.

We’ve seen a few variants of Loic Bruni racing electronic Öhlins DH prototypes, both on a reconfigured <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/spotted-prototype-ohlins-electronic-suspension-on-loic-brunis-winning-custom-specialized-demo/\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized Demo</a> and an <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/spotted-loic-brunis-prototype-specialized-dh-bike-at-british-nationals/\" target=\"_blank\">all-new prototype bike</a> that’s still in development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But while all that prototype DH tech was well-covered under big cowls, this BMC is fitted with much smaller tech that more easily tucked into the otherwise stock frame. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, it’s being left uncovered, at least for racing…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Prototype electronic TXC Air shock wrapped up tight in the pits, mostly</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_wrapped-up-tight.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_wrapped-up-tight.jpg\" alt=\"Öhlins prototype electronic XC mountain bike suspension raced at Nove Mesto MTB World Cup, all wrapped up TXC2Air shock\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_wrapped-up-tight.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_wrapped-up-tight-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_wrapped-up-tight-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_wrapped-up-tight-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_wrapped-up-tight-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_wrapped-up-tight-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_wrapped-up-tight-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part, the Team BMC Racing mechanics tried to keep the new Öhlins electronic prototypes on Carod’s bike wrapped up inside a velcro-on neoprene sleeve. At least when they weren’t working on the bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the weekend’s cross-country racing started off quite wet &amp; muddy, so there were plenty of times when they pulled back the covers to service the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, why might they keep the prototypes uncovered out on the track and for racing, yet wrap it up in the pits?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_uncovered-in-the-work-stand.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_uncovered-in-the-work-stand.jpg\" alt=\"Öhlins prototype electronic XC mountain bike suspension raced at Nove Mesto MTB World Cup, uncovered in the pits\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_uncovered-in-the-work-stand.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_uncovered-in-the-work-stand-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_uncovered-in-the-work-stand-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_uncovered-in-the-work-stand-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_uncovered-in-the-work-stand-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_uncovered-in-the-work-stand-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_uncovered-in-the-work-stand-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My guesses would be 1 or 3 possibilities. Either the electronics need airflow to get the best function, or the cover might simply impede some movement? The rider or mechanics may need easy access on the track to make adjustments, otherwise inaccessible under the neoprene cover? Or perhaps, they just need to see how it stands up to the elements in a real-world racing scenario.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, the result is that we got a pretty good sneak peek by keeping our eyes open.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Electronic prototype Öhlins RXC34 Carbon Air fork</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_RXC-34-fork-lowers-customized.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_RXC-34-fork-lowers-customized.jpg\" alt=\"Öhlins prototype electronic XC mountain bike suspension raced at Nove Mesto MTB World Cup, a RXC34 mk.1 fork with custom internals\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_RXC-34-fork-lowers-customized.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_RXC-34-fork-lowers-customized-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_RXC-34-fork-lowers-customized-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_RXC-34-fork-lowers-customized-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_RXC-34-fork-lowers-customized-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, so we know there’s some electronic control. But what suspension are we working with?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It appears that only Titouan Carod is racing on the prototype electronic suspension. The rest of the BMC team gets mechanical remotes. And it looks like he’s working with the Öhlins <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ohlins-xc-race-ready-suspension-3-rxc34-forks-2-txcair-shocks-hit-the-world-cup/\" target=\"_blank\">RXC34 fork</a> that we detailed last summer, based on these lowers. Of course, we probably wouldn’t call it an m.1 fork anymore, as clearly he’s got some custom next-gen tech inside. And his name on the fork legs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_wired-fork-top-cap.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_wired-fork-top-cap.jpg\" alt=\"Öhlins prototype electronic XC mountain bike suspension raced at Nove Mesto MTB World Cup, everything hidden inside the RXC34 fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_wired-fork-top-cap.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_wired-fork-top-cap-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_wired-fork-top-cap-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_wired-fork-top-cap-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_wired-fork-top-cap-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_wired-fork-top-cap-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_wired-fork-top-cap-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What electronic controls that exist are entirely in the left leg. That’s where the 3-position (Open, Pedal, Lock) OTX14 compression damper cartridge is on the standard Öhlins RXC34 fork. (The volume-adjustable air spring is in the right leg.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t see an obvious external adjustment here. But that small gold screw is the same as found on the front of the shock control/battery box. So it might offer some adjustability more than just holding the cap on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A single wire (&amp; inline connector) exits, and heads into the frame next to the mechanical dropper remote cable. Presumably, the fork then connects with the system brain, at the rear shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tidy Electronic Remote Control</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_Carod-handlebar-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_Carod-handlebar-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Öhlins prototype electronic XC mountain bike suspension raced at Nove Mesto MTB World Cup, tiny twist switch remote control\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_Carod-handlebar-detail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_Carod-handlebar-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_Carod-handlebar-detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_Carod-handlebar-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_Carod-handlebar-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_Carod-handlebar-detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_Carod-handlebar-detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For rider mode control of the prototype electronic suspension, Öhlins gives Carod a tidy little thumb-actuated twist shifter/switch.

But perhaps Öhlins just worked together with Zirbel to create the  remote they needed for their prototype suspension controls.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Uncovered and Up Close!</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_warming-up.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_warming-up.jpg\" alt=\"Öhlins prototype electronic XC mountain bike suspension raced at Nove Mesto MTB World Cup, unwrapped\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_warming-up.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_warming-up-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_warming-up-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_warming-up-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_warming-up-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_warming-up-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_warming-up-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now for the proper spy shots!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Team BMC mechanics were as careful as they could be to keep their Öhlins prototype electronic XC suspension out of direct sight in the pits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But once racing was underway, the mechanics unwrapped the shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, what they kept covered doesn’t really reveal too much after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_detail-in-the-work-stand.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_detail-in-the-work-stand.jpg\" alt=\"Öhlins prototype electronic XC mountain bike suspension raced at Nove Mesto MTB World Cup, uncovered in the pits, and up close\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_detail-in-the-work-stand.jpg 850w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_detail-in-the-work-stand-297x157.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_detail-in-the-work-stand-120x64.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_detail-in-the-work-stand-768x407.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All we can really see is a narrow box extending forward from the damping controls of the TXC Air shock. In fact, a closer look at the photo we snuck from the workstand (<em>above</em>) suggests the shock itself is wholly unchanged. There’s just a small electronic actuator bolted on top, instead of the mechanical remote actuator, which of course makes sense for simplicity’s sake.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_warm-up-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_warm-up-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Öhlins prototype electronic XC mountain bike suspension raced at Nove Mesto MTB World Cup, unwrapped and up close\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_warm-up-detail.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_warm-up-detail-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_warm-up-detail-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_warm-up-detail-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ohlins-Electronic-XC-Suspension-Prototype-raced-at-Nove-Mesto-MTB-World-Cup_warm-up-detail-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then what you get is that this box is just the battery and brain of the system. We see the two wires coming in from the fork &amp; remote switch to connect to the box just in front of the upper shock eyelet. And the wire for the rear shock power &amp; control exits out of the middle of the box on the left/non-driveside.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div><blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7PQYFwNZ2q/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7PQYFwNZ2q/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by TITOUAN CAROD (@titoucarod)</a></p></div></blockquote></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, so now we wait. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neither Öhlins nor BMC have officially commented on what we see here. And it’s only being race-tested on one rider’s bike. So don’t expect it too soon. With that said though, it was less than half a year between when we first saw Öhlins XC suspension prototypes until the time you could actually buy them. So maybe we won’t have so long to wait!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.ohlins.com/products/mountainbike/\" target=\"_blank\">Ohlins.com/MountainBike</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ohlins-prototype-electronic-xc-mtb-suspension/\">Öhlins Prototype Electronic XC Suspension Raced on the MTB World Cup: Uncovered!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"edcaad0a9571f1cba4f2a4f87c0b0bbf561cddd590b296570fd8b3847e7bb188","category":"Cycling"}
