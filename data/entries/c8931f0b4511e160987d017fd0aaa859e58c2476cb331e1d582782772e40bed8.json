These terms warn that chat content is \"recorded and stored temporarily\" both on your system and the system of those you chat with. But those stored recordings are only shared with Nintendo if a user reports a violation of <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/community-guidelines/?srsltid=AfmBOoq-mAHbzdcIN7q8kBPONxq-dm5WM2_fFDG_ec16SRZc0dWkz-Xr\">Nintendo's Community Guidelines</a>, the company writes.</p>\n<p>That reporting feature lets a user \"review a recording of the last three minutes of the latest three GameChat sessions\" to highlight a particular section for review, suggesting that chat sessions are not being captured and stored in full. The terms also lay out that \"these recordings are available only if the report is submitted within 24 hours,\" suggesting that recordings are deleted from local storage after a full day.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/nintendo-warns-switch-2-gamechat-users-your-chat-is-recorded/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/nintendo-warns-switch-2-gamechat-users-your-chat-is-recorded/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c8931f0b4511e160987d017fd0aaa859e58c2476cb331e1d582782772e40bed8","category":"Tech"}
