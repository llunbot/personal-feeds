But judging by my various feeds, fans are already swooning over the prospect of director Denis Villeneuve extending his vision into a trilogy by adapting Frank Herbert's 1969 sequel, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_Messiah\"><em>Dune Messiah</em></a>, for the next installment. Will there be a <em>Dune: Part Three</em>? Most signs currently point to yes, with a couple of caveats. Exactly how soon we'll be seeing a return to Arrakis depends a lot on Villeneuve.</p>\n<p>Variety <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/news/dune-3-denis-villeneuve-legendary-nuclear-war-1235960990/\">confirmed</a> that Legendary Pictures is working with the director on developing <em>Dune: Part Three</em>, although it remains unclear from the wording of the plethora of news items whether the project has officially been greenlit. (\"Development\" can mean a lot of things.) Naturally, the studio is eager, as are we: the film is the biggest hit of 2024 thus far, with global earnings of $630 million (although the hotly anticipated <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/02/wade-wilson-joins-the-mcu-in-deadpool-and-wolverine-super-bowl-teaser/\"><em>Deadpool and Wolverine</em></a> this summer might give it a run for its money).</p>\n<p>That confirmation sent fresh <em>frissons</em> of excitement across the Internet, although Villeneuve had been talking about the prospect as far back as <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/dune-director-denis-villeneuve-teases-165120139.html\">September 2021</a>. Those plans always depended on the success of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/12/love-blooms-in-the-midst-of-war-in-latest-trailer-for-dune-part-two/\"><em>Part Two</em></a>, and that hurdle has obviously been cleared. By August 2023, the director was <a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/denis-villeneuve-teases-dune-part-three-dune-messiah-exclusive/\">on record saying</a> there were \"words on paper\" for a third film. And we learned just <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/artisans/news/dune-2-hans-zimmer-paul-chani-love-theme-gurneys-song-1235924690/\">last month</a> that composer Hans Zimmer was already working on the score for <em>Dune: Part Three</em>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015206#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015206&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2520ba4d949d7ff06962b8a55769ab29eb0711a8d7c08524fbc88062038e4a0f","category":"Tech"}
