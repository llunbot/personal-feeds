That's when mathematicians John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz successfully ran the first program written in their newly developed BASIC (Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) programming language on the college's General Electric GE-225 mainframe.</p>\n<p>Little did they know that their creation would go on to democratize computing and inspire generations of programmers over the next six decades.</p>\n<h2>What is BASIC?</h2>\n<p>In its most traditional form, BASIC is an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)\">interpreted</a> programming language that runs line by line, with line numbers. A typical program might look something like this:</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020962#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020962&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fd0543f1a4a9cada67b9e5f4a9e27b85e3b07630ed6112be38bf261f99f52059","category":"Tech"}
