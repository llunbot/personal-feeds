Lee, is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/samsung-leader-jay-y-lee-released-prison-parole-2021-08-13/\">out of jail</a> on parole today. Lee <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/samsungs-top-executive-gets-30-months-in-prison-for-bribery/\">was serving</a> a 30-month sentence for his role in \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_South_Korean_political_scandal\">Choi-gate</a>,\" a major 2016 South Korean political scandal that brought down South Korean then-President Park Geun-hye.</p>\n<p>In 2017, Lee was originally sentenced to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/samsung-heir-convicted-sentenced-to-5-years-on-corruption-charges/\">five years</a> in jail after being found guilty of bribery, embezzlement, capital flight, and perjury. An appeal and retrial cut Lee's five-year prison sentence down to 30 months after suspending the charges for bribery and embezzlement. Lee served 18 months of that sentence, and now he's out on parole.</p>\n<p>Choi-gate is an incredible rabbit hole you can dive into at the above Wikipedia link, but in short, it's named for Choi Soon-Sil, a shamanistic cult member and a woman often called \"Korean Rasputin,\" due to her influence over South Korea's then-president. Lee was accused of bribing Choi to get a favorable ruling from Park related to a 2015 merger of two Samsung affiliates, Samsung C&amp;T Corp (that's \"Construction &amp; Trading\") and Cheil Industries, a Korean textile firm.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787038#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787038&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b73acba4a65f4ce254b5f039b9b357a1653f32fb698ef30db837a287aff4aa0d","category":"Tech"}
