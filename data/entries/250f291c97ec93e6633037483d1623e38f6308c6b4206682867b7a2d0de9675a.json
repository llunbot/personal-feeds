This is now the 14th investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and one of several <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/nhtsa-wants-autopilot-answers-from-tesla-after-20-post-recall-crashes/\">currently open</a>. This time, it's the automaker's highly controversial \"full self-driving\" feature that's in the crosshairs—NHTSA says it now has four reports of Teslas using FSD and then crashing after the camera-only system encountered fog, sun glare, or airborne dust.</p>\n<p>Of the four crashes that sparked <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2024/INOA-PE24031-23232.pdf\">this investigation</a>, one caused the death of a pedestrian when a Model Y crashed into them in Rimrock, Arizona, in November 2023.</p>\n<p>NHTSA has a standing general order <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting\">that requires</a> it to be told if a car crashes while operating under partial or full automation. Fully automated or autonomous means cars might be termed \"actually self-driving,\" such as the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/feds-probe-waymo-driverless-cars-hitting-parked-cars-drifting-into-traffic/\">Waymos</a> and Zooxes that clutter up the streets of San Francisco. Festooned with dozens of exterior sensors, these four-wheel testbeds drive around—mostly empty of passengers—gathering data to train themselves with later, with no human supervision. (This is also known as SAE level 4 automation.)</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/feds-open-their-14th-tesla-safety-investigation-this-time-for-fsd/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/feds-open-their-14th-tesla-safety-investigation-this-time-for-fsd/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
