And while we’ve by no means ticked off everything on our ride location bucket list, we’ve definitely done a lot of them (see for yourself over at our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/rides\" target=\"_blank\">Rides</a> subscriber site).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the idea of looking at famous cycling destinations merely as trophies to be collected or numbers to be crossed off on the world’s most expensive bingo card misses a bigger point – that once you’ve joined the inevitable hordes on the obligatory Must-Do Climb, you’ll often find a better riding experience to be had just round the corner – a more authentic and genuine experience, and – crucially – one that not everyone knows about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve experienced near-solitude on gravel ascents of Alpe d’Huez and the Galibier, for example – two of the busiest ‘bucket list climbs’ on the planet – and had the natural splendours of the Gorge de la Méouge all to ourselves when just down the road the masses were battling traffic (and each other) for space on the road up Mont Ventoux.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-2-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclist Magazine issue 161\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>And that willingness to look beyond the obvious has reaped rich rewards again in our April 2025 issue, which is available now on newsstands and <a href=\"https://shop.cyclist.co.uk/collections/coffee/products/issue-161\" target=\"_blank\">at the Cyclist Shop</a>. Our Big Ride takes us to a place many readers will know well – Mallorca – but rather than heading for big-ticket locations such as Sa Calobra or the Cap de Formentor, we’re delving deeper in search of hidden gems. And rest assured, over a 115km ride that features as many secluded beaches as punishing climbs, Mallorca more than delivers.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-3-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclist Magazine issue 161\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-3-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The theme of finding fresh appeal in the familiar applies just as readily to our visit to Colnago’s headquarters in Italy, also in the April issue. With a huge bike collection on site that tells the story of some of the sport’s greatest champions down the years, Colnago is very much cycling royalty and has been at the cutting edge of bike design for decades. Yet as we witness first hand the production of its latest flagship frame, the C68, we discover a brand that is as firmly committed to innovation as it is faithful to its heritage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of heritage, few cycling races on the calendar embody the term as purely as the Tour of Flanders, and in the second instalment in our series on cycling’s historical artifacts, our April issue takes us to the Centrum Ronde van Vlaanderen, the race’s spiritual home. We pick out some of the museum’s greatest treasures, and take a closer look at its role not only in showcasing the history of this unique cycling-rich culture but in keeping that culture alive and relevant into the future.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-4-970x628.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclist Magazine issue 161\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-4-970x628.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-4-300x194.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-4-768x497.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-4-750x486.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-4-1140x738.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-161-4.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Our profile this issue has us chatting to Luke Rowe, a familiar face for more than a decade at Team Sky/Ineos Grenadiers who is now taking on the unfamiliar in his post-racing role as <em>directeur sportif</em> at French team Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale. And on the subject of new frontiers, we head to Sierra Leone to experience the Tour de Lunsar, a race that combines grassroots passion and international ambition to create a truly unique experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also in the April 2025 issue, we visit Blockhaus, the German-sounding climb in the heart of Italy, discover the merits of heat training, explore the latest generation of indoor framesets, go in-depth on BMC’s new Roadmachine 01 and test out new bikes from Look, Ridley and Ribble.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s plenty more to enjoy in the latest issue too, so pick up your copy on newsstands or <a href=\"https://shop.cyclist.co.uk/collections/coffee/products/issue-161\" target=\"_blank\">at the Cyclist Shop</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">get a <em>Cyclist</em> magazine subscription</a> to have every issue delivered free, straight to your door.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+5\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-5-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-5-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-5-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-5-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-5-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-5-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-5-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-5-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There are three levels of <em>Cyclist </em>subscriptions available.
