The law came into effect in September, but the exact details of what companies need to do to comply with it had not yet been fully drafted.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis month, Apple reportedly told the South Korean government that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/04/google-play-will-allow-alternative-billing/\">it was already complying</a> with the new law and did not need to change its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> policies. Jo Seoung-lae, the lawmaker who spearheaded the amendment, told <em>Reuters</em>:<blockquote>Frankly, we are not satisfied... Apple's claim that it's already complying is nonsensical. Excessive fees take away developers' chances for innovation ... parliament is to be closely informed as the government drafts detailed regulations to make sure there is accountability.</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt is as yet unclear how platform operators will be sanctioned if the regulations are breached, but according to a draft seen by <em>Reuters</em>, it could involve fines of up to two percent of revenue.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe initial details of what Apple will need to do to meet its new obligations in South Korea are expected to be made public by the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) tomorrow, ahead of them coming into full effect by March 2022.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn an interview at the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/11/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-speak-app-store-conference/\">Global Conference for Mobile Application Ecosystem Fairness</a> in Seoul today, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/\">Epic Games</a> CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/16/epic-games-ceo-calls-for-single-app-store/\">Tim Sweeney renewed his ongoing attack</a> on Apple and called for a single, universal app store. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/south-korea/\">South Korea</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/16/apple-not-doing-enough-for-south-korean-law/\">Apple Accused of Not Doing Enough to Comply With South Korean App Store Law</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-accused-of-not-doing-enough-to-comply-with-south-korean-app-store-law.2323600/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=uV0a41po9_s:oijzhf_XiLU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=uV0a41po9_s:oijzhf_XiLU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0a0fa858e4df8d3e4e55c04980c349be0b00fce2d965e316163bb425dd3196cd","category":"Apple"}
