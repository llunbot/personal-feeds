However, I can understand that he felt that step was important for his career.</p>\n<p>'We are a team that places a lot of value on cohesion, respect and sustainable cooperation, as we believe that these are the foundations for long-term success. You can have disagreements sometimes. However, as long as you treat each other with respect, you will always find each other again.</p>\n<p>'We have clear goals with Sam and I am confident that with our support he will be able to achieve several victories over the coming years. He is undisputably one of the very best sprinters in the world and has proven this by winning the green jersey at the 2020 Tour.'</p>\n<div>      <div>See relatedÂ </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/2104/vuelta-a-espana-route-race-reports-tv-guide-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Vuelta a Espana 2021: Route, start list, live TV guide and all we know so far</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9968/who-are-the-favourites-for-the-2021-vuelta-a-espana\">Who are the favourites for the 2021 Vuelta a Espana?</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/reviews/9969/book-review-vuelta-skelter-riding-the-remarkable-1941-tour-of-spain-by-tim-moore\">Book review: Vuelta Skelter: Riding the Remarkable 1941 Tour of Spain, by Tim Moore</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 117: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nBennett said, 'While some may have questioned my decision at the time, I believe it is the right move for me to return to Bora-Hansgrohe.</p>\n<p>'I have enjoyed two great years at Deceuninck-QuickStep, my boyhood dream team, and have continued my development both on and off the bike while making lifelong friendships.
