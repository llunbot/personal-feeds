{"title":"Track performance of serverless applications built using AWS Lambda with Application Signals","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/track-performance-of-serverless-applications-built-using-aws-lambda-with-application-signals/","date":1732222246000,"content":"<p>In November 2023, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-application-signals-for-automatic-instrumentation-of-your-applications-preview/\">we announced Amazon CloudWatch Application Signals</a>, an AWS built-in application performance monitoring (APM) solution, to solve the complexity associated with monitoring performance of distributed systems for applications hosted on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/pm/eks/\">Amazon EKS</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/\">Amazon ECS</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2/\">Amazon EC2</a>. Application Signals automatically correlates telemetry across metrics, traces, and logs, to speed up troubleshooting and reduce application disruption. By providing an integrated experience for analyzing performance in the context of your applications, Application Signals gives you improved productivity focusing on the applications that support your most critical business functions.</p> \n<p>Today we’re announcing the availability of Application Signals for AWS Lambda to eliminate the complexities of manual setup and performance issues required to assess application health for Lambda functions. With <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Application-Signals-Enable-Lambda.html\">CloudWatch Application Signals for Lambda</a>, you can now collect application golden metrics (the incoming and outgoing volume of requests, latency, faults, and errors).</p> \n<p>AWS Lambda abstracts away the complexity of the underlying infrastructure, enabling you to focus on building your application without having to monitor server health. This allows you to shift your focus toward monitoring the performance and health of your applications, which is necessary to operate your applications at peak performance and availability. This requires deep visibility into performance insights such as volume of transactions, latency spikes, availability drops, and errors for your critical business operations and application programming interfaces (APIs).</p> \n<p>Previously, you had to spend signiﬁcant time correlating disjointed logs, metrics, and traces across multiple tools to establish the root cause of anomalies, increasing mean time to recovery (MTTR) and operational costs. Additionally, building your own APM solutions with custom code or manual instrumentation using open source (OSS) libraries was time-consuming, complex, operationally expensive, and often resulted in increased cold start times and deployment challenges when managing large ﬂeets of Lambda functions. Now, you can use Application Signals to seamlessly monitor and troubleshoot health and performance issues in serverless applications, without requiring any manual instrumentation or code changes from your application developers.</p> \n<p><span><strong>How it works</strong></span><br /> Using the pre-built, standardized dashboards of Application Signals, you can identify the root cause of performance anomalies in just a few clicks by drilling down into performance metrics for critical business operations and APIs. This helps you visualize application topology which shows interactions between the function and its dependencies. In addition, you can define <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-ServiceLevelObjectives.html\">Service Level Objectives (SLOs)</a> on your applications to monitor specific operations that matter most to you. An example of an SLO could be to set a goal that a webpage should render within 2000 ms 99.9 percent of the time in a rolling 28-day interval.</p> \n<p>Application Signals auto-instruments your Lambda function using enhanced AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) libraries. This delivers better performance such as lower cold start latency,<br /> memory consumption, and function invocation duration, so you can quickly monitor your applications.</p> \n<p>I have an existing Lambda function <code>appsignals1</code> and I will configure Application Signals in the Lambda Console to collect various telemetry on this application.</p> \n<p>In the Configuration tab of the function I select <strong>Monitoring and operations tools</strong> to enable both the <strong>Application signals</strong> and the <strong>Lambda service traces</strong>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/15/screen1_1.png\"><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/15/screen1_1-1024x439.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"439\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/15/screen2-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/15/screen2-2-1024x394.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"394\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/15/screen1-4.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/15/screen1-4-1024x441.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"441\" /></a></p> \n<p>I have an application <code>myAppSignalsApp</code> that has this Lambda function <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/myApp-getting-started.html\">attached as a resource</a>.
