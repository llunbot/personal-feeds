The range is topped by the P3 and P4, which run on 26in and 27.5in wheels respectively.</p>\n<p>The P.Series range starts at £750/$650/€800 for the P1, with the P2 priced at £1,100/$1,250/€1,200, and the P3 and P4 both costing £1,400/$2,100/€1,700.</p>\n<p>The P3 and P4 framesets will also be available for £750/$700/€900.</p>\n<p>Specialized says the bikes are available to order now.</p>\n<h2>Increased versatility</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized P.Series range\" title=\"Specialized P.Series range\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Specialized says it has added greater versatility with the new P.Series range.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>It’s uncommon for a brand to release a dirt jump bike in more than one size. The P.Series <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/dirt-jump-bikes/\">dirt jump bike</a> hasn’t been updated since 2015, with the old bike focused solely on dirt jumping.</p>\n<p>While the new bike doesn’t steer away from this, Specialized says it has added more versatility with this new generation.</p>\n<p>The bikes are made from Specialized A1 aluminium and feature internal cable routing for a 30.9mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper post</a>. They can be fitted with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/a-complete-guide-to-rear-derailleurs/\">rear derailleur</a>.</p>\n<p>The brand says it wanted to make a bike that was capable of pedalling to the pump track, while still being able to perform on the jumps.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized P3\" title=\"Specialized P3\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> All P.Series bikes use Specialized’s premium A1 alloy and feature a threaded bottom bracket.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>All models in the range use a Boost-spaced 12x148mm sliding dropout that offers 15mm of adjustment for both geared and singlespeed setups to ensure the chain remains tensioned.</p>\n<p>Specialized says the Boost hub has made the bike more precise than the previous P.Series by adding more rigidity to the rear, while also opening up more aftermarket wheel choices.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized P1\" title=\"Specialized P1\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The P1 runs on 20in wheels and is designed for young mountain bikers.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>The P4 model uses a 27.5in wheel size, uncommon for dirt jump bikes, which have only relatively recently moved from 24in to 26in wheels.</p>\n<p>Specialized says it wanted to offer an option for larger riders, while also giving the bike characteristics more consistent with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike/\">mountain bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>The P3 and P4 are compatible with both 26in and 27.5in wheels, which means you could theoretically make the P4 into a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-faster-mullet-bike-29er/\">mullet</a> dirt jump bike.</p>\n<p>All of the models are based around a 100mm suspension fork, apart from the P1, which uses a rigid fork. However, Specialized says the frame has been geo corrected for an 80mm fork for future upgrades.</p>\n<h2>Specialized P.Series spec and price details</h2>\n<h3>Specialized P1</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized P1\" title=\"Specialized P1\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The P1 has SRAM Level T hydraulic disc brakes on the front and rear.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Fork:</strong> Rigid A1 aluminium</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> Singlespeed</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> SRAM Level T</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Specialized P.Series, 20in</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Specialized Kicker Sport, 20×2.1in</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £750</li>\n</ul><h3>Specialized P2</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized P2\" title=\"Specialized P2\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> All models come with Specialized’s Kicker Sport tyres.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Fork:</strong> Manitou J-Unit Comp, 100mm</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> Singlespeed</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> SRAM Level T</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Specialized P.Series, 24in</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Specialized Kicker Sport, 24×2.1in</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £1,100</li>\n</ul><h3>Specialized P3</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized P3\" title=\"Specialized P3\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The P3 is available in Desert Rose or Black.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Fork:</strong> Marzocchi Bomber DJ, 100mm</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> Singlespeed</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> SRAM Level T</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Specialized P.Series, 26in</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Specialized Kicker Sport, 26×2.1in</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £1,400</li>\n</ul><h3>Specialized P4</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized P4\" title=\"Specialized P4\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The P4 is one of the few 27.5in dirt jump bikes on the market.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Fork:</strong> Marzocchi Bomber DJ, 100mm</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> Singlespeed</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> SRAM Level T</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Specialized P.Series, 27.5in</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Specialized Kicker Sport, 27.5×2.1in</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £1,400</li>\n</ul>","author":"Nick Clark","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"f0e83f7de0a42c8410c64a6dc4c0bdb3853d32728acfc8b07bbff6d57885c9d2","category":"Cycling"}
