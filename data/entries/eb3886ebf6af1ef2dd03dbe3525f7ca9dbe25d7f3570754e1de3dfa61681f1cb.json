Starting today, Waymos will be cruising around Manhattan, going through the Lincoln Tunnel, visiting Times Square, driving by Central Park, and doing other usual New York City tourist stuff.</p>\n<p>Note that Waymo is <em>mapping</em> New York City, not autonomously driving there. Safety drivers will be behind the wheel, manually controlling the vehicles at all times. The self-driving sensors will be on full blast, though, and they will scan every nook and cranny of the company's New York City territory to create a detailed self-driving map. Once the map is built, Waymo will load the city data into a simulation to see how the \"Waymo Driver\" software reacts to daily life in NYC. Then the company can tweak, test, and improve its software safely.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810316#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810316&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"eb3886ebf6af1ef2dd03dbe3525f7ca9dbe25d7f3570754e1de3dfa61681f1cb","category":"Tech"}
