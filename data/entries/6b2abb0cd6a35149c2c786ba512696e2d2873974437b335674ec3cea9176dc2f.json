This code holds an important place in\nhistory and is a fascinating read of an operating system that was\nwritten entirely in 8086 assembly code nearly 45 years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Today, in partnership with IBM and in the spirit of open\ninnovation, we’re releasing the source code to MS-DOS 4.00 under\nthe MIT license. There’s a somewhat complex and fascinating\nhistory behind the 4.0 versions of DOS, as Microsoft partnered\nwith IBM for portions of the code but also created a branch of DOS\ncalled Multitasking DOS that did not see a wide release.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am reminded once again that I somehow managed to get a computer science degree despite being utterly baffled by assembly code.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/27/open-source-ms-dos-4\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6b2abb0cd6a35149c2c786ba512696e2d2873974437b335674ec3cea9176dc2f","category":"Tech"}
