Instead, he said, the agency must get back to the basics and get to the Moon as fast as possible. China, which has a competing lunar program, must not be allowed to beat NASA and its allies back to the Moon. The space agency, he said, needed to \"restart\" the Moon program and chuck out all of the commercial space nonsense.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996618#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996618&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"59fcaed89faebb5ccade94e8ff1af26011a21794649159e3a55dd5816379216e","category":"Tech"}
