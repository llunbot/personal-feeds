{"title":"Apple's 140W Power Adapter is Company's First GaN Charger, Supports USB-C Power Delivery 3.1","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/19/apple-140w-power-adapter-usb-pd-3-1/","date":1634649060000,"content":"Apple has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734233/apple-140w-macbook-charging-brick-gan-usb-c-pd-3-1-third-party-chargers\">confirmed to <em>The Verge</em></a> that its new 140W USB-C power adapter is the company's first charger <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/04/apple-gan-chargers-rumor/\">based on gallium nitride or \"GaN\" technology</a>, which allows for smaller, lighter, and more power efficient chargers than silicon-based chargers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/apple-140w-power-adapter.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWithout the use of GaN, the 140W power adapter likely would have been fairly larger given its wattage. Many other brands like Anker and Belkin have introduced GaN-based chargers over the last few years for use with Apple products.  \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple also confirmed that the 140W power adapter supports the USB-C Power Delivery 3.1 standard, meaning that it can be used to charge other devices that support that standard. It also means that those who buy the new 16-inch MacBook Pro can use compatible chargers from third-party brands to charge the notebook if they prefer.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe continue to learn smaller details about the new MacBook Pro models that Apple didn't mention during its \"Unleashed\" event, including that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/19/16-inch-macbook-pro-fast-charge-magsafe-only/\">fast charging is only possible with the MagSafe port on the new 16-inch MacBook Pro</a>, whereas the 14-inch model can be fast charged using either MagSafe or any of the Thunderbolt 4 ports. This shouldn't be a big deal given that the MagSafe port has no other use than charging, but it's worth knowing.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nKey features of the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro include Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/apple-macbook-pro-lineup-no-intel-chips/\">next-generation M1 Pro and M1 Max chips</a>, the return of an HDMI port and SD card slot, mini-LED displays with a ProMotion adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz, up to 10 hours longer battery life, and more. The notebooks can be ordered now and launch on Tuesday, October 26.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's new 140W power adapter is included with the new 16-inch MacBook Pro and it is also <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLYU3AM/A/140w-usb-c-power-adapter\">sold separately for $99</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">13\" MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">14\" and 16\" MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/19/apple-140w-power-adapter-usb-pd-3-1/\">Apple's 140W Power Adapter is Company's First GaN Charger, Supports USB-C Power Delivery 3.1</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-140w-power-adapter-is-companys-first-gan-charger-supports-usb-c-power-delivery-3-1.2317927/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fmW0rjug1JE:QJQa0QHzKaE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fmW0rjug1JE:QJQa0QHzKaE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/fmW0rjug1JE\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ef6568e3105aa6e821eaa0ff5553641372378d7ca21a49988e846a2967b4a0a8","category":"Apple"}
