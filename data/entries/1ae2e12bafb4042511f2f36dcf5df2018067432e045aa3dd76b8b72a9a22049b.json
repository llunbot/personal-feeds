Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>MUNICH—Audi's new electric car platform is an important one for the company. Debuting in the new 2025 Q6 e-tron, it will provide the bones for many new electric Audis—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/porsche-gives-ars-a-look-inside-its-next-ev-the-all-electric-macan/\">not to mention Porsches</a> and even Lamborghinis and Bentleys—in the coming years.
