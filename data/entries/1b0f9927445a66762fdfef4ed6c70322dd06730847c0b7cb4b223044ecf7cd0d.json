FIFA will launch a revamped version of Club World Cup in 2025, and Apple wants the TV rights. Club World Cup 2025 will feature 32 teams from each of the six confederations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/fifa.jpg\" width=\"1535\" height=\"863\" />\r<br />\nAn agreement between Apple and FIFA could be announced as soon as this month, and the first tournament will take place in the United States next summer. Apple could be paying around $1 billion, and <em>The New York Times</em> says it is not yet clear if there will be any free-to-air rights. If not, the entire tournament could be available only to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV+</a> subscribers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has already shelled out $2.5 billion to secure global broadcasting rights to Major League Soccer. MLS and League Cup games are streamed on ‌Apple TV+‌, with access priced at $14.99 per month or $99 per season for non-subscribers and $12.99 per month or $79 per season for those who subscribe to ‌Apple TV+‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple sees live sports as a way to lure new customers to the ‌Apple TV+‌ streaming service. In addition to the MLS deal, it has also secured a deal with Major League Baseball. Apple negotiated for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/19/apple-quits-nfl-sunday-ticket-negotiations/\">NFL Sunday Ticket access</a>, and while that didn't work out, a report from <em><a href=\"https://theathletic.com/5430093/2024/04/22/nba-tv-rights-amazon-nbc/\">The Athletic</a></em> suggests that Apple is still in the running to secure some streaming access to NBA games.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this year, Apple introduced a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/apple-sports-app-hands-on/\">dedicated Apple Sports app</a> that allows users to get real-time scores and stats for their favorite teams. The app is able to sync with the My Sports experience in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> app.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fifa/\">FIFA</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-sports/\">Apple Sports</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/apple-fifa-tournament-rights/\">Apple Working to Secure Streaming Rights to FIFA Club World Cup</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-working-to-secure-streaming-rights-to-fifa-club-world-cup.2424683/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1b0f9927445a66762fdfef4ed6c70322dd06730847c0b7cb4b223044ecf7cd0d","category":"Apple"}
