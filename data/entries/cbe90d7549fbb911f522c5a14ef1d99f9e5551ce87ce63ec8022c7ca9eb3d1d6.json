{"title":"Take a Hot Lap & Try On Handup’s First Women’s Specific MTB Shorts","link":"https://bikerumor.com/handup-hot-lap-womens-short/","date":1684168864000,"content":"<p>Handup’s Hot Lap shorts are designed to not only fit women but give them pockets that “actually work!” We all can get behind that, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company introduced their first women-specific mountain biking outer shorts to us in a simple overview. They’re a redesign of its <a href=\"https://handupgloves.com/collections/shorts/products/a-t-plus-short-obsidian\" target=\"_blank\">A.T. (All Time) Plus shorts</a>, and they come in only one color (<em>for now</em>), plus five sizes from 0/2-10/12. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Handup Hot Lap women-specific mountain bike shorts</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.09.46-AM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.09.46-AM-800x534.png\" alt=\"a woman standing over a mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.09.46-AM-800x534.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.09.46-AM-297x198.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.09.46-AM-120x80.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.09.46-AM-768x512.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.09.46-AM-1536x1025.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.09.46-AM-720x480.png 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.09.46-AM.png 1923w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s the first time Handup has built shorts specifically for women. But anyone who thought the A.T. Plus were good shorts will likely think the same here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Virtually nothing changes between the A.T. Plus and the Hot Lap — there’s the same 90% nylon, 10% Spandex fabric, the same pocket setup, the same belt loops. Just, the Hot Lap’s inseam is 7 inches “to ensure no seat chafing,” Handup said.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.06.51-AM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"475\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.06.51-AM-800x475.png\" alt=\"hot lap shorts with attributes indicated\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.06.51-AM-800x475.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.06.51-AM-297x176.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.06.51-AM-120x71.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.06.51-AM-768x456.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.06.51-AM-1536x912.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.06.51-AM-2048x1216.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stated purpose: “<em>adventures that put a beating on your gear</em>,” or “<em>margarita happy hour as well!</em>”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.10.16-AM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"516\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.10.16-AM-800x516.png\" alt=\"&quot;happy hour&quot; in hot lap shorts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.10.16-AM-800x516.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.10.16-AM-297x192.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.10.16-AM-120x77.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.10.16-AM-768x496.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.10.16-AM-1536x991.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-12-at-10.10.16-AM.png 1991w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing like a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/handup-spring-2023-apparel/\" target=\"_blank\">sun-splashed happy hour</a> with HandUp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get the Hot Lap shorts for women in obsidian now for $49 MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://handupgloves.com/collections/womens-hot-lap-shorts/products/womens-a-t-plus-short-obsidian\" target=\"_blank\">HandUp.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/handup-hot-lap-womens-short/\">Take a Hot Lap &amp; Try On Handup’s First Women’s Specific MTB Shorts</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Sam Anderson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"cbe90d7549fbb911f522c5a14ef1d99f9e5551ce87ce63ec8022c7ca9eb3d1d6","category":"Cycling"}
