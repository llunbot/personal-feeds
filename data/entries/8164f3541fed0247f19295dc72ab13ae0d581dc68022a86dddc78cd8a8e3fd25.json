The survey assessed Americans' attitudes toward space exploration and space policy issues.</p>\n<p>Similarly <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/06/nasas-priorities-appear-to-be-out-of-whack-with-what-the-public-wants/\">to five years ago</a>, the survey found that Americans broadly support the national space agency, NASA. Three-quarters of respondents had a favorable opinion of NASA, compared to just 9 percent with an unfavorable opinion.</p>\n<p>However, as several previous surveys have found, the public has far different priorities for NASA than are expressed in the space agency's budget. In this new report, based on a large survey of 10,329 US adults, the highest support came for \"monitor asteroids, other objects that could hit the Earth\" (60 percent) and \"monitor key parts of the Earth's climate system\" (50 percent). Sending astronauts to the Moon (12 percent) and Mars (11 percent) lagged far behind as top priorities for respondents.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955310#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955310&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8164f3541fed0247f19295dc72ab13ae0d581dc68022a86dddc78cd8a8e3fd25","category":"Tech"}
