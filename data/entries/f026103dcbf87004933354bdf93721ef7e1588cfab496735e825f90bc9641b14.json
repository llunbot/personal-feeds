The other was the much more plebeian Chevrolet Bolt, which was cheaper but nowhere near as luxurious, nor as enjoyable to drive. Now, some I-Pace and Bolt owners have something else in common, as Jaguar issues a recall for some model-year 2019 I-Paces due to a fire risk, probably caused by badly folded battery anode tabs.</p>\n<p>The problem doesn't affect all I-Paces, just those built between January 9, 2018, and March 14, 2019—2,760 cars in total in the US. To date, three fires have been reported following software updates, which <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCLRPT-24V633-9392.PDF\">Jaguar's recall report</a> says does not provide \"an appropriate level of protection for the 2019MY vehicles in the US.\"</p>\n<p>Although Jaguar's investigation is still ongoing, it says that its battery supplier (LG Energy Solutions) is inspecting some battery modules that were identified by diagnostic software as \"having characteristics of a folded anode tab.\" In 2021, problems with LG batteries—in this case, folded separators and torn anode tabs—resulted in Chevrolet <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/08/gm-recalls-every-chevy-bolt-ever-made-blames-lg-for-faulty-batteries/\">recalling every Bolt on the road</a> and replacing their batteries under warranty at a cost of more than $1.8 billion.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046383#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046383&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
