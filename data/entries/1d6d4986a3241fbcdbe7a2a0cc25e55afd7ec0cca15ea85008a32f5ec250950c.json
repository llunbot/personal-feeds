The Apple Watch band itself is \"Cloud\" white and features a personalized \"J50\" monogram engraved on the ceramic pin in silver lettering. Ive departed Apple in June 2019 and now runs an independent design firm called LoveFrom. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Story goes that this unique Cloud Sport Band would've originally come with a Ceramic 42mm Series 2 Watch as a gift to Jony Ive for his 50th birthday, hence the \"I50\" engraved on the pin. Allegedly around 10 or so exist, most are a test batch with the finalized one given to Ive <a href=\"https://t.co/pfPPfcSRUT\">pic.twitter.com/pfPPfcSRUT</a></p>— Stella - Fudge (@StellaFudge) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StellaFudge/status/1747670861501378963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 17, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the Sport Band has been a ubiquitous style for the Apple Watch since its introduction in 2014, only some models feature engraved pins, such as the Apple Watch Hermès and Black Unity band. These are invisible when the band is worn on the wrist but provide a subtle indication of the model's special nature to the owner.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe white ceramic ‌Apple Watch Series 2‌ was the first of its kind, expanding to a new gray version with the Series 3. While there was no ceramic Apple Watch Edition for Series 4 models, Apple revived the high-end white ceramic Edition model for the Series 5 in 2019 – the last time we've seen the material used on the device. The ceramic Apple Watch Edition was markedly cheaper than its 24K gold predecessor, but it remains one of the most striking and beloved casings ever offered by Apple.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jony-ive/\">Jony Ive</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/prototypes/\">Prototypes</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/rare-apple-watch-band-designed-for-jony-ive/\">Images of Ultra-Rare Apple Watch Band Designed for Sir Jony Ive Surface Online</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/images-of-ultra-rare-apple-watch-band-designed-for-sir-jony-ive-surface-online.2416684/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1d6d4986a3241fbcdbe7a2a0cc25e55afd7ec0cca15ea85008a32f5ec250950c","category":"Apple"}
