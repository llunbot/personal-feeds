And today they’re even cheaper than that: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX542AM-A-AirTag-Pack/dp/B0932QJ2JZ/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling a four-pack of AirTags for $79</a>, a savings of $20 and one of the best prices we’ve ever seen. Just be sure to click the coupon box under the price in the listing to save an extra buck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AirTags are <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/346345/apple-airtag-review.html\">small circular Bluetooth trackers</a> that add Find My support to keys, wallets, and other non-Apple items. They connect to the Find My app just like an iPhone or MacBook and alert you when the thing the AirTag is attached to is left behind. They’re small enough to pop into a pocket or a small bag, and most importantly, if something with an AirTag is lost or stolen, you can use the vast Find My network to find it. Just note, that if you want to attach an AirTag to a set of keys or zipper, you’ll <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirTag-FineWoven-Key-Ring/dp/B0CHX48MK6?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">need a separate holder</a> as the AirTag doesn’t have a hole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This deal brings the price of each AirTag down to just $20, which is cheaper than a similar Tile tracker. So go grab a pack before the price shoots back up.</p>\n\nMobile Phone Accessories</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b5b72688fc491f780568615350da2557cbf61031b347c8039d0a886806ca8b8f","category":"Apple"}
