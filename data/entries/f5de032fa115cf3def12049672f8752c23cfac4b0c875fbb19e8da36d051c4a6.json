This time, when you buy any Solo Loop or Braided Solo Loop at a discount on Woot, you'll get up to two extra bands for free.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/apple-watch-bands-january.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Woot.

You start by selecting the size of the band and Apple Watch model, then Woot will randomly select three Solo Loop bands or two Braided Solo Loop bands to send to you.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWoot guarantees that each band will be a unique color and there will be no duplicate colors in each box. These are also in new condition and come individually packaged in their original Apple retail packaging, as well as with a one year Apple manufacturer limited warranty.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlthough there's a bit of risk at play in Woot's new sale, these are massive discounts on the Apple Watch bands, and it's a great way to expand your band collection and try out new colors. This sale will run through April 25 at 11:59 p.m. Central Time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you're on the hunt for more discounts, be sure to visit our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a> roundup where we recap the best Apple-related bargains of the past week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<hr />\r<br />\n<div>\r<br />\n<h3>Deals Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nInterested in hearing more about the best deals you can find in 2025? <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/itTnTk\">Sign up</a> for our Deals Newsletter and we'll keep you updated so you don't miss the biggest deals of the season!\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div><div></div><div></div></div>\r<br />\n</div><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/woots-new-apple-watch-band-sale/\">Woot's New Apple Watch Solo/Braided Loop Sale Offers Up to Two Free Bands When You Buy One</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/woots-new-apple-watch-solo-braided-loop-sale-offers-up-to-two-free-bands-when-you-buy-one.2455768/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Mitchel Broussard","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f5de032fa115cf3def12049672f8752c23cfac4b0c875fbb19e8da36d051c4a6","category":"Apple"}
