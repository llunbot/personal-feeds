But while much of this trip has found him wondering at the vastness of the steppe, this closing section shows a different side of the country.

Maybe it was the golden trees all around town after crossing such a desolate stretch of steppe, or maybe it was the Korean restaurant serving up a ridiculously good Jeyuk Bokkeum. I’d grown a bit tired of the usual mountain of sheep meat with rice, so this was quite a nice change of pace.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, when I looked at the calendar, with limited days on my visa and a forecast showing the temperatures dropping off of a cliff, I knew I couldn’t afford the extra time resting that I wanted if I hoped to finish the last 600-kilometer stretch of riding.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-06.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" width=\"412\" height=\"275\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-06.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-06.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-06.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-06.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-06.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-06.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-06.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-06.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-06.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-11.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" width=\"391\" height=\"261\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-11.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-11.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-11.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-11.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-11.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-11.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-11.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-11.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-11.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>I left town, with some reluctance, along another track from Brigitte &amp; Ivo over at <a href=\"http://bikepackground.com/\">bikepackground.com</a> that would send me north toward the Khövsgöl region. The first stretch entailed heading down an 80-kilometer dead-end valley that would require a good old-fashioned hike-a-bike to link up a couple of classic Mongolian grassy tracks. The impassable (by car, at least) nature of this road meant that there wouldn’t be a whole lot of traffic, save for some local shepherds, which was fine by me.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-08.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-08.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-08.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-08.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-08.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-08.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-08.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-08.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-08.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-08.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>After a couple of hours meandering my way up a valley dotted with autumnal trees and a handful of yaks here and there, I finally crossed paths with a local who was curious to find out where I was heading. “Ider,” I said in response to their puzzled face. It was a small town on the other side of the hike-a-bike section. The man in the truck still looked confused by this, but a shepherd who had walked up to see what the fuss was about knew what I was talking about, making a swooping motion with his hand to indicate the section I’d have to push over to reach another road.</p>\n<p>Still, he shook his head with that classic “Are you SURE this is the way you want to go?!” look on his face. No words were needed. I laughed and the driver of the truck rummaged behind his seat for a bag that had a few apples in it and handed it to me before saying something in Mongolian that I didn’t understand at all, but I assumed was something along the lines of “good luck, you’re gonna need it.” Maybe they were right.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-13.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-13.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-13.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-13.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-13.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-13.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-13.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-13.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-13.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-13.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>As I continued up the gentle climb through the valley, the smattering of trees that surrounded the river gave way to larger patches of golden forest covering much of the surrounding hillsides. It felt like a different planet from the desolate dunes I’d been riding through just days before.</p>\n<p>The onslaught of fall color coming from every direction was another stark reminder of the changing seasons in Mongolia. I’d had quite decent luck with the weather since I’d been here, spending most of my days frolicking through the hills in my sandals, but that was about to change in a hurry, as it tends to do around here.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-12.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-12.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-12.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-12.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-12.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-12.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-12.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-12.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-12.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-12.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>Evening set in and, as shadow overtook the valley, I started eyeing up places to camp. There were a few shepherds out wrangling their herds back to their Ger (yurt-like structures) camps, but I managed to find a spot near the river where it looked like another Ger camp had recently been taken down for winter.</p>\n<p>The next morning I continued up the valley, eventually having to turn off the road to head 350 vertical meters over the grassy hillside. The path wasn’t clear, the ground was swampy, and most of the time it felt like I was probably going the wrong way. However, I was too committed to go back down and find a better path, so I kept at it until I eventually reached the summit and joined the actual goat path that I probably should have been on in the first place.</p>\n<p>The wind was hammering at the pass about as strong as I’d felt in Mongolia so far, which gave me a good sense that the weather was indeed about to change as I’d seen on the forecast a couple of days before, and the sky and turned a hazy white.</p>\n<p>The track was once again unclear after reaching the valley floor on the other side. I found myself crossing a stream back and forth, searching for the path of least resistance across the swampy grass field. Another hour of this went by before the faint tracks in the grass turned into more obvious tire tracks, and I was able to improve my glacial pace.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-23.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-23.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-23.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-23.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-23.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-23.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-23.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-23.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-23.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-23.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>Soon I was on a fully-fledged dirt road and the village of Ider, my goal, was nearly in my sights. I’d made it over the pass just in time because on the way down I started getting pelted with freezing rain. Looking back, the hills I’d just trekked over were already covered in a layer of snow. Suddenly I was very thankful that I didn’t take those extra couple of days in Uliastai.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-24.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-24.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-24.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-24.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-24.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-24.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-24.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-24.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-24.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-24.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>I lucked into finding a little hotel in town and settled in for a couple of nights as two full days of miserable weather came through town. I had to bundle up into all of my clothes just to walk five minutes to the shop from the hotel, with the temperature plummeting to around -15°C at night. I decided to make some adjustments to my route to give me one more decent sized town along my route, Tosontsengel, to pass through before I’d enter the Khövsgöl region. That would give me one extra warm-ish night in a heated hotel room.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-27.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-27.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-27.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-27.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-27.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-27.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-27.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-27.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-27.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-27.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-29.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" width=\"402\" height=\"268\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-29.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-29.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-29.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-29.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-29.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-29.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-29.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-29.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-29.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-26.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" width=\"402\" height=\"268\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-26.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-26.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-26.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-26.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-26.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-26.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-26.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-26.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-26.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>I rode out of town in the morning with a bitter wind already blowing.

After a couple of hours, the temperatures crept above freezing, and I could make some decent time working my way along the river, before plunging through it myself, and watching a local cattle herder chase his animals around to get them in order.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-30.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-30.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-30.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-30.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-30.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-30.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-30.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-30.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-30.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_TheNorth-30.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>Before I knew it the road once again randomly turned to singletrack and cut through the forest.

It was clear that most of the people around this region, one of the coldest in Mongolia, had already packed up and headed elsewhere as I didn’t see another person until basically two straight days of riding later in the small village of Tsagaan Uul.</p>\n<p>Winter’s approach is only one of the reasons this area was so empty though. Much of Mongolia’s population has left these small countryside settlements to look for opportunities in the expanding urban sprawl of Ulaanbaatar. Nowadays, livestock outnumber humans in these areas by a ratio of about 100:1. Most of the villages around have declined in population by 15-20% over the last 20 years or so while Ulaanbaatar’s population has more than doubled in that time.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\"
