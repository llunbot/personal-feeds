The updated draft of the \"<a href=\"https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/\">AI Act</a>\" law includes a ban on the use of AI in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/11/23719694/eu-ai-act-draft-approved-prohibitions-surveillance-predictive-policing\">biometric surveillance</a> and requires systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT to reveal when content has been generated by AI. While the draft is still non-binding, it gives a strong indication of how EU regulators are thinking about AI.</p>\n<p>The new changes to the European Commission's proposed law—which have not yet been finalized—intend to shield EU citizens from potential threats linked to machine learning technology.</p>\n\n<p>The changes come amid the proliferation of generative AI systems that imitate human conversational abilities, such as OpenAI's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/openai-invites-everyone-to-test-new-ai-powered-chatbot-with-amusing-results/\">ChatGPT</a> and GPT-4, which have triggered controversial <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/fearing-loss-of-control-ai-critics-call-for-6-month-pause-in-ai-development/\">calls for action</a> among AI scientists and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/openai-execs-warn-of-risk-of-extinction-from-artificial-intelligence-in-new-open-letter/\">industry executives</a> regarding potential societal risks. However, the EU's proposed AI Act is over 2 years old, so it isn't just a knee-jerk response to AI hype. It includes provisions that guard against other types of AI harm that are more grounded in the here and now than a hypothetical <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-checked-to-see-whether-gpt-4-could-take-over-the-world/\">AI takeover</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948103#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948103&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7cde7c435a73376be4bd92859146f5cbf97710a143f8b5d093272c51006d0c09","category":"Tech"}
