The networks are due to be switched off as part of plans to accelerate the roll out of 5G across the country. The UK government added that the move also paves the way for future 6G services.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the number of people reliant on 2G and 3G networks is relatively low, retiring them will allow operators to reclaim spectrum to be used in 4G and 5G networks, as well as save money being spent on powering and maintaining inefficient legacy equipment. 2G may remain in use for longer than 3G because it offers wide coverage and comparatively low power requirements which make it ideal for some IoT deployments.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the United States, carriers have begun a similar process, with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/30/verizon-3g-shutdown-december-2022/\">Verizon planning to shut down its 3G network</a> on December 31, 2022.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the original <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> from 2007 supported 2G networks, the ‌iPhone‌ did not support 3G until the device's second generation. Such was the importance of 3G connectivity to the second-generation ‌iPhone‌ that it was called the \"‌iPhone‌ 3G.\" The ‌iPhone‌ did not get 4G until the launch of the ‌iPhone‌ 5 in 2012, and the drive toward 5G across the industry did not gather pace until the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> lineup last year.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/uk-to-shut-down-2g-and-3g-networks-by-2033/\">UK to Shut Down 2G and 3G Networks by 2033</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/uk-to-shut-down-2g-and-3g-networks-by-2033.2326695/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Lly1-jpUg94:-moHeO_Zi7U:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Lly1-jpUg94:-moHeO_Zi7U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c35ea1cf10e02b3964dc2138a5a8c5c7a090718afc256b9ed982cb308c22dee6","category":"Apple"}
