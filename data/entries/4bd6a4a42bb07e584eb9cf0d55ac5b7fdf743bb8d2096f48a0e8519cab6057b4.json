Dumb like when you laugh uncontrollably at the sight of someone getting conked on the head and falling over backward. Dumb as in the silliest bits of <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i>, just nowhere near as self-aware (unless, due to translation issues, this game actually is self-aware, then I apologize).</p>\n<p><i>Dragon’s Dogma 2</i> (<em>DD2</em>) reminds me of playing another huge, dumb, enjoyable game: <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/11/skyrim-sells-a-reported-35-million-units-in-2-days-shows-demand-for-single-player-gaming/\"><i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i></a>. Not the first time you play through it, though. I’m talking about the second or third run-through (or that 100-plus-hour save in which you refuse to finish the game), and your admiration of this huge, rich world gives way to utter ridiculousness. You one-shot dragons with your <a href=\"https://www.thegamer.com/skyrim-stealth-archer-build/\">broken stealth-archer build</a>, you put <a href=\"https://www.escapistmagazine.com/skyrim-bucket-robbery-is-a-testament-to-player-creativity/\">buckets on the heads of NPCs</a> to rob them, and you marvel at how the most effective fast travel is <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/skyrims-horse-tilting-glitch-redefines-fast-travel-1788754191\">horse tilting</a>. You lunge into possibilities, choose chaos, and appreciate all the ways you can do so.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012266#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012266&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4bd6a4a42bb07e584eb9cf0d55ac5b7fdf743bb8d2096f48a0e8519cab6057b4","category":"Tech"}
