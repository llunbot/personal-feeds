In a\n<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-directs-facebook-to-sell-giphy\">press release</a>, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)\nsaid that it had come to the decision after its investigation\nfound an acquisition could harm competition between social media\nplatforms, and that its concerns “can only be addressed by\nFacebook selling Giphy in its entirety to an approved buyer.”</p>\n\n<p>The CMA said the acquisition could be used to deny or limit other\nplatforms’ access to Giphy GIFs and drive more traffic to\nFacebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. It also raised concerns that it\ncould be used to require other platforms to provide more data to\naccess the GIFs. Finally, the CMA also believes that Giphy’s\nadvertising services could have competed with Meta’s, but that\nthese were shuttered as a result of the merger.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Can you imagine Facebook trying to buy Instagram or WhatsApp now? I mean if even the Giphy acquisition is now considered problematic — Giphy! — imagine something bigger.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/12/01/facebook-giphy-uk\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6490a15d600996fed5fee03e5cf8d87251d321bc44d5a0866b25faf529e14a12","category":"Tech"}
