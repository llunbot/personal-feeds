But I\nreally wanted Gruber to talk about Apple’s big picture and how a\ncompany that so often prides itself on doing the right thing ended\nup so fully on the wrong side of the courts.</p>\n\n<p>One theme you’ll hear throughout this conversation is that Apple\noften presents itself as small, but the company is actually huge\nin every way — Apple now sells nearly as many phones in a single\nquarter as it did in the entire first three years of the iPhone’s\nexistence combined.

And perhaps most importantly, Apple\nhas control over applications on the iPhone, which means it has\ncontrol over what kinds of businesses can and cannot exist on its\nmobile phones.</p>\n\n<p>That’s the context for the other major theme here that you’ll pick\nup on in this conversation: Apple’s major shift toward digital\nservices and whether that’s fundamentally changed the company’s\nculture.
