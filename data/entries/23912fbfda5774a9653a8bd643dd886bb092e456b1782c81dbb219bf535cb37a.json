In November, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/06/gurman-siri-trigger-phrase/\">Gurman reported</a> that Apple is working on a way for ‌Siri‌ to be able to understand and respond to commands without the need to use \"Hey ‌Siri‌\" as a trigger-phrase. Instead, users will simply need to say \"‌Siri‌.\"<blockquote>The company is working on an initiative to drop the \"Hey in the trigger phrase so that a user only needs to say \"Siri\"—along with a command. While that might seem like a small change, making the switch is a technical challenge that requires a significant amount of AI training and underlying engineering work. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe complexity involves Siri being able to understand the singular phrase \"Siri\" in multiple different accents and dialects. Having two words — \"Hey Siri\" — increases the likelihood of the system properly picking up the signal.</blockquote>The change would bring ‌Siri‌ closer to Amazon's voice assistant, which can be triggered simply by beginning a command with \"Alexa.\" At the time, Gurman added that Apple is also working on deeper ‌Siri‌ integrations with third-party apps and services to provide better assistance thanks to additional context.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman initially said that the changes to ‌Siri‌ are expected to roll out sometime in 2023 or 2024, but his latest tweet suggests that it remains a distinct possibility for WWDC next week. Apple's mixed-reality headset is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/27/report-details-turmoil-behind-siri-and-apple-ai/\">rumored to feature voice controls</a>, so improvements to ‌Siri‌ would likely go hand-in-hand with the announcement of the new device.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/03/apple-may-drop-hey-siri-phrase-at-wwdc/\">Gurman: Apple May Announce Drop of 'Hey Siri' Trigger Phrase at WWDC</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-apple-may-announce-drop-of-hey-siri-trigger-phrase-at-wwdc.2391430/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"23912fbfda5774a9653a8bd643dd886bb092e456b1782c81dbb219bf535cb37a","category":"Apple"}
