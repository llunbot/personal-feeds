We look forward\nto engaging with you and your administration to help make sure the\nUnited States continues to lead with and be fueled by ingenuity,\ninnovation, and creativity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I wonder how much Cook dithered over that cheerful-looking exclamation mark. I hope he regrets it. I wonder whether the latter four knowingly made the error of addressing former president and president-elect Trump as “President Trump”. Our nation only has one president at a time, and that president remains Joe Biden. I wonder how much it stings to be reminded that all the money in the world cannot buy dignity. I wonder too, what taste Cheetos-dusted 78-year-old testicles leave in one’s mouth. Whatever the flavor, I hope it lingers.</p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"38a50f054586a52f2bb17b1289055f7886e0de652edfd3a5c251dcf407ca7975","category":"Tech"}
