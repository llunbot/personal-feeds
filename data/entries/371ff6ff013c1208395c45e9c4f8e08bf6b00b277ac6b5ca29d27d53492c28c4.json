Apple \nantitrust case. The court battle to open iOS to competing stores \nand payments is lost in the United States. A sad outcome for all \ndevelopers. </p>\n\n<p>Now the District Court’s injunction against Apple’s anti-steering \nrule is in effect, and developers can include in their apps \n“buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct \ncustomers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to IAP”. </p>\n\n<p>As of today, developers can begin exercising their \ncourt-established right to tell US customers about better prices \non the web. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s sad for Epic, perhaps, and game developers in general, but I think overall this is a good day for developers, and a great day for users. In-app game purchases are already too predatory, as things stand — they’d get far worse if games on iOS were free to circumvent Apple’s system. If a developer wants users to sign up and pay on their website, than can now tell them so, in plain language, in the app.</p>\n\n<p>The truth should never be against the rules. If you need to pay/subscribe on the app’s website, the app should be able to tell you that you need to pay/subscribe on their website.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/16/sweeney\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"371ff6ff013c1208395c45e9c4f8e08bf6b00b277ac6b5ca29d27d53492c28c4","category":"Tech"}
