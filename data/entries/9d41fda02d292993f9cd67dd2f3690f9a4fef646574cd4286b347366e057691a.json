This change was first made to the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe teardown provides a brief glimpse at the iPhone 15 Pro Max's upgraded Telephoto lens with a tetraprism system, which enables 5x optical zoom. iFixit said the Main and Ultra Wide lenses on the device appear to look the same as the ones on the iPhone 14 Pro Max, in line with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tech_Reve/status/1705409878481908094\">information shared on social media</a> last week. This suggests camera improvements beyond 5x optical zoom are the result of the A17 Pro chip and software optimizations. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\niFixit says the iPhone 15 Pro Max has a similar logic board as the iPhone 15 Pro. In addition to the A17 Pro chip, the teardown confirms that the device is equipped with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X70 modem, which <a href=\"https://speedsmart.net/blog/post/2005/iPhone-15-Pro-up-to-24-Faster-5G-Download-Speeds\">reportedly enables faster 5G speeds</a> as expected.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOverall, iFixit gave the iPhone 15 Pro Max a low repairability score of 4/10, in part due to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/19/ifixit-lowers-iphone-14-repairability-score/\">Apple's parts pairing requirement</a> that it says harms independent repair shops.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ifixit/\">iFixit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/teardown/\">Teardown</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-15-pro-max-teardown-ifixit/\">iPhone 15 Pro Max Teardown: X70 Modem for Faster 5G, 5x Optical Zoom Lens, A17 Pro Chip, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-max-teardown-x70-modem-for-faster-5g-5x-optical-zoom-lens-a17-pro-chip-and-more.2404576/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9d41fda02d292993f9cd67dd2f3690f9a4fef646574cd4286b347366e057691a","category":"Apple"}
