Now we have the first full-size 3D digital scan of the complete wreckage—a \"digital twin\" that captures <em>Titanic</em> in unprecedented detail. Magellan Ltd, a <a href=\"https://www.magellan.gg/titanic-in-3d/\">deep-sea mapping company</a>, and Atlantic Productions (which is making a documentary about the project) conducted the scans over a six-week expedition last summer.</p>\n<p>“Great explorers have been down to the <em>Titanic</em>... but actually they went with really low-resolution cameras and they could only speculate on what happened,\" Atlantic Productions CEO Andrew Geffen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2XtefrMNhg\">told BBC News</a>. “We now have every rivet of the <em>Titanic</em>, every detail, we can put it back together, so for the first time we can actually see what happened and use real science to find out what happened.\" </p>\n<p><em>Titanic</em> met its doom just four days into the Atlantic crossing, roughly 375 miles (600 kilometers) south of Newfoundland. At 11:40 pm ship's time on April 14, 1912, <em>Titanic</em> hit that infamous iceberg and began taking on water, flooding five of its 16 watertight compartments, thereby sealing its fate. More than 1,500 passengers and crew perished; only around 710 of those on board survived.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939778#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939778&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8c6eb4322d0c321e7ce2f1cb7538233062cb584766dfd0c0dff3023d24ad6ee6","category":"Tech"}
