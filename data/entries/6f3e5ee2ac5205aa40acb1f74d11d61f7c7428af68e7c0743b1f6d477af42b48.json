This way, if you have put AirTags inside your bags, the airline can better help you find them in the event they are lost or delayed at the airport.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAmerican Airlines rolled out support for the feature this week, a spokesperson for the airline confirmed. Other airlines that already offered the feature include <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/16/united-delta-air-canada-find-my-luggage/\">Delta, United, Air Canada</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/06/airtag-lost-baggage-feature-more-airlines/\">Virgin Atlantic, Lufthansa</a>, and more. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is what an American Airlines spokesperson told <em>View from the Wing</em>:<blockquote>We've introduced the ability for customers to easily and securely share the location of their AirTag or Find My network accessory directly with the airline.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCustomers can generate a link through Apple's Share Item feature available on iOS 18.2 or later and share it with American in the rare case when a bag is delayed for any trips with a segment from or to a U.S. airport. Customers just need to scan the QR code at the baggage office to start their claim and provide their information.</blockquote><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iOS-18-2-Share-Item-Location.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\niPhone, iPad, and Mac users running iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2 or later can generate a \"Share Item Location\" link in the Find My app. Anyone they share the link with can then view a web page with a location of the item on a map. The page will automatically update with the item's latest known location. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple said it worked directly with airlines to put systems in place to \"privately and securely\" accept the \"Share Item Location\" links. Access to each link is \"limited to a small number of people,\" and airport employees are required to \"authenticate\" to view the link by signing into their Apple Account or partner email address.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Apple-Share-Item-Location-iPhone-iPad-Mac.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nThe item's location stops being shared \"as soon as a user is reunited with their item,\" or automatically expires after seven days.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 18.2 was released in December, and Apple said that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/apple-announces-airtag-location-sharing/\">additional airlines</a> will implement this feature over the coming months.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/american-airlines-airtag-baggage-feature/\">iPhone Feature for Tracking Lost Baggage Expands to American Airlines</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-feature-for-tracking-lost-baggage-expands-to-american-airlines.2449806/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6f3e5ee2ac5205aa40acb1f74d11d61f7c7428af68e7c0743b1f6d477af42b48","category":"Apple"}
