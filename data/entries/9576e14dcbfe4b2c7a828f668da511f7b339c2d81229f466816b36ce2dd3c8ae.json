Working with him on the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/meriwether-ponderosa-gravel-bike-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Ponderosa project last year</a> was just what I needed to fuel my stoke for drop bar bikes. Getting to know the brain behind Meriwether Cycles felt like it came at a serendipitous time. I think what motivates Whit to build custom frames is why I love custom frames and I really admire where his head is at.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylan_Meriwether_Midtail_Fat_Bike.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylan_Meriwether_Midtail_Fat_Bike.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylan_Meriwether_Midtail_Fat_Bike.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylan_Meriwether_Midtail_Fat_Bike.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>When he told me about Dylan’s midtail touring fat bike project, my mind was blown. Then, meeting Dylan in person last week at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sincerecycles/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Sincere Cycles</a> – while he was in town visiting his dad who lives here in Santa Fe, and to pick up the bike – I could feel how unique of a project that was.</p>\n<p>The way Dylan described the whole process with Whit, from picking up the midtail in person when already roadtripping nearby to save shipping charges, and later flying with it to Australia for lengthy desert tours, I knew I was talking to a true desert rat.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Thorny_Devil_Australia_Peter_Walton.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Thorny_Devil_Australia_Peter_Walton.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Thorny_Devil_Australia_Peter_Walton.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Thorny_Devil_Australia_Peter_Walton.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Photograph: Peter Walton Photography/Getty Images</em></p>\n<p><em>As an aside: Dylan has seen countless Thorny Devils, also known as Molochs, one of my all-time favorite desert reptiles. They drink water via capillary action by standing in puddles of water. These lizards have evolved to mimic the thorny desert plants of the region, many of which have been eradicated by invasive species, but in their own existence, they remain a true rose of the Australian desert. Look at that lil bugger!</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Meriwether-Cycles-Shop-Visit-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Meriwether-Cycles-Shop-Visit-14.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Meriwether-Cycles-Shop-Visit-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Meriwether-Cycles-Shop-Visit-14.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>The Meriwether Fat Bike Process</h3>\n<p>While the white midtail is Dylan’s proper expedition bike, he wanted something less cumbersome for two- or three-day camping trips. Knowing Whit was capable of meeting his design expectations. Dylan requested a titanium fat bike frame with a steel fork and a Rohloff Speedhub.</p>\n<p>Whit got to drawing, noting to me that:</p>\n<p>“It’s the exact same geometry and front triangle size as [Dylan’s] white steel frame, so he could use the same framebag. He loved the fit of that first bike, so now he has a steel and Ti version, except one is the heavier steel midtail with the crazy racks. Instead, he chose <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=9810ede6-4922-46d9-b096-e2993c490cc6&amp;website_id=6ec3743b-a948-4c16-9d12-4b79ac107f25&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Foldmanmountain.com%2Fproduct%2Fdivide-fat-bike-rack%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOorsSFuGiGQ7CPYJCvqMzCvK8jsUNO__lRn2w6DHTFl0np5nRypy\" target=\"_blank\">Old Man Mountain Divide Fat racks</a> for this bike.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-20.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-20.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-20.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-20.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-46.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-46.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-46.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-46.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-17.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-17.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-17.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-17.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>As for the fork, which features a Charlie Cunningham-inspired Type II crown, Whit said:</p>\n<p>“Those lower blades are butted Columbus to save weight and add flex but it’s still almost heavier than the frame (the bent and scalloped crown tubing is super thick wall to provide the right sleeve ID for the lower blades and there’s just a lot of material to make it strong enough for loaded touring). The caliper gusset was to protect that thinner wall section.”</p>\n<p>When it comes to making a drivetrain work on a fat bike, it’s a multi-stage process. First, Whit had to address the fat bike tire clearance. Those Terrene Johnny 5 tires mounted to Lithic rims measure out to just over 5″. The chainstay yoke had to clear not only the tire tread but the plump sidewalls. He pinged Daniel from Neuhaus to facilitate, and the resulting yokes are 6″ long to ensure proper fit.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-29.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-29.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-29.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-29.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Whit added:</p>\n<p>“The chainstay yokes look that way since it’s basically a singlespeed fatbike – the long &amp; wide sidewall of the tire casing needs to be able to travel back up to 20 mm in the sliding dropouts while maintaining sufficient tire clearance. Squeeze the yoke between the crankarm and 34t chainring. This is what Daniel created, and it fit up perfectly. The Otso Arctodos uses a long machined plate to achieve this same effect, but with less tire clearance and heavier weight.”</p>\n<p>Then, along with the yokes, the bottom bracket and chainline always need a tender touch. Whit continued, “The crank is the oddball, but he wanted the 160 arms, and Ignite went out of business, so I sold him my personal used pair. I minimized the Q using a Race Face spindle and got the right Rohloff chainline. It was a head-scratcher, but Daniel made the yokes fit perfectly.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-38.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-38.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-38.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-38.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Setting it Up</h3>\n<p>I was sitting at Sincere Cycles as Bailey checked the “proper way to have the Rohloff grip shift installed for the internet experts” – a joke he and I always have when setting up a bike for photos. He and I want shit to be dialed so the conversion steers towards the discussion of the bike’s intent (which is hopefully matched by its impact), not the setup (which can be changed).</p>\n<p>We were dialing the bike in as Bailey grabbed the floppy cables and noted, “The cables look all crazy because Dylan wanted them to be long enough to not interfere with his handlebar bag, so we mocked it up with a Revelate Pronghorn bag I had in stock to ensure everything cleared okay.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-32.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-32.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-32.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-32.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Seeing the full Ergon grips, in lieu of the grip shift, shorter grips available on the market, I thought to myself, “Niiiice,” knowing what Dylan was going for. A late afternoon text from Bailey confirmed my thought: “He wants ultimate control, so he went with full-length grips.”</p>\n<p>In my mind, I was thinking in a tourer, you really don’t shift all that much. So the need to have the grip shift closer to your operational hand (or even under it) wasn’t a huge necessity. Even in the half mile pedal to my photo spot, I noticed this and it felt like a genius move only someone who takes on proper expedition riding would make.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-40.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-40.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-40.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-40.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Sort of like the lack of water bottle bosses in the front triangle. Why bother if you’re just going to fill it with a framebag? Dylan kept the cargo bosses under the downtube, but Whit upgraded them to M6 instead of M5. They’re extra beefy for carrying a jug of water there. He’s also got plenty of bosses on the fork. When I asked him why he opted for no portage handle, a Meriwether signature detail, he commented, “I didn’t need one. I told him to take it off the drawing first thing.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-42.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-42.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-42.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-42.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Why Rohloff?</h3>\n<p>On the subject of the Rohloff…</p>\n<p>Fifteen years ago, Dylan rode from Seattle to Ushuaia on a singlespeed. He loved its simplicity and ease of maintenance, but there were two or three times when he wanted to go somewhere but realistically couldn’t; he would not have been able to ride the single gear with all the food and water needed to get to where he wanted to go.</p>\n<p>Upon returning from that trip, he got a Rohloff and cycled a loop at the edges of the continental US along with a prologue south down the Alcan highway. Simplicity, ease of maintenance, and now with gears. Sometimes ya gotta carry 32 liters of water in the Outback, and low Rohloff spinny gears will help him do that.</p>\n<p>How do you know someone has a Rohloff? Don’t worry, they’ll tell you. Dylan now has three….</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-56.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-56.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-56.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-56.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Ecosystem</h3>\n<p>As this year gains momentum, <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/the-bike-industry-is-broken/\" target=\"_blank\">my mind has been in a spot of reflection</a>, both over the past four years and where I want this website to go in the future. These past and future planning sessions are entirely mental, until I put pen to paper, but one thing I’ve noticed and feel the need to address is how customers will take up hours of a shop’s time, squeezing them for knowledge, only to buy online, rather than order through the very shops that helped them out. Something’s gotta give.</p>\n<p>Dylan gets it. He worked with Whit on the frame, ordered a few choice parts through him, and then had Bailey at Sincere buy the rest. Bailey got to build the wheels (which he was so stoked to do) and set the entire bike up.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-22.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-22.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-22.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-22.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Rohloff has specific specs for spokes. They want them to fall within to avoid hub flange breakage. During the wheel-building process, Bailey contacted Dylan to suggest a spoke that fell within these specs. Dylan replied to Bailey:</p>\n<p>“I came to you to build those wheels because you are the expert.”</p>\n<p>As Bailey was telling me this, my admiration for Dylan grew. I love cyclotourists. They’re the next step in human evolution. In many ways, they’ve removed the technological dopamine that’s undoubtedly pushing our brain’s evolution (in the wrong way I might add) and replace it with an intrinsic link to nature.</p>\n<p>This whole industry is an ecosystem and no cyclist understands that better than the cyclotourist. Connecting with natural systems influences how they interact with the modern world. Even those as harsh as dry and arid places. Now, I might be making a giant leap here – apologies if you’re reading this and laughing at my absurdity, Dylan, but in order for bike companies (even small ones like Meriwether) and shops to survive, there needs to be a symbiotic relationship.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-55.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-55.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-55.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-55.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Cyclical Relationships</h3>\n<p>What was perhaps the thing that brought me the most joy here was meeting Dylan through an email last year and then in person last week. Without getting too personal, I found a connection with him. If only through our shared love of desert touring, that I tried to distill down and pour onto the documentation of his new bike.</p>\n<p>Every human that touched this INSANE beaut of a tourer has moved me in their own special way. And I am elated to be a part of this bike’s story. I only wish I could have gotten in a ride with Dylan, or at least gotten a portrait with him. Unfortunately, before the bike was completed, he had to leave town.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, there’s a touring story on the way from this legend in the future. Safe travels, mate.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-54.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-54.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-54.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Dylans-Meriwether-Ti-Touring-Fat-Bike-54.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Dylan’s Meriwether Fat Bike Build Spec:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Frame: Meriwether Ti Touring Fat Bike</li>\n<li>Fork: Meriwether Unicrown</li>\n<li>Headset: Cane Creek <a href=\"https://www.canecreek.com/products/viscoset?srsltid=AfmBOopSmccHJUK1xtjF1k25wi2JDo480mIhu-BvguXmWlvQWNl582Y9\" target=\"_blank\">Viscoset</a></li>\n<li>Stem: <a href=\"https://www.paulcomp.com/shop/components/boxcars/boxcar-stem/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Boxcar</a> with <a href=\"https://meriwethercycles.com/bars-shims/\" target=\"_blank\">Meriwether Shimzilla</a></li>\n<li>Bars: Meriwether</li>\n<li>Grips: Ergon GP2</li>\n<li>Shifters: Rohloff</li>\n<li>Brake levers: <a href=\"https://www.paulcomp.com/product-category/components/brake-levers/short-pull/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Short Pull</a></li>\n<li>Brake Calipers: <a href=\"https://www.paulcomp.com/shop/components/brakes/disc-brakes/i-s-klamper/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Klamper</a></li>\n<li>Front Wheel: DT Swiss fat hub to <a href=\"https://otsocycles.com/products/lithic-cryolite-26-aluminum-fat-rim-100mm?srsltid=AfmBOooaY8FTrS5MncX5uq-7xcnDlqXLbnsyZbhItTcZO6qhkCyszgu_\" target=\"_blank\">Lithic Fat Rims</a></li>\n<li>Rear Wheel: Rohloff fat hub to Lithic Fat Rims</li>\n<li>Tires: <a href=\"https://www.terrenetires.com/collections/johnny-5?srsltid=AfmBOoqLmePvgfKRBBTJJ0xdJouOwK8aRToN_J_k1qtmDgIse9xHlJ3c\" target=\"_blank\">Terrene Johnny 5</a></li>\n<li>Front Rack: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=9810ede6-4922-46d9-b096-e2993c490cc6&amp;website_id=6ec3743b-a948-4c16-9d12-4b79ac107f25&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Foldmanmountain.com%2Fproduct%2Fdivide-fat-bike-rack%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOorsSFuGiGQ7CPYJCvqMzCvK8jsUNO__lRn2w6DHTFl0np5nRypy\" target=\"_blank\">Old Man Mountain Divide Fat</a></li>\n<li>Rear Rack: Old Man Mountain Divide Fat</li>\n<li>Cranks: Ignite 160mm</li>\n<li>Chainring: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=1f8f513b-b98b-4cf0-abf5-e477c8747e9c&amp;website_id=6ec3743b-a948-4c16-9d12-4b79ac107f25&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wolftoothcomponents.com%2Fproducts%2Fdirect-mount-chainrings-for-sram-cranks%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoofaDgzn7KULGk3aWiGVUASOYoG3hro7JE0LU8ummGjpEp1RYNV\" target=\"_blank\">Wolf Tooth</a></li>\n<li>Bottom Bracket: Race Face</li>\n<li>Seatpost: <a href=\"https://www.agavefinishworks.com/shop\" target=\"_blank\">Juniper Components</a></li>\n<li>Saddle: Fizik</li>\n<li>Bags: <a href=\"https://www.jpaks.com/shop-1/footlong-ext-snakpak\" target=\"_blank\">JPaks Ext Snakpak</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/meriwether-ti-touring-fat-bike/\">Dylan’s Meriwether Ti Touring Fat Bike: Destined for Deserts</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"9576e14dcbfe4b2c7a828f668da511f7b339c2d81229f466816b36ce2dd3c8ae","category":"Cycling"}
