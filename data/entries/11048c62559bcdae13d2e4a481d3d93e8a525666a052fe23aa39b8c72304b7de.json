The key was that they wanted a fork to make gravel bikes go faster, smoother over any terrain. That meant it needed to filter out fast vibrations on high-speed descents, but not to eat up big drops or take the chunk out of steep techy turns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This focus on gravel speed brought topics like aerodynamics, rolling resistance, weight, and compliance into consideration. But Canyon pretty much came to the conclusion that no existing gravel forks really delivered a performance gain that outweighed their downsides. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, when Canyon reached out to DT Swiss with the idea to create a more integrated gravel suspension fork solution, the wheel and suspension specialists were up to the challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what’s new?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A new, more integrated look</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-40mm-travel-gravel-suspension-fork.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-40mm-travel-gravel-suspension-fork.webp\" alt=\"DT Swiss F 132 One 40mm travel gravel suspension fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-40mm-travel-gravel-suspension-fork.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-40mm-travel-gravel-suspension-fork-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-40mm-travel-gravel-suspension-fork-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-40mm-travel-gravel-suspension-fork-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-40mm-travel-gravel-suspension-fork-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Studio photos/DT Swiss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the outside, we see a more sleek aesthetic solution than most suspension forks – knobs, dials, and even most cables tucked out the way. The reverse arch design even hides the suspension just a bit more when seen from the front or an angle. Canyon says they didn’t want to scare away traditional roadies. This was clearly meant to make the bike faster, especially for longer distances where fatigue starts to set it. So, in fact, the roadie who is reluctant to buy a gravel bike with a visible suspension fork, might actually be the best candidate to buy a new bike with this DT F 132 One gravel fork. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unreleased-Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-F132-One-gravel-bike-suspension-fork_reverse-arch-detail.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unreleased-Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-F132-One-gravel-bike-suspension-fork_reverse-arch-detail.webp\" alt=\"Canyon DT Swiss F132 One 40mm travel gravel suspension fork sneak peek, reverse arch detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unreleased-Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-F132-One-gravel-bike-suspension-fork_reverse-arch-detail.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unreleased-Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-F132-One-gravel-bike-suspension-fork_reverse-arch-detail-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unreleased-Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-F132-One-gravel-bike-suspension-fork_reverse-arch-detail-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unreleased-Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-F132-One-gravel-bike-suspension-fork_reverse-arch-detail-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unreleased-Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-F132-One-gravel-bike-suspension-fork_reverse-arch-detail-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unreleased-Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-F132-One-gravel-bike-suspension-fork_reverse-arch-detail-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unreleased-Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-F132-One-gravel-bike-suspension-fork_reverse-arch-detail-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon and DT designers worked closely to create a more integrated look. Part of that is tidy brake line and remote dropper integration. Part is the sloping crown with covers to hid the adjustments like DT already did with their original <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/dt-swiss-introduces-position-sensitive-damping-on-new-535-one-trail-fork/\">535 One</a> all-mountain fork.  Interestingly, even though it’s only available on a Grail for now, Canyons says, its “<em>fork geometry, offset and trail was also refined to work best with the Grail and the Grizl</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>PushControl: An Easy Lockout from any position in the drop bar</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_remote-lockout-lever.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_remote-lockout-lever.webp\" alt=\"DT Swiss F 132 One for exclusively for Canyon gravel bikes, remote lockout lever\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_remote-lockout-lever.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_remote-lockout-lever-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_remote-lockout-lever-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_remote-lockout-lever-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_remote-lockout-lever-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most important requirements was a complete lockout, but one that was easy to use. The DT Swiss PushControl solution uses a continuously rotating ratchet inside the top of the left fork leg. Each push of the remote locks or unlocks the fork – closing off the flow of oil through the hydraulic damping circuit. Press once to lock, a second time to unlock, a third to lock again, etc, etc. It works simply with the DT remote lever to press down in the back from the drops of lift up from the front on the tops. But since there isn’t a specific cable travel needed to latch or engage a lockout, I think in theory other actuators could work too, like a Shimano mechanical left lever dropper remote, or even a SRAM left mechanical shifter with the guts removed. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>LineAir SL air spring and PlainGain damping</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_DT-rollover-test.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_DT-rollover-test.webp\" alt=\"DT Swiss F 132 One for exclusively for Canyon gravel bikes, less vibration is faster\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_DT-rollover-test.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_DT-rollover-test-297x165.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_DT-rollover-test-1536x853.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_DT-rollover-test-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_DT-rollover-test-768x427.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>DT Swiss explained that the air spring with self-balancing positive &amp; negative chambers was key to overcoming any stiction<em> in the seals to deliver “small bump sensitivity, minimising rough stuff fatigue, gluing your tire to the ground through loose corners”. It was this refined plushness that was</em> key to a gravel suspension fork, since the cumulative fatigue from repeated small bumps was much more detrimental to gravel riders than some less frequent, big hit like you see mountain biking. You adjust your air pressure by simply accessing the standard Shrader valve under the right-side crown cap.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_x-ray-inside.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_x-ray-inside.webp\" alt=\"DT Swiss F 132 One for exclusively for Canyon gravel bikes_, x-ray\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_x-ray-inside.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_x-ray-inside-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_x-ray-inside-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_x-ray-inside-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_x-ray-inside-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_x-ray-inside-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_x-ray-inside-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The other key suspension tech inside was a proper lightweight hydraulic damper. DT calls it position-sensitive damping, that balances the relatively short 40mm of travel to increase compression damping as you move through the travel for something similar to a bottomless feel – but with much less travel. “<em>Providing genuine control on rocky sections and braking bumps, not just random undamped bounce. This crucial rebound damping can be matched to rider weight and performance preference through 9 clicks of the easily accessible lower leg dial.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tech details</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_internal-routing.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_internal-routing.webp\" alt=\"DT Swiss F 132 One for exclusively for Canyon gravel bikes, internal routing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_internal-routing.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_internal-routing-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_internal-routing-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_internal-routing-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_internal-routing-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_internal-routing-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DT-Swiss-F-132-One-for-exclusively-for-Canyon-gravel-bikes_internal-routing-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>40mm of gravel-specific travel, not a reduced travel mountain bike fork</li>\n\n\n\n<li>self-balancing LineAir positive &amp;

Therefore, the fork will not be available on the aftermarket, but exclusively through selected OEM partners, starting in 2025 with Canyon.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://DTSwiss.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>DTSwiss.com</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/canyon-grail-rift-edition-launches-40mm-dt-swiss-f-132-one-gravel-suspension-fork/\">Canyon Grail Rift Edition Launches 40mm DT Swiss F 132 One Gravel Suspension Fork</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"11048c62559bcdae13d2e4a481d3d93e8a525666a052fe23aa39b8c72304b7de","category":"Cycling"}
