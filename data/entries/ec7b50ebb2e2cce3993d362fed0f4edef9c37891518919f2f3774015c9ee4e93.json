The agency's advisory group on immunizations determined that, as of now, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/healthy-adults-dont-need-annual-covid-boosters-who-advisors-say/\">healthy adults and children do not need additional boosters</a> in the near term, but certain high-risk groups should be offered boosters every six to 12 months.</p>\n<p>The US's spring boosters will be offered to high-risk people who have gone at least four months since their last shot and want additional protection, the Post reported. The US last authorized a booster dose in September, meaning that some in the high-risk group may be around seven months past their last dose.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928954#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928954&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ec7b50ebb2e2cce3993d362fed0f4edef9c37891518919f2f3774015c9ee4e93","category":"Tech"}
