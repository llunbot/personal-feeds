Taking care of a plant might seem easy when you first take one home. Pop the pot in the sun, add water, and watch it grow. Right? The brown tips and wilting leaves seem to say differently. All plants have different needs, and they can even get sick. It’s a lot to keep track of, but there’s an app that can make it a lot easier. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plantum takes the guesswork out of gardening. This<a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/natureid-plan-identification-premium-plan-lifetime-subscription?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=natureid-plan-identification-premium-plan-lifetime-subscription&amp;utm_term=scsf-610042&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002gShxIAE&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"> iOS-compatible app</a> can identify over 33,000 plant species from only a picture, but that’s not all. From that picture, it can also help you keep that plant healthy, and a lifetime subscription is on sale for $14.97 (Reg. $59). </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>An app can make you a master gardener</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wilting leaves? Discolored stem? <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/natureid-plan-identification-premium-plan-lifetime-subscription?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=natureid-plan-identification-premium-plan-lifetime-subscription&amp;utm_term=scsf-610042&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002gShxIAE&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">Plantum</a> can identify any issues with your plant and provide solutions to get it back on track. Sometimes, that means putting it in better light, changing how much or how often you water, or rotating it more often.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plantum also helps with upkeep. You can upload your whole garden and set watering and turning reminders. If you have a lot of different plants with different needs, that can be a big help. You don’t want to leaf them hanging. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time to get to the root of your plant’s problem. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>January 12 at 11:59 p.m. PT is the deadline to get a <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/natureid-plan-identification-premium-plan-lifetime-subscription?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=natureid-plan-identification-premium-plan-lifetime-subscription&amp;utm_term=scsf-610042&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002gShxIAE&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">lifetime subscription to Plantum</a> for $14.97. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/natureid-plan-identification-premium-plan-lifetime-subscription?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=natureid-plan-identification-premium-plan-lifetime-subscription&amp;utm_term=scsf-610042&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002gShxIAE&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp2.stackassets.com/fa37b9b25afbf49af1b28c6ca3c73b79ec156b40/store/bc13a8100c4ec746d6bda86c4e9bfb5350779ee417549a155f21b85e7ec7/sale_311532_primary_image.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Plantum – AI Plant Identifier Premium Plan: Lifetime Subscription (For iOS Only) – $14.97</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/natureid-plan-identification-premium-plan-lifetime-subscription?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=natureid-plan-identification-premium-plan-lifetime-subscription&amp;utm_term=scsf-610042&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002gShxIAE&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com/\"><em>StackSocial</em></a><em> prices subject to change.</em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"89ad9c6a11b1fa1d3198c175a0fde343da51765531e10ccbede568398597077a","category":"Apple"}
