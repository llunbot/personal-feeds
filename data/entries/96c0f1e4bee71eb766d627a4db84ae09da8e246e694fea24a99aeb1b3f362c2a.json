LG Display declined to comment; however, the report cites a source stating that the increased capacity will almost be entirely used for OLED displays meant for Apple devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple currently uses OLED displays in its higher-end iPhones and has done so since the introduction of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> X in 2017. Lower-end models of the ‌iPhone‌, such as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-xr/\">iPhone XR</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a> 2, continue to use LCD technology thanks to their lower costs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUntil April, Apple only utilized OLED and LCD technology, but with the introduction of the new 12.9-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, Apple has also introduced mini-LED into the family. With the upcoming redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros, Apple will also expand mini-LED to the Mac.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDespite mini-LEDs recent introduction into Apple devices, the company is planning to bring OLED to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/31/ipad-models-with-oled-next-year/\">some iPad models</a> for the first time. While one report suggests that the fifth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>, rumored for launch next year, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/30/ipad-air-oled-display-next-year/\">will include an OLED display</a>, that report has been discredited by more reliable sources stating the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/07/first-oled-ipad-coming-in-2023/\">first iPad with an OLED display will arrive in 2023</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/\">OLED</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lg-display/\">LG Display</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/18/lg-oled-capacity-apple-more-devices/\">LG Doubles OLED Production Capacity As Apple Expected to Transition More Devices to the Display Tech</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lg-doubles-oled-production-capacity-as-apple-expected-to-transition-more-devices-to-the-display-tech.2307895/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=toPSYlA7auY:ZT1TZLsZOWs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=toPSYlA7auY:ZT1TZLsZOWs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/toPSYlA7auY\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"96c0f1e4bee71eb766d627a4db84ae09da8e246e694fea24a99aeb1b3f362c2a","category":"Apple"}
