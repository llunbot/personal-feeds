On paper, the new EC90 ALX carbon wheels look killer. They’re 58% deeper for improved aerodynamics vs. Easton’s popular EC90 AX wheels, get a spoke upgrade, and a 10% lower price – all that with just twenty-two grams of extra mass to spin up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Easton EC90 ALX mid-depth aero carbon gravel wheels </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_Sapim-CX-Ray-spokes.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_Sapim-CX-Ray-spokes.jpg\" alt=\"Easton EC90 ALX mid-depth aero carbon gravel wheelset, Sapim CX-Ray spokes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_Sapim-CX-Ray-spokes.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_Sapim-CX-Ray-spokes-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_Sapim-CX-Ray-spokes-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_Sapim-CX-Ray-spokes-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_Sapim-CX-Ray-spokes-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_Sapim-CX-Ray-spokes-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Easton)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year Easton added a new ALX all-road &amp; gravel racing line-up to their long-running AX adventure gravel family. It kicked off with just one slightly-flared carbon <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/easton-ec90-alx-blends-road-gravel-ergonomics-into-ultralight-handlebar/\" target=\"_blank\">EC90 ALX handlebar</a>. But now it looks like Easton is going deeper into going fast across all surfaces, with a set of ALX race wheels, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Go further, faster. Gravel has gotten faster and aerodynamics are of growing importance to riders battling headwinds, washboards, and 10+ hours in the saddle without the support of a team or peloton.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_rim-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_rim-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Easton EC90 ALX mid-depth aero carbon gravel wheelset, rim detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_rim-detail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_rim-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_rim-detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_rim-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_rim-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_rim-detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_rim-detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the EC90 <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/easton-gravel-wheels-roll-on-with-wide-carbon-ec90-ax-ec70-ax-wheelsets/\" target=\"_blank\">AX gravel wheels</a> that we rode, abused, and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/easton-gravel-wheels-roll-on-with-wide-carbon-ec90-ax-ec70-ax-wheelsets/\" target=\"_blank\">kept riding</a>, the new EC90 ALX is just meant to go faster. The carbon rims are the same 24mm internal hookless tubeless, but now grow to 36mm deep for extra aero speed without getting heavy. In fact, I was pretty impressed to read that these wheels have the same <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/easton-vault-spins-out-oversized-road-disc-brake-hub-in-new-ea90-sl-disc-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">Vault hubs</a>, the same rim width, an upgrade to premium Sapim CX-Ray bladed spokes, and evolve from 21mm (<em>AX</em>) to 36mm (<em>ALX</em>) deep now… but the claimed new aero gravel wheelset is only 22g heavier!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheelset_angled-rear-wheel.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheelset_angled-rear-wheel.jpg\" alt=\"Easton EC90 ALX mid-depth aero carbon gravel wheelset, angled rear wheel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheelset_angled-rear-wheel.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheelset_angled-rear-wheel-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheelset_angled-rear-wheel-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheelset_angled-rear-wheel-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheelset_angled-rear-wheel-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This mid-depth obviously didn’t add much weight, but Easton also claims it really improves aerodynamics with 35-45mm gravel tires. Although, they haven’t shared any concrete drag figures – either from CFD or wind tunnel testing. But again, the new rim is still shallow enough not to be overly stiff, rattling you down washboard roads. Or to feel like a sail that you’ll be fighting in crosswinds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_Vault-CL-hubs.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_Vault-CL-hubs.jpg\" alt=\"Easton EC90 ALX mid-depth aero carbon gravel wheelset, Vault CL hubs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_Vault-CL-hubs.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_Vault-CL-hubs-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_Vault-CL-hubs-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_Vault-CL-hubs-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_Vault-CL-hubs-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Rim</em>: carbon 24mm hookless tubeless </li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Rim aero dimensions</em>: 36mm deep x 30mm wide outside</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Tires</em>: optimized for 35-50mm tubeless gravel tires, compatible with 30-53mm tubeless tires</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Hubs</em>: Easton/RaceFace Vault CL 3-pawl hubs with 60T, 6° engagement</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Freehubs</em>: tool-free Shimano HG11, MicroSpline, or SRAM XDR</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Disc brake</em>: Centerlock, max 180mm rotor</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Spokes</em>: 24x straight-pull Sapim CX-Ray bladed double-butted</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Nipples</em>: Sapim Secure Lock external alloy </li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Wheelset weight</em>: 1492g (<em>claimed</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Easton EC90 ALX wheelset – Pricing</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_wheelset.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_wheelset.jpg\" alt=\"Easton EC90 ALX mid-depth aero carbon gravel wheelset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_wheelset.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_wheelset-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_wheelset-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_wheelset-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easton-EC90-ALX-mid-depth-aero-carbon-gravel-wheels_wheelset-768x480.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Easton aero carbon all-road and gravel EC90 ALX wheels sell for $1398, available direct from Easton or your local bikeshop.
