And its conclusion, which will not make happy reading for Apple, is that the numbers are going up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The study asked US consumers how old their previous Mac had been when they chose to replace it. In 2024, more than half (56 percent) said 3 years or more. That’s a 16-point increase from the equivalent survey in 2020, when just 40 percent gave that answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the “3 years or more” category increased in size, all the other categories shrank. The number of upgraders who keep their Mac for 2-3 years has dropped from 19 to 13 percent; those who keep it for 1-2 years have dropped from 23 to 19 percent; and the lucky group who are able to replace their Mac annually has dropped from 19 to 13 percent.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CIRP.png\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CIRP.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1127w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CIRP.png?resize=300%2C220&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CIRP.png?resize=768%2C564&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"751\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption>Image: CIRP</figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CIRP.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1127w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CIRP.png?resize=300%2C220&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CIRP.png?resize=768%2C564&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"751\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>Image: CIRP</figcaption></figure></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CIRP.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1127w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CIRP.png?resize=300%2C220&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CIRP.png?resize=768%2C564&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"751\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>Image: CIRP</figcaption></figure></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason consumers are keeping their Macs longer, according to CIRP, is that users are moving more towards streaming and web-based apps, which means there is less need to bump up processing power and therefore less motivation to upgrade frequently. CIRP also highlights a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-30/apple-s-longer-lasting-devices-ios-19-and-apple-intelligence-on-the-vision-pro-ly1jnrw4\" target=\"_blank\">report by Mark Gurman</a> that cites fewer cutting-edge features as well as increased reliability and durability as reasons for the increasing lifecycle of Apple devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In recent years,” Gurman writes, “Apple’s pace of hardware innovation has slowed… The current MacBook Pro has the same basic form factor as it did in 2021, and I wouldn’t expect a new look until 2025 or 2026. The MacBook Air was redesigned in 2022, and a future change is probably years away as well. The end result: Getting average consumers to regularly upgrade to a new model is harder than it used to be.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A modern Mac computer with an Apple M-series chip is strong enough for most Mac users to hold on to it for 3 years or more. Even the first machine with Apple’s M1 chip, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234819/macbook-air-m1-review-an-absolutely-stunning-debut-for-apple-silicon-in-a-mac.html\">MacBook Air from 2020</a>, still has enough bounce in its step for everyday use such as sending emails, browsing, simple photo and video editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some ways, then, the report reflects well on Apple’s Mac range; but that will be scant consolation if revenues dry up from a lack of upgrade activity. Let’s hope Cupertino has something exciting in store for the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2204696/m3-mac-studio-design-processor-specs-price.html\">M3 Mac Studio</a>.</p>\n\nMac</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"099533ce5d0459fa6d1f22c4a2b23c7948724127461edffab930f23916e04792","category":"Apple"}
