Claude 3 Haiku, the fastest and most compact model in the family, is now available in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock</a>. Check out <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/anthropics-claude-3-haiku-model-is-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock/\">Channy’s post</a> for more details. In addition, my colleague <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikegchambers/\">Mike</a> shows <a href=\"https://community.aws/content/2dfToY7frDS4y8LsTkntgBzORju/hands-on\">how to get started with Haiku in Amazon Bedrock in his video on community.aws</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Up to 40 percent faster stack creation with AWS CloudFormation</strong> — <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/\">AWS CloudFormation</a> now creates stacks up to 40 percent faster and has a new event called <code>CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE</code>. With this event, CloudFormation begins parallel creation of dependent resources within a stack, speeding up the whole process. The new event also gives users more control to shortcut their stack creation process in scenarios where a resource consistency check is unnecessary. To learn more, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/how-we-sped-up-aws-cloudformation-deployments-with-optimistic-stabilization/\">read this AWS DevOps Blog post</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon SageMaker Canvas extends its model registry integration</strong> — <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/canvas/\">SageMaker Canvas</a> has extended its model registry integration to include time series forecasting models and models fine-tuned through <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/jumpstart/\">SageMaker JumpStart</a>. Users can now register these models to the SageMaker Model Registry with just a click. This enhancement expands the model registry integration to all problem types supported in Canvas, such as regression/classification tabular models and CV/NLP models. It streamlines the deployment of machine learning (ML) models to production environments. <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/canvas-register-model.html\">Check the Developer Guide for more information.</a></p> \n<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What's New at AWS page.</a> \n<p><strong><u>Other AWS news<br /> </u></strong>Here are some additional news items, open source projects, and Twitch shows that you might find interesting:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/03/15/buildon.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/03/15/buildon.png\" alt=\"AWS Build On Generative AI\" width=\"200\" height=\"112\" /></a><strong>Build On Generative AI</strong> — Season 3 of your favorite <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/aws/schedule?vodID=2087790091\">weekly Twitch show</a> about all things generative AI is in full swing!
