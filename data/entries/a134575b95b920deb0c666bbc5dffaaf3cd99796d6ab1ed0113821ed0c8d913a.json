There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope.

Its name, Jones 1, is notable because relatively few astronomical objects are named after women, and this is one of the first. Jones made her career as an assistant to other more \"notable\" astronomers of the day, including Harlow Shapley and Wallace Eckert.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990211#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990211&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a134575b95b920deb0c666bbc5dffaaf3cd99796d6ab1ed0113821ed0c8d913a","category":"Tech"}
