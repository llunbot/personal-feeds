The new Laptop Studio 2 will start at <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/2p9d5yny\" target=\"_blank\">$1,999.99</a> and is available for preorder now; it will ship on October 3.</p>\n    <div>\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                                                <h3>Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio 2                                                </h3>\n                        <div>\n                                                            <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/2p9d5yny\" target=\"_blank\">\n                                    From $2000 at Microsoft                                </a>\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                                <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/2p9d5yny\" target=\"_blank\"></a>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <div>(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<p>The Laptop Studio 2 is a substantial internal overhaul, swapping out a quad-core 11th-generation Intel Core CPU and a GeForce 3050 Ti for a 13th-generation CPU and GeForce RTX 4050 and 4060 options (with an RTX 2000 also available for people who need a \"pro\" GPU). Microsoft continues to refresh Surface devices toward the end of Intel's product cycles, and next-generation <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/intels-meteor-lake-cpus-bring-a-much-faster-gpu-radically-new-chip-design/\">Meteor Lake Core processors</a> should be coming soon, but this is still a welcome upgrade over the old model. It's also the first x86 Surface that Microsoft sells with an NPU for accelerating AI and machine learning workloads, specifically an <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/230545/gen-3-intel-movidius-3700vc-vpu/specifications.html\">Intel Gen 3 Intel Movidius 3700VC</a>.</p>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/surface-laptop-studio-2-image-1_print-980x551.jpeg\" alt /></div>\n          <p>\n            New ports and updated internals are nice, but the price tag is tough to swallow.

It includes an i7-13700H with six P-cores, eight E-cores, and 16GB of RAM, but it only comes with integrated graphics and a 512GB SSD.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969995#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969995&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ebb498509818a6acb902a8585cff90ae1119f6e04e713c6b67b81d81279579aa","category":"Tech"}
