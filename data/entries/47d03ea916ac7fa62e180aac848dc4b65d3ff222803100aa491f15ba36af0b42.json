Let's hope not, but the quarrel between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk may be remembered as \"Black Thursday\" for the US space program. A simmering disagreement over Trump's signature \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" coursing its way through Congress erupted into public view, with two of the most powerful Americans trading insults and threats on social media. Trump suggested the government should terminate \"Elon's governmental contracts and subsidies.\" Musk responded with a post saying SpaceX will begin decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft used to transport crew and cargo to the International Space Station. This could go a number of ways, but it's hard to think anything good will come of it.</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>.

A hydrogen-fueled New Shepard booster propelled a crew capsule, equipped with the largest windows of any operational spaceship, to an altitude of nearly 65 miles (105 kilometers), just above the internationally recognized boundary between the discernible atmosphere and space, before beginning the descent to landing. The passengers included three Americans—Aymette Medina Jorge, Gretchen Green, and Paul Jeris—along with Canadian Jesse Williams, New Zealand's Mark Rocket, and Panamanian Jaime Alemán, who served as his country's ambassador to the United States.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/rocket-report-spacexs-500th-falcon-launch-why-did-uks-reaction-engines-fail/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/rocket-report-spacexs-500th-falcon-launch-why-did-uks-reaction-engines-fail/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"47d03ea916ac7fa62e180aac848dc4b65d3ff222803100aa491f15ba36af0b42","category":"Tech"}
