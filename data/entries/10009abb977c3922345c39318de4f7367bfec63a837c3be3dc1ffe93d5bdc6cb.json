Check your rules","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2638200/mail-moving-unexpectedly-among-mailboxes-check-your-rules.html","date":1743757200000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>iCloud.com’s Mail app hides a feature that can also trip you up. You can set rules at iCloud.com that affect incoming and filed messages on Apple’s servers before they reach the Mail app on your devices. These rules are separate from the Mac version of Mail and take precedence over any local filtering or sorting set on any mail software you use on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The effect of this can be that messages wind up in places you didn’t expect without any action on your part. You can check for rules at iCloud.com by following these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to the <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/mail/\">Mail web app at iCloud.com</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click the gear icon at the top of the left-hand navigation bar.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click <em>Rules</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you see anything in this space, check to see if any apply to recipients, subjects, or other patterns you’re having problems with.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-icloud-com-mail-rules.png?w=1200\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-icloud-com-mail-rules.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1629w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-icloud-com-mail-rules.png?resize=300%2C219&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-icloud-com-mail-rules.png?resize=768%2C562&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-icloud-com-mail-rules.png?resize=1200%2C877&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-icloud-com-mail-rules.png?resize=1536%2C1123&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"877\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>iCloud.com rules take precedence in filtering and processing email before it reaches your inbox.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also check for local filtering in the Mac Mail app at <em>Mail &gt; Settings &gt; Rules</em>. There, you need to select a rule and click <em>Edit</em> to view its effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For other mailhosts, you can log in to their web interface to see if rules set there are causing issues. I use Fastmail for my main email account, and the service offers both filtering controls and mail rules in Settings.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-fastmail-rules-bordered.png?w=1200\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-fastmail-rules-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1682w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-fastmail-rules-bordered.png?resize=300%2C184&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-fastmail-rules-bordered.png?resize=768%2C471&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-fastmail-rules-bordered.png?resize=1200%2C736&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-fastmail-rules-bordered.png?resize=1536%2C942&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"736\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Other mail host (like Fastmail, shown) may offer on-server filtering and processing rules that can override your email client’s behavior.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Michael.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
