{"title":"Trump Threatens Zuckerberg With ‘Life in Prison’ in New Book","link":"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/28/trump-zuckerberg-election-book-00176639","date":1725460942000,"content":"\n<p>Alex Isenstadt, writing for Politico:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Save-America-Donald-J-Trump/dp/B0D9HS4CWN/\">Save America</a>,” a Trump-authored coffee table book being\nreleased Sept. 3, includes an undated photograph of Trump meeting\nwith Zuckerberg in the White House. Under the photo, Trump writes\nthat Zuckerberg “would come to the Oval Office to see me. He would\nbring his very nice wife to dinners, be as nice as anyone could\nbe, while always plotting to install shameful Lock Boxes in a true\nPLOT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT,” Trump added, referring to a <a href=\"https://electioninnovation.org/press/chan-zuckerberg-increase-2020-election-support/\">$420\nmillion </a> contribution Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla\nChan, made during the 2020 election to fund election\ninfrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>“He told me there was nobody like Trump on Facebook. But at the\nsame time, and for whatever reason, steered it against me,” Trump\ncontinues. “We are watching him closely, and if he does anything\nillegal this time he will spend the rest of his life in prison — as will others who cheat in the 2024 Presidential Election.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I was not aware that “steering” a social network against a presidential candidate was not only illegal, but subject to life in prison. Elon Musk better be careful with anti-Kamala-Harris posts <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1830656672211103825\">like this one</a>, because I’m sure Trump feels just as strongly about “steering” in either direction. The law’s the law, and Donald J. Trump is a stickler for the law — not some sort of <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/98703/chronology-trump-justice-department/\">vindictive thin-skinned crackpot</a> megalomaniac who is obsessed with “life in prison” because it’s looking more and more like that’s his own fate.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/04/trump-zuckerberg-prison\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"dc27d2fbf808dcfe13582e4b03d7f79bd4500ea97c80968fd841f4876f7e780a","category":"Tech"}
