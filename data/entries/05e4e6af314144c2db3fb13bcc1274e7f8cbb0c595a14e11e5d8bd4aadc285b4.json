{"title":"Ncuti Gatwaâ€™s Fifteenth Doctor rocks the fashion in new Doctor Who trailer","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013955","date":1711990212000,"content":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<div><div></div><p>Ncuti Gatwa officially begins his tenure as the Fifteenth Doctor in May, when the new <em>Doctor Who</em> season premieres. </p></div>\n<p>Heads up, Whovians! We've got a newly regenerated Fifteenth Doctor in Ncuti Gatwa and a new season of the long-running British sci-fi series <em>Doctor Who</em> on the way. Judging by the latest trailer, we're in for another wild ride of time-traveling hijinks, punctuated by an irresistibly charismatic Gatwa sporting some very colorful outfits with confident aplomb.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for most recent seasons and specials below.)</strong></p>\n<p>Look, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/review-jodie-whittakers-time-lord-returns-to-classic-doctor-who-form/\">I loved</a> Jodie Whittaker's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/doctor-who-wraps-a-solid-season-with-its-first-female-time-lord/\">incarnation of the Doctor</a>, but her tenure was hampered by the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/04/13th-doctor-teams-up-with-a-pirate-queen-in-legend-of-the-sea-devils-trailer/\">unavoidable fact</a> that showrunner Chris Chibnall just didn't give her a lot of great material to work with. Among other issues, there was an unfortunate tendency toward didacticism and preachiness in the writing at the expense of genuine emotional resonance. While there were a number of notable episodes, and Chibnall gamely trotted out all the fan-favorite monsters and tropes, nothing ever fully captured the imagination in quite the same way as the show has always done at its best. Whittaker deserved better.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013955#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013955&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"05e4e6af314144c2db3fb13bcc1274e7f8cbb0c595a14e11e5d8bd4aadc285b4","category":"Tech"}
