It is the most matte display type that Apple makes, and Apple claims that it is useful for high-end, color-managed workflows or demanding ambient lighting environments.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<blockquote>The expansive 24-inch 4.5K Retina display on iMac is its highest-rated feature, and for the first time, it's available with a nano-texture glass option that drastically reduces reflections and glare, while maintaining outstanding image quality. With nano-texture glass, users can place iMac in even more spaces, such as a sun-drenched living room or bright storefront.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe 2020 27-inch Intel-based <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> was available with a nano-texture display option prior to its discontinuation, so the new ‌iMac‌ marks the first time that the feature has been available with the Apple silicon version of the device.
