Later this year you'll be able to add your ID card to the Wallet app in some U.S. states, and Apple is making it easier to add key cards for hotels, smart home locks, and more to the Wallet app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSpotlight is better than ever and can bring up more tailored search results, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> has a \"Live Text\" feature that lets you take a photo of something with text like a receipt to translate it into typed text on your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>. ‌Photos‌ can also identify landmarks, books, plants, and pets, so you can snap a photo of a plant and get information on what it might be.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has also added multiple privacy improvements, such as a new App Privacy report coming to the ‌iPhone‌ that will let you know how often apps access sensitive info like your location, a Mail feature that hides your IP address, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> processing that's done on device.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor a complete overview of everything that's new in ‌iOS 15‌, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">we have a dedicated roundup</a> that walks through all of the new features, and Apple has been adding feature refinements throughout the beta testing period. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/27/everything-new-in-ios-15-beta-4/\">fourth beta</a>, for example, further tweaked the design of Safari, added <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe Battery Pack</a> support, and more, while <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/10/everything-new-in-ios-15-beta-5/\">the fifth beta</a> added smaller tweaks.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/apple-seeds-ios-15-beta-6-to-developers/\">Apple Seeds Sixth Betas of iOS and iPadOS 15 to Developers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-sixth-betas-of-ios-and-ipados-15-to-developers.2307831/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DgVtVOSRG2E:ZQCMMmnyyQo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DgVtVOSRG2E:ZQCMMmnyyQo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/DgVtVOSRG2E\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e10d39b5b2348f3e44c1472c6ea17472a107a3f3c5ce268b27c9bb9ac9bffeb2","category":"Apple"}
