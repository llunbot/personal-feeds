They sought to question the CEO on the deterioration of his hospital system, which previously included more than 30 hospitals across eight states. Steward filed for bankruptcy in May.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053520#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053520&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9aff0019fee05c4b9208e2b2676650b6afec56bf1bbff7ee72ce22cd26ed0630","category":"Tech"}
