{"title":"Fosstodon’s Measured Take on Facebook and the Fediverse","link":"https://hub.fosstodon.org/facebook-fosstodon-fedi","date":1687360999000,"content":"\n<p>Kev Quirk, co-founder of Fosstodon (a <a href=\"https://fedidb.org/network/instance/fosstodon.org\">60,000-user</a> Mastodon instance):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Truth is, there isn’t that much info out there on how this thing\nwill actually work, or what it will be capable of. Lots of people\nseem to be concerned about Facebook “getting their info”. Fact is,\nthey can do that now if they really want to — it would be trivial\nfor Facebook to stand something up that hoovers up all the public\ndata that’s on the Fediverse, via API.</p>\n\n<p>And that’s the clincher here — <em>it’s all public data</em>. So the\nbest advice I can give if you’re concerned about your data, is\nlock down your account and don’t post publicly.</p>\n\n<p>All that being said, here’s what we plan to do <em>if</em> this thing\never sees the light of day:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>As a team, we will review what the service is capable of and\nwhat advantages/disadvantages such a service will bring to the\nFediverse</li>\n<li>We will then make a determination on whether we will defederate\nthat service</li>\n<li>We will <em>NOT</em> jump on the bandwagon, or partake in the rumour\nmill that seems to be plaguing the Fediverse at the moment</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It’s important to say that neither myself or Mike like anything\nthat Facebook stands for. Neither of us use it, and both of us go\nto great lengths to avoid it when browsing the web. So if this\nservice introduces <em>any</em> issues that could negatively impact our\nusers, we will defederate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bingo.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/21/fosstodon\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b711d36ef2fede74defc7a1ea2f5fd5cd9838954be8f7958633930f46876a436","category":"Tech"}
