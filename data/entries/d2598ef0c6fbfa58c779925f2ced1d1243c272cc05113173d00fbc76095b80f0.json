But they are just beginning to thoroughly measure a “hidden vulnerability” that will make matters far worse: The coastline is also <em>sinking</em>. It’s a phenomenon known as subsidence, and it’s poised to make the rising ocean all the more dangerous, both for people and coastal ecosystems.</p>\n<p>New research <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37853-7\">published</a> in the journal Nature Communications finds that the Atlantic coast—home to more than a third of the US population—is dropping by several millimeters per year. In Charleston, South Carolina, and the Chesapeake Bay, it’s up to 5 millimeters (a fifth of an inch). In some areas of Delaware, it’s as much as twice that.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934883#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934883&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d2598ef0c6fbfa58c779925f2ced1d1243c272cc05113173d00fbc76095b80f0","category":"Tech"}
