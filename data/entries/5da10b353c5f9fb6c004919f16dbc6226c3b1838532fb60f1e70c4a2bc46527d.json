For reference, the Apple Watch Ultra has a 49mm case.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for Apple Watch Ultra, Kuo said it will remain \"roughly the same\" this year, although if production yields meet expectations, a new dark/black case color option could be made available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will also start using 3D printing technology to manufacture Apple Watch components later this year, following extensive testing which has significantly improved the production efficiency. Kuo said BLT will be the supplier of 3D-printed components.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em> previously <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/gurman-apple-watch-x-redesign-planned/\">reported</a> that the 2024 Apple Watch could be labeled the \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-x/\">Apple Watch X</a>\" to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Apple Watch, but Kuo made no mention of this possibility in his latest note. <em>Bloomberg</em> also said that Apple is considering a magnetic band attachment system that will allow the design to be made thinner, but it is unclear whether the system will be ready or present on the 2024 Apple Watch.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Caution)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/\">Kuo: Apple Watch Series 10 to Get Larger Screen and Thinner Design</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-to-get-larger-screen-and-thinner-design.2429393/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5da10b353c5f9fb6c004919f16dbc6226c3b1838532fb60f1e70c4a2bc46527d","category":"Apple"}
