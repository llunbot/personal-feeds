Apple already has the ‌iPhone‌ Upgrade Program that splits the cost of a device across a 12 or 24 month period, but the planned subscription service would have been an ongoing monthly fee rather than payments over a set number of months.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAfter two years of work on the project, Apple apparently ceased development in recent months due to regulatory concerns, software bugs, and other issues. The team that was developing the subscription service was disbanded and reassigned to other projects. Apple has done some streamlining of its payment offerings this year, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-discontinuing-apple-pay-later/\">shutting down</a> the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a> Later pay-in-installments option that was available for less than a year.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/18/apple-drops-iphone-subscription-service-plans/\">Apple Drops Plans for iPhone Hardware Subscription Service</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-drops-plans-for-iphone-hardware-subscription-service.2445734/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"17b368cc7953a5553d657fc298037c82d2272fb108dfb0913feacbd8b70ac89c","category":"Apple"}
