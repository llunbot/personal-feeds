That's when <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/02/android-11-preview-hands-on-notification-changes-dark-mode-options-and-more/\">Android</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/06/ios-13-apple-brings-dark-mode-to-iphones-and-multitasking-overhaul-to-ipads/\">iOS</a> designed a system-wide way to implement a darker theme, and signal to compatible apps to do the same. Many, many systems, apps, websites, and other digital tools soon followed.</p>\n<p>Except, most notably, <a href=\"https://www.wikipedia.org/\">Wikipedia</a>. Despite being one of the sites most sympathetic to late-night mind wandering, Wikipedia had no official way to switch its iconic white pages into something more sleep and eyeball-friendly. Now, after great effort from its community, a dark mode (technically a dark \"Color\" setting) is available to most Wikipedia visitors on both desktop and mobile.</p>\n<p>On desktop, look for a sidebar on the right-hand side that has buttons for setting text size and width, and then \"Color (beta).\" If you don't see a sidebar, look for an eyeglasses-like icon in the upper-right corner near the search and account tools. On mobile, look for the three horizontal bars (aka hamburger button) in the upper-left corner of a page, choose Settings, then pick your Color. There is the standard Light you know, Dark, and Automatic, which takes its color cues from your system.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039811#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039811&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"53954a0daf5a14678df322fb82938caa4a12db8a21de185e262c3c32fbfc1f12","category":"Tech"}
