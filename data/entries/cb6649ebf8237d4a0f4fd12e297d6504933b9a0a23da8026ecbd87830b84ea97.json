The big fourth quarter is over, and any new “Spring” hardware usually launches in March or April. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an outside chance that Apple “direct to the website” launches the M4 MacBook Air this month, ahead of other springtime products we’re not expecting until March or April, but other than that, the new iOS/macOS betas and scrutiny on Siri is going to be what February is all about.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New hardware releases</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve heard for some time now that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">new <strong>M4MacBook Air</strong></a> is in production and should ship “soon.” Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman suggested Apple could launch the new laptop as a standalone release in February, but might hold it for a bigger event in March to go along with other expected spring products like the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/new-iphone-se-release-date-se4-16e-design-specs-features.html\">iPhone SE 4</a>, new iPads, and maybe that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">mysterious new “HomePad” thing</a> we keep hearing about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is expected to be a relatively minor update, just upgrading the processor to an M4 and probably the camera to the 12MP Ultra Wide Center Stage FaceTime camera like you find in the M4 MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple just released <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2558637/ios-18-3-release-date-beta-features-and-compatibility.html\">iOS 18.3</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS 15.3</a> (and related updates), but as January closed out, Apple hasn’t yet released the first iOS 18.4 or macOS 15.4 betas. We expect them soon (possibly this week) because they will need lots of testing. There will probably be a few minor tweaks, but the big component is the big Siri update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Apple announced Apple Intelligence at WWDC last June, it showed a “coming in a later update” Siri that would build a personal profile of you based on the information on your phone, so it can understand your requests and perform actions while understanding your own individual personal context. It also could take actions within apps, thanks to a huge increase in developer hooks called App Intents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting this in the hands of developers so they can update their apps to use these new App Intents is critical, so this is probably going to be a long beta test that goes into wide release in April (Apple has already announced that additional language support for Apple Intelligence is coming in April. Just as importantly, it will be our first look at a new smarter Siri, and let’s face it, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2582521/why-doesnt-siri-know-what-it-doesnt-know.html\">Siri needs big improvements</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is also <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-02/apple-aapl-ai-and-ar-struggles-show-it-has-lost-some-of-its-product-edge?cmpid=BBD020225_POWERON&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=250202&amp;utm_campaign=poweron\">rumored</a> to release an update to the Calendar app that lets you keep track of event invites. It was hidden in the iOS 18.3 beta and could be released this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Services</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple TV+</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the shows, series, and movies we expect to release on Apple TV+ in TK.
