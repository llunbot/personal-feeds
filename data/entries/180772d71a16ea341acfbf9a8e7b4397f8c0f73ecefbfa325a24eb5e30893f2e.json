We've gone through our <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/ars-on-aws-01/\">infrastructure</a>, our <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/ars-on-aws-02/\">application stack</a>, and our <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/ars-on-aws-03/\">CI/CD strategy</a> (that's \"continuous integration and continuous deployment\"—the process by which we manage and maintain our site's code).</p>\n<p>Now, to wrap things up, we have a bit of a grab bag of topics to go through. In this final part, we'll discuss some leftover configuration details I didn't get a chance to dive into in earlier parts—including how our battle-tested liveblogging system works (it's surprisingly simple, and yet it has withstood millions of readers hammering at it during Apple events). We'll also peek at how we handle authoritative DNS.</p>\n<p>Finally, we'll close on something that I've been wanting to look at for a while: AWS's cloud-based 64-bit ARM service offerings. How much of our infrastructure could we shift over onto ARM64-based systems, how much work will that be, and what might the long-term benefits be, both in terms of performance and costs?</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1957664#p3\">Read 50 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1957664&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Lee Hutchinson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"180772d71a16ea341acfbf9a8e7b4397f8c0f73ecefbfa325a24eb5e30893f2e","category":"Tech"}
