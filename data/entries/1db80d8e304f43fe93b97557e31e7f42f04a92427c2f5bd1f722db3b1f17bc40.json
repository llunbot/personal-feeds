In this scenario, spindle breakage means both the interior power meter spindle, but also including the piece that connects to your crank arm, which could certainly result in a crash.</p>\n<p>Thus, Favero is trying to replace the impacted batches. The TLDR here is to open up the Favero app, and it’ll automatically tell you if your batch is impacted. Also, you should have received an e-mail as well.</p>\n<p>But Favero says they know not everyone installs the app, or may have resold pedals to someone else, thus the new buyer wouldn’t have received e-mails unless they re-registered them (or installed the app).</p>\n<h3><span><strong>Full Details:</strong></span></h3>\n<p>In any case, the wording on this is all very specific, staying numerous times this is “not a recall”, but rather more precautionary. Here’s what their statement says:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>October 2nd, 2024</strong><br />\nWe are offering a free commercial substitution for a limited number of Assioma road pedals belonging to specific batches produced between 2021/02 and 2022/09.</p>\n<p>These units present a defect that can, in very rare cases, cause the spindle to break. Fortunately, only a small number of pedals are affected by this potential issue.</p>\n<p>Thanks to our advanced tracking system, we have identified all impacted units and are proactively notifying affected customers through the Favero Assioma app, as well as via email for those who provided it during product activation.</p>\n<p>This initiative is part of our ongoing commitment to providing the highest standards of customer service.</p>\n<p><strong>This is not a recall</strong></p>\n<p>We would like to emphasize that <strong>this is not a recall.</strong></p>\n<p>While we are under no legal obligation to take action, as confirmed by a leading independent certification entity, we are undertaking this free, voluntary substitution as a precautionary measure to ensure our valued customers receive the best possible product experience.</p></blockquote>\n<p>They go on to say that all customers will be contacted by October 13th via either e-mail or push notification from the app. Though, if you open the app right now (<strong>ensure the app itself is updated first</strong>), and connect to the sensors, it should notify you whether or not you’re impacted. If so, it’ll look like this:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"FaveroAssioma-App-Notification.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/10/FaveroAssioma-App-Notification.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"717\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/10/FaveroAssioma-App-Notification.png 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/10/FaveroAssioma-App-Notification-200x199.png 200w\" /></p>\n<p>From there, you’ll basically go through a process to deactivate the pedals, and then they send new pedals. That would mean a few days where you didn’t have an active power meter, but Favero is trying to avoid a scenario where people then sell-off the broken spindle units, and thus the circle of life trying to get those replaced begins again. You won’t be sending back the older pedals, but just discarding them properly.</p>\n<p>Again, all this and slightly <a href=\"https://cycling.favero.com/en/freereplacement01010\">more details are announced here</a>.</p>\n<p>In terms of total production, Favero started production of the <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2017/09/favero-assioma-review.html\">Assioma pedals in summer 2017</a>, and continues making them to this day (in addition to the Favero <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/07/assioma-shimano-variant.html\">Assioma Duo-Shi pedals they started in July 2021</a>, and the off-road focused <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/02/favero-assioma-pro-mx-mtb-spd-power-pedal-review.html\">Favero Assioma Pro MX series earlier this year</a>). The affected timeframe represents about 1.5 years of that 7-year production span, from February 2021 until September 2022. No matter how you slice it, that’s a pretty big pile of pedal spindles (and, in this case, full pedals) to replace.</p>\n<p>I’ve checked all my Favero Assioma pedals, and none fell within the affected timeframe/batches (all seemingly older than that). Obviously, I’d encourage you to check your Favero pedals with the app, because breaking a spindle while pedaling with enough force will almost certainly result in a crash, and probably not a very light one.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading – and go forth and enjoy your weekend!</p>","author":"Ray Maker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"1db80d8e304f43fe93b97557e31e7f42f04a92427c2f5bd1f722db3b1f17bc40","category":"Cycling"}
