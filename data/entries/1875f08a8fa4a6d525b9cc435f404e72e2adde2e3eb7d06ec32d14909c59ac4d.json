Telegram says it intends to continue increasing this limit \"until all humans on Earth can join one group call.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMeanwhile, video messages now have a higher resolution, and any audio playing on the user's device will keep playing when a message is being captured so that it's included in the recording. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, users can now tap on a video message to expand it in the conversation thread. Tapping on an expanded video message initially pauses it, and it's also possible to fast-forward and rewind the message.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nElsewhere in this update, the media player now supports multiple video playback speeds, screen sharing has been added to one-on-one calls, the in-app camera supports all zoom levels a device is capable of, and the media editor includes new tools to illustrate photos and videos with drawings, text, and stickers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSeveral other smaller tweaks and improvements have made it into this bumper update, and Telegram has further details in its <a href=\"https://telegram.org/blog/video-1000\">latest blog post</a>.
