But every now and then, it’s crucial to hit the brakes, or as we like to say, Press Paws, and embark on an adventure with your furry best friend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://ruffwear.com/pages/30-years?utm_source=9486205utm_medium=customarticle&amp;utm_campaign=082824_brand_dsp_u_ruffwear2024&amp;utm_content=brand\" target=\"_blank\">Ruffwear</a> celebrates its 30th anniversary, there’s no better time to reflect on the importance of taking these breaks with our dogs. For 3 decades, Ruffwear has been a trusted name for outdoor enthusiasts and their canine companions, creating gear that not only stands the test of time but also enhances the bond between dogs and their humans. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of dogs — my golden retriever, Blue, is the epitome of an active, <a href=\"https://gearjunkie.com/dogs/ruffwear-crag-leash-crag-collar-dog-review?utm_source=9486205utm_medium=customarticle&amp;utm_campaign=082824_brand_dsp_u_ruffwear2024&amp;utm_content=brand\" target=\"_blank\">outdoor-loving </a>pup, but lately, he’s been confined to the routines of city living. Blue’s bright, adventurous spirit can seem dulled by the monotony of apartment life, and I knew he needed to Press Paws more than anyone. So, I decided to organize a backpacking trip with my closest dog-loving friends in one of the most breathtaking places on earth: the Tetons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This trip wasn’t just about getting away. It was also a celebration of Ruffwear’s 30-year journey, a perfect opportunity to scope out some of the brand’s best gear in the wild. Here’s how our adventure unfolded, and why choosing to Press Paws made all the difference.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://ruffwear.com/?utm_source=9486205utm_medium=customarticle&amp;utm_campaign=082824_brand_dsp_u_ruffwear2024&amp;utm_content=brand\" target=\"_blank\">Learn More About Ruffwear</a>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws-1-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws-1-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ruffwear Press Paws\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws-1-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws-1-297x172.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws-1-120x70.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws-1-768x445.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>The Press Paws crew enjoying the verdant trail up to Alaska Basin; (photo/Sam Morse)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Assembling the Perfect Pack, Ruffwear-Style</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every epic adventure needs a solid crew, and ours was no exception. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First up was Dan Bates, a civil engineer who spends his weekdays buried in blueprints and his weekends working on his property in Victor, Idaho. Dan is the kind of guy who can build anything with his hands, but his true passion lies in the great outdoors. His loyal companion, Beans, a sturdy Bernese mountain dog, is never far behind. With her thick coat and gentle eyes, Beans is as much a part of the landscape as the mountains themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Beans and I don’t get out nearly as much as we should,” Dan shared. “But when we do, I make sure it’s somewhere she can really roam free. This trip was exactly what we both needed to reset.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws2-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws2-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ruffwear Press Paws\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws2-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws2-297x172.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws2-120x70.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws2-768x445.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Dan unleashes (no pun intended) a belly-full of laughter; (photo/Sam Morse)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also joining us was Helen Gurina, a fintech product owner who balances her time between mountaineering, horseback riding, and a good game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helen’s life is a whirlwind of code and creativity, but her heart belongs to her enigmatic dog, Rhaegar. No one’s quite sure of Rhaegar’s exact lineage — a mix of wolf, coyote, and who knows what else — but his wild spirit and piercing gaze make him the ultimate adventure dog.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws3-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws3-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ruffwear Press Paws\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws3-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws3-297x172.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws3-120x70.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws3-768x445.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Helen and Rhaegar lounge in an extremely lush patch of alpine wildflowers; (photo/Sam Morse)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“For Rhaegar, it’s like coming home,” Helen said as Rhaegar trotted ahead of us on the trail, ears perked and tail high. “Being out here in the mountains lets him tap into that wild side. It’s when I see him the happiest, and that makes me happy, too.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite their busy lives, both Dan and Helen prioritize spending time with their dogs. For them, Pressing Paws isn’t just an occasional escape; it’s a necessary ritual that keeps them grounded and connected to what truly matters. With our crew assembled and our dogs eager to explore, we set our sights on Alaska Basin, a remote gem on the Idaho side of the Tetons.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws4-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws4-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ruffwear Press Paws\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws4-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws4-297x172.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws4-120x70.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws4-768x445.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Rhaegar, wearing the <a href=\"https://ruffwear.com/products/hi-and-light-dog-harness?utm_source=9486205utm_medium=customarticle&amp;utm_campaign=082824_brand_dsp_u_ruffwear2024&amp;utm_content=brand\" target=\"_blank\">Hi &amp; Light Dog Harness</a>, plays with Blue in the alpine waters; (photo/Sam Morse)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Pressing Paws — All the Way to Alaska Basin</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our journey began with a challenging hike up to Alaska Basin, a place where the landscape seems to come alive with every step. The trail was lined with lush greenery, and the weather was nothing short of perfect. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we ascended, we were greeted by a kaleidoscope of wildflowers — vivid reds, purples, and yellows — blooming in every direction. Blue and Beans led the charge, their noses to the ground, while Rhaegar moved with a stealthy grace, always alert, always in tune with his surroundings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alaska Basin is known for its stunning alpine lakes, and after several hours of hiking, we reached one of these pristine bodies of water. The dogs wasted no time jumping in, their joy contagious as they splashed and swam in the crystal-clear waters. There’s something about watching your dog revel in nature that reminds you why these moments are so important.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws5-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws5-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ruffwear Press Paws\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws5-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws5-297x172.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws5-120x70.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws5-768x445.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Ruffwear’s <a href=\"https://ruffwear.com/pages/the-new-crux-clip?utm_source=9486205utm_medium=customarticle&amp;utm_campaign=082824_brand_dsp_u_ruffwear2024&amp;utm_content=brand\" target=\"_blank\">Crux Clip</a> easily clips to the <a href=\"https://ruffwear.com/products/hi-light-dog-collar?utm_source=9486205utm_medium=customarticle&amp;utm_campaign=082824_brand_dsp_u_ruffwear2024&amp;utm_content=brand\" target=\"_blank\">Hi &amp; Light Collar</a> — quick, easy, and convenient; (photo/Sam Morse)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We found a secluded campsite where the dogs could roam freely, finally able to unwind from the stresses of everyday life. With towering peaks surrounding us and a blanket of stars overhead, it was the perfect setting to truly disconnect from the world and reconnect with our four-legged friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This spot is a dream,” Helen remarked. “It’s like we’ve found our own little slice of paradise where the dogs can just be dogs, without any distractions. It’s moments like these that remind me why we do this.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws6-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws6-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ruffwear Press Paws\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws6-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws6-297x172.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws6-120x70.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws6-768x445.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Blue enjoys camp time while wearing the <a href=\"https://ruffwear.com/products/front-range-everyday-dog-harness?utm_source=9486205utm_medium=customarticle&amp;utm_campaign=082824_brand_dsp_u_ruffwear2024&amp;utm_content=brand\" target=\"_blank\">Front Range Dog Harness</a> and <a href=\"https://ruffwear.com/products/switchbak-dog-leash?utm_source=9486205utm_medium=customarticle&amp;utm_campaign=082824_brand_dsp_u_ruffwear2024&amp;utm_content=brand\" target=\"_blank\">Switchbak Dog Leash</a>; (photo/Sam Morse)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Celebrating Ruffwear’s 30th Anniversary With Top-Notch Gear</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the trip, Ruffwear’s gear proved its worth time and time again. As we marked Ruffwear’s 30th anniversary, it was fitting to use products that embody the brand’s 3 decades of innovation and dedication to outdoor adventures with dogs. Here are the standout items that made our journey smooth and enjoyable:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><a href=\"https://ruffwear.com/pages/the-new-crux-clip?utm_source=9486205utm_medium=customarticle&amp;utm_campaign=082824_brand_dsp_u_ruffwear2024&amp;utm_content=brand\" target=\"_blank\">Crux Clip</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Ruffwear’s hardware design innovations, the Crux Clip makes attaching and securing gear a breeze, proving itself invaluable throughout our adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><a href=\"https://ruffwear.com/products/hi-and-light-dog-harness?utm_source=9486205utm_medium=customarticle&amp;utm_campaign=082824_brand_dsp_u_ruffwear2024&amp;utm_content=brand\" target=\"_blank\">Hi &amp; Light Dog Harness</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Lightweight and durable, the Hi &amp; Light Dog Harness kept Rhaegar comfortable for hours, especially high up in the alpine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><a href=\"https://ruffwear.com/products/quencher-packable-dog-bowl?utm_source=9486205utm_medium=customarticle&amp;utm_campaign=082824_brand_dsp_u_ruffwear2024&amp;utm_content=brand\" target=\"_blank\">Quencher Waterproof Collapsible Bowl</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect for on-the-go hydration, this waterproof, collapsible bowl was easy to pack and reliable on the trail for keeping all of the pups watered at camp or while hiking.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws7-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws7-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ruffwear Press Paws\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws7-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws7-297x172.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws7-120x70.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws7-768x445.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Ruffwear’s <strong><a href=\"https://ruffwear.com/products/switchbak-dog-leash?utm_source=9486205utm_medium=customarticle&amp;utm_campaign=082824_brand_dsp_u_ruffwear2024&amp;utm_content=brand\" target=\"_blank\">Switchbak Dog Leash</a></strong> and <a href=\"https://ruffwear.com/products/flagline-leash?utm_source=9486205utm_medium=customarticle&amp;utm_campaign=082824_brand_dsp_u_ruffwear2024&amp;utm_content=brand\" target=\"_blank\">Flagline Leash</a> made it easy to tie off the dogs; (photo/Sam Morse)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4><a href=\"https://ruffwear.com/products/front-range-everyday-dog-harness?utm_source=9486205utm_medium=customarticle&amp;utm_campaign=082824_brand_dsp_u_ruffwear2024&amp;utm_content=brand\" target=\"_blank\">Front Range Dog Harness</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Built for comfort and durability, the Front Range Harness was ideal for the tougher, steeper parts of our hike and made Blue a little less likely to yank me down the trail.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><a href=\"https://ruffwear.com/products/hi-light-dog-collar?utm_source=9486205utm_medium=customarticle&amp;utm_campaign=082824_brand_dsp_u_ruffwear2024&amp;utm_content=brand\" target=\"_blank\">Hi &amp; Light Collar</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hi &amp; Light Collar paired perfectly with the harnesses, offering a lightweight, secure fit that held up against the elements and added a bit of flair to Blue’s lustrous mane.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong><a href=\"https://ruffwear.com/products/switchbak-dog-leash?utm_source=9486205utm_medium=customarticle&amp;utm_campaign=082824_brand_dsp_u_ruffwear2024&amp;utm_content=brand\" target=\"_blank\">Switchbak Dog Leash</a></strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Switchbak Leash, with its adjustable length and dual handles, provided control and comfort, no matter the situation.

The reasons are as vast and varied as the landscapes you’ll explore together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, our dogs’ lives are fleeting, their time with us all too brief. Every adventure, every shared moment, is a precious memory in the making. By taking the time to explore the world with your dog, you’re not just building a bond — you’re creating a legacy of love and companionship that will stay with you long after the trails have been walked.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws9-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws9-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ruffwear Press Paws\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws9-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws9-297x172.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws9-120x70.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws9-768x445.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>A truly good boi — Blue takes on cleanup duty wearing the <a href=\"https://ruffwear.com/products/front-range-eve?utm_source=9486205utm_medium=customarticle&amp;utm_campaign=082824_brand_dsp_u_ruffwear2024&amp;utm_content=brandryday-dog-harness\" target=\"_blank\">Front Range Harness</a> and <a href=\"https://ruffwear.com/products/hi-light-dog-collar?utm_source=9486205utm_medium=customarticle&amp;utm_campaign=082824_brand_dsp_u_ruffwear2024&amp;utm_content=brand\" target=\"_blank\">Hi &amp; Light Collar</a> ; (photo/Sam Morse)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s something deeply rewarding about sharing these adventures with your dog. It’s about more than just physical exercise; it’s about the connection you forge in the wild, away from the distractions of daily life. These experiences strengthen the bond between you and your dog, creating a partnership based on trust, understanding, and mutual respect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Getting out here with Beans isn’t just about the exercise,” Dan reflected as we packed up our gear. “It’s about making memories and spending time with her in a way that I just can’t do at home. That’s what makes these trips so special.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws10-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws10-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ruffwear Press Paws\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws10-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws10-297x172.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws10-120x70.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ruffwear-Press-Paws10-768x445.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Beans and Blue are stoked to Press Paws again (very soon!); (photo/Sam Morse)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Pressing Paws is about making memories. It’s about the stories you’ll tell and the moments you’ll treasure, whether it’s watching your dog dive into an alpine lake, hike a mountain ridge, or simply rest happily at the end of a long day. These are the experiences that make life rich, the moments that remind us why we need to Press Paws in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, grab your Ruffwear gear, leash up your dog, and head out into the wild. Press Paws, and discover the adventures that await when you take the time to hang with your dog. Trust me — neither of you will regret it!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article is sponsored by <a href=\"https://ruffwear.com/pages/30-years?utm_source=9486205utm_medium=customarticle&amp;utm_campaign=082824_brand_dsp_u_ruffwear2024&amp;utm_content=brand\" target=\"_blank\">Ruffwear</a>. </em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/how-to-press-paws-and-seize-the-day-with-your-trail-dog/\">How to Press Paws and Seize the Day With Your Trail Dog</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Sam Morse","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"77ca44277b60f4d28d8acc1f5f4533600850c8c8be65c4628d821d4c2d2c3bdb","category":"Cycling"}
