Rumors had initially indicated the headphones would be called \"AirPods Studio,\" and their launch was deemed \"imminent\" for the majority of 2020. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌AirPods Max‌ feature a knit mesh canopy that's flexible to fit various head sizes. The headphones themselves are entirely metal, resulting in a heavy overall footprint. ‌AirPods Max‌ come in five colors: silver, space gray, pink, green, and sky blue. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/airpods-max-colors.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nBorrowing innovations from the Apple Watch, ‌AirPods Max‌ feature a Digital Crown for volume adjustment and a press to invoke <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, as well as a Side Button for toggling on or off Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode. Like all AirPods and select Beats headphones, ‌AirPods Max‌ feature Apple's H1 chip, which powers tight integration with Apple devices, such as easy pairing and automatic device switching.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/airpods-max-digital-crown.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nPriced at $549, ‌AirPods Max‌ are not an inexpensive purchase for customers, and other options such as Apple's own Beats line offer significantly more affordable over-ear headphones. Along with their hefty price tag, however, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/10/airpods-max-unboxing-videos/\">reviews of AirPods Max have been favorable</a>, applauding the headphones for being \"more than enough to compete with other high-end headphones.\" \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌AirPods Max‌ have received some criticism, though, for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/28/third-party-airpods-max-solutions/\">design of the \"Smart Case\"</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/19/airpods-max-excessive-battery-drain/\">poor battery life</a>, the latter of which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/airpods-max-battery-drain-firmware-fix/\">was patched by Apple in a software update</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/05/airpods-max-in-case.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n‌AirPods Max‌ initially saw very high demand that saw <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/08/airpods-max-shipping-estimates/\">shipping estimates stretch out into months</a>, but since the initial backlog was cleared, they've become much more readily available with third-party retailers sometimes even offering even discounts of $100 or more.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max\">AirPods Max (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/15/airpods-max-released-one-year-ago/\">AirPods Max Launched One Year Ago Today</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-max-launched-one-year-ago-today.2327718/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JSA8GFvVcYw:9xLj7R55feg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JSA8GFvVcYw:9xLj7R55feg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f959832f773f65b86cd096d3194648b0da8f7b7af8232ffbf35a2b27cc9d3f6f","category":"Apple"}
