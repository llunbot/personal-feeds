The camera also features Center Stage, which uses machine learning to automatically keep everyone in the field of view. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new iPad Air is nearly 50% faster than the previous iPad Air with M1, according to Apple.

Today, iPad Air gets even better,\" said Bob Borchers, Apple's vice president of Product Marketing. \"We're so excited to introduce the redesigned 11-inch and all-new 13-inch iPad Air, offering two sizes for the first time.
