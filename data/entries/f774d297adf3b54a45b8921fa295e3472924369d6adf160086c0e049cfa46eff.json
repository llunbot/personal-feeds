VisionOS, the software that runs on Vision Pro, supports a Cinematic Environment that allows users to experience shows and movies at the frame rate and aspect ratio chosen by the creator. The feature supports spatial audio, and can also make the virtual screen environment feel 100 feet wide. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple showed off the technology during last week's WWDC keynote and later to invited members of the press, using clips from James Cameron's <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em> to demonstrate its additional ability to render even more immersive content using stereoscopic 3D.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple announced its order for the Godzilla TV series in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/20/apple-godzilla-tv-series/\">January 2022</a>, but has not yet revealed when it will arrive on TV+. The series takes place after the battle between Godzilla and the Titans leveled San Francisco, and will be produced by Legendary Television with co-creator Chris Black serving as executive producer and showrunner. Black is known for his work on \"Star Trek: Enterprise\" and \"Outcast.\"<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/\">Apple TV Shows</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/12/apple-tv-monsterverse-spatial-video-vision-pro/\">Apple TV+ 'Monsterverse' Show Filming in 3D for Vision Pro Viewing</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-monsterverse-show-filming-in-3d-for-vision-pro-viewing.2392665/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f774d297adf3b54a45b8921fa295e3472924369d6adf160086c0e049cfa46eff","category":"Apple"}
