deny that mountain biking is getting more and more technical, with everyday trail riders pushing their limits more and more.</p>\n<p>It’s also fair to say that as time progresses, more of us are taking protection seriously. In my group of riding pals, most now wear at least back protection on even moderate trail-riding days – it’s so comfy, why not?</p>\n<p>Endura’s MT500-level protection is designed for trail, enduro and DH use. The brand has worked with its sponsored riders – the Athertons and Danny MacAskill – to help get it right.</p>\n<p>The front and rear feature D3O panels – a non-Newtonian material that hardens on impact but otherwise remains flexible.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure>\n<div>\n    \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/10/Endura-MT500-Protector-Vest-back-7e56aca.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Endura MT500 Protector Vest back\" title=\"Endura MT500 Protector Vest back\" />\n</div>    <figcaption>\n        <div>\n    <figcaption>\n        <span>The large rear D3O pad extends to your tailbone.</span>\n    </figcaption>\n    <span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / OurMedia</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      </div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure>\n<div>\n    \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/10/Endura-MT500-Protector-Vest-velcro-adjustment-092b742.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Endura MT500 Protector Vest velcro adjustment\" title=\"Endura MT500 Protector Vest velcro adjustment\" />\n</div>    <figcaption>\n        <div>\n    <figcaption>\n        <span>Large Velcro straps make it easier to get the protection on and off, and offer the bulk of the fit provision.</span>\n    </figcaption>\n    <span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / OurMedia</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      </div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure>\n<div>\n    \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/10/Endura-MT500-Protector-Vest-D3O-3c0e163.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Endura MT500 Protector Vest D3O\" title=\"Endura MT500 Protector Vest D3O\" />\n</div>    <figcaption>\n        <div>\n    <figcaption>\n        <span>Flexible and ventilated, the D3O protection is there to do an important job.</span>\n    </figcaption>\n    <span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / OurMedia</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      </div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure>\n<div>\n    \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/10/Endura-MT500-Protector-Vest-adjustment-01ea430.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Endura MT500 Protector Vest adjustment\" title=\"Endura MT500 Protector Vest adjustment\" />\n</div>    <figcaption>\n        <div>\n    <figcaption>\n        <span>Supplementary adjustment, to ensure the fit is just right.</span>\n    </figcaption>\n    <span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / OurMedia</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>These are rated to Level 1 protection, which is as much as you get from mountain bike protection.</p>\n<p>Surrounding the D3O panels are additional foam pads, to add yet more protection.</p>\n<p>Fit is aided by Velcro tabs on either side of the torso.</p>\n<p>The item is at the heavier end of the body-protection scale, however the main pads are vented, and mesh is used where applicable to boost air flow.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>£129.99 / $179.99 / €149.99</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>","author":"Tom Marvin","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"4bab243013bc9d9c52091d3cdf65e8aa555b70e71d898e66e8f3b36ab39035ae","category":"Cycling"}
