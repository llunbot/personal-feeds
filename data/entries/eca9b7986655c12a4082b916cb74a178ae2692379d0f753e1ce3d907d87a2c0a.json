Not the huge billboard-y ones that yell about a few laptop features and invariably leave a huge, sticky-residue rectangle on the palm rest when you try to peel them off. I'm not <em>that</em> weird. But I like the little sometimes-holographic ones about the CPU (and sometimes the GPU) inside your PC.</p>\n<p>If you share my affliction, I recently discovered designs by Vinoth Ragunathan that <a href=\"https://insidesticker.com/\">recreate those holographic stickers</a> for the M1 and M2-series processors in Apple Silicon Macs. Available for $7 a pop (or $16 for three), the stickers for each processor come with <a href=\"https://insidesticker.com/en-us/pages/details\">a different holographic color palette</a>.</p>\n<p>It might horrify those of you who peel these little advertisements off of your PCs as soon as you get them, but we sticker lovers aren't alone. Ragunathan has sold hundreds of these Apple Silicon stickers—over 450 for the M1 Pro version alone—and there's a thriving aftermarket on eBay for case stickers for new and old CPUs from <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=intel+inside+sticker&amp;_sacat=0\">Intel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=amd+case+sticker&amp;_sacat=0&amp;LH_TitleDesc=0&amp;_odkw=intel+inside+sticker&amp;_osacat=0\">AMD</a>, versions of Windows, GeForce and Radeon GPUs, and lots of other components besides. Some people, it turns out, like being able to see what's inside a computer from the outside.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930268#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930268&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"eca9b7986655c12a4082b916cb74a178ae2692379d0f753e1ce3d907d87a2c0a","category":"Tech"}
