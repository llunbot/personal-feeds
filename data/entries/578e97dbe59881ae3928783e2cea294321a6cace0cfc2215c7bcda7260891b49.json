Xiaomi secured third place with 41.8 million units, followed by vivo and OPPO with about 8% market share each.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe U.S. smartphone market was a bright spot, growing 12% year-on-year, mainly driven by iPhone sales. According to Le Xuan Chiew of Canalys, \"Apple proactively built up inventory ahead of anticipated tariff policies,\" which helped it lead the pack.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has been diversifying production recently by ramping up iPhone manufacturing in India for both standard iPhone 15 and 16 models, as well as iPhone 16 Pro models.  Ongoing fluctuations in reciprocal tariff policies are making Apple further <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/25/apple-source-us-bound-iphones-india-2026/\">shift U.S.-bound production to India</a> to reduce exposure to future risks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/global-smartphone-shipments-q1-2025-canalys.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1338\" height=\"1524\" />\r<br />\nThere was a lot of variation in regional demand in Q1. The U.S. market grew substantially and China benefited from government subsidies, but previously strong markets like India, Latin America, and the Middle East had notable declines.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCanalys expects the U.S. smartphone market to experience significant volatility over the next two to three quarters, due to inventory corrections and weakening consumer confidence in the face of fluctuating import tariffs.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/canalys/\">Canalys</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/iphone-shipments-up-global-market-slowdown/\">iPhone Shipments Up 13% Amid Global Smartphone Market Slowdown</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-shipments-up-13-amid-global-smartphone-market-slowdown.2456287/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"578e97dbe59881ae3928783e2cea294321a6cace0cfc2215c7bcda7260891b49","category":"Apple"}
