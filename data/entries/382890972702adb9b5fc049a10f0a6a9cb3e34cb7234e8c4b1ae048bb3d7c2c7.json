Another report released on Thursday lends credence to the shipment of new Macs, specifically new MacBook Pros.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1824130598975443363\">X post</a> (subscription required) by analyst Ross Young of Display Supply Chain Consultants, display panel shipments for the MacBook Pro “are starting in July/August.” Considering that it’s the middle of August, that would indicate that those shipments are already underway. Young tracks the supply chain for displays and has a strong track record of accuracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The timing works with the reported fall release for the M4 MacBook Pro. According to Mark Gurman, Apple is planning to release M4 models of the MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac mini before the end of this year. The M4 MacBook Air, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro will ship in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In October 2023, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2120984/macbook-pro-lineup-with-m3-pro-max-processors-memory-specs.html\">announced the M3 series of the MacBook Pro</a> during its “<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2119519/apple-scary-fast-event-live-updates-mac-macbook-magic-mouse.html\">Scary Fast</a>” event, and the laptop shipped in November. Apple will likely follow suit for this year; the October/November timeline comes in time for the holiday shopping season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MacBook Pro is expected to feature the base M4 in the low-end 14-inch model, and the M4 Pro and M4 Max in higher-end models. Last year, Apple introduced the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max at the same time, a change from the release schedule for M1 and M2 chips. A fall MacBook Pro release and new chip introduction seem like a schedule Apple will maintain for the future.
