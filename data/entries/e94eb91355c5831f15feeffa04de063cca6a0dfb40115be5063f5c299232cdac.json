{"title":"VR review: Space Pirate Trainer’s new “Arena” is massive, must-play (if you can)","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792922","date":1631209518000,"content":"<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/spt-dx-listing-800x450.png\" /><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/spt-dx-listing.png\">Enlarge</a> (credit: I-Illusions)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>If you already thought the average VR use case was too inconvenient, you are absolutely not the target market for <em>Space Pirate Arena</em>. Later today, this brand-new mode lands as a free update to the five-year-old VR hit <em>Space Pirate Trainer</em> (whose new name, <em>Space Pirate Trainer DX</em>, still <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/1663790613725314/\">only costs $15</a> and is a fine VR-action option even for the smallest, weakest VR rigs).</p>\n<p>Like other popular VR games, <em>Space Pirate Arena</em> requires strapping into a face-covering headset, which is inconvenient enough. In good news, this game's wholly free new mode doesn't require any cables, PCs, or external sensors, owing to its exclusivity to the self-contained Oculus Quest platform. You are, in some ways, quite liberated as this brand of space pirate.</p>\n<p>But <em>Arena</em>'s playable convenience ends there, as the mode pushes Quest and Quest 2 headsets to their room-sensing limit: an exact 10 m x 10 m square (32.8 ft x 32.8 ft) in your VR lasering room of choice, not a centimeter (inch) less. This is because <em>Space Pirate Arena</em> is a fully blown laser tag facsimile, meant to resemble the real-life zap-a-rama that you might associate with '80s and '90s malls.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792922#p3\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792922&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e94eb91355c5831f15feeffa04de063cca6a0dfb40115be5063f5c299232cdac","category":"Tech"}
