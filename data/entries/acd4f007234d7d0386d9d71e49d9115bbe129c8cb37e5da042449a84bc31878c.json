The backup date is Wednesday, August 25, should something go awry with the delivery. The test messages are pushed to all phones that have opted in to receive the alert. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To opt in or opt out to the system, you can head over to Settings, then <em>Notifications</em> and scroll down to <em>Government Alerts</em> at the bottom of the page. You can then flip on the <em>Emergency Alerts</em> toggle. When it arrives, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/221599/amber-alerts-on-your-iphone-invasive-frustrating-necessary.html\">the message will consist of a fairly loud alarm sound</a> and repeated vibrations accompanied by a text message and could be startling if you’re in a quiet room. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It shouldn’t last longer than a few seconds but if you want to disable the noise, you can set the <em>Always deliver</em> toggle to off, which will deliver the message without a sound when your iPhone is in silent mode.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"acd4f007234d7d0386d9d71e49d9115bbe129c8cb37e5da042449a84bc31878c","category":"Apple"}
