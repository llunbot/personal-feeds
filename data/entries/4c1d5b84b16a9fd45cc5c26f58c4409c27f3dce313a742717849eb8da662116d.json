But what about those times between workouts? The times where you don’t need the extra calories, but you could use more electrolytes than just water can provide? </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Everyday-Drink-Mix-Lifestyle-Image-Cyclist-with-bottle-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Everyday-Drink-Mix-Lifestyle-Image-Cyclist-with-bottle-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Skratch Labs Everyday drink mix cyclist\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Everyday-Drink-Mix-Lifestyle-Image-Cyclist-with-bottle-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Everyday-Drink-Mix-Lifestyle-Image-Cyclist-with-bottle-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Everyday-Drink-Mix-Lifestyle-Image-Cyclist-with-bottle-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Everyday-Drink-Mix-Lifestyle-Image-Cyclist-with-bottle-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Everyday-Drink-Mix-Lifestyle-Image-Cyclist-with-bottle-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Everyday-Drink-Mix-Lifestyle-Image-Cyclist-with-bottle-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Everyday-Drink-Mix-Lifestyle-Image-Cyclist-with-bottle-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Skratch Labs)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s where the new Skratch Labs Everyday Drink Mix comes in. Formulated to provide hydration for a wide range of activities from short workouts to travel, or just everyday life, Everyday Drink Mix is their first unsweetened, sugar-free and low-calorie drink mix. More importantly, it’s free of any non-nutritive sweeteners that are in almost every other similar drink mix from competing brands. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his years of working with athletes of all types, Skratch Labs’ founder, exercise physiologist, coach, and chef, Dr. Allen Lim has found there are two critical hydration needs for athletes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to customize electrolyte intake or combine additional electrolytes with other Skratch Labs products to attain the sodium and carbohydrate levels for their individual performance needs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The need for an unsweetened hydration option for those who demand electrolytes but don’t need additional caloric energy or want non-nutritive sweeteners.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyday Drink Mix delivers on both with a mix of 400mg sodium, 100mg potassium, 50mg calcium, and 50mg magnesium plus 1-2g of carbohydrates per serving which keeps the osmolality low to prevent GI issues. The mix is gluten-free, dairy-free, nut-free, vegan, kosher, and GMO-free, with each serving of the mix containing ten calories with no sugar, artificial flavorings, dyes, or alternative sweeteners like stevia, monk fruit, sucralose, or allulose.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-Wellness-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix.png\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"278\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-Wellness-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix-800x278.png\" alt=\"Skratch Labs Everyday drink mix wellness\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-Wellness-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix-800x278.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-Wellness-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix-297x103.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-Wellness-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix-120x42.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-Wellness-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix-768x267.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-Wellness-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix-1536x535.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-Wellness-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix-2048x713.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-High-Sodium-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix.png.png\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"278\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-High-Sodium-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix.png-800x278.png\" alt=\"Skratch Labs Everyday drink mix high sodium\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-High-Sodium-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix.png-800x278.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-High-Sodium-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix.png-297x103.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-High-Sodium-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix.png-120x42.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-High-Sodium-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix.png-768x267.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-High-Sodium-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix.png-1536x535.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-High-Sodium-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix.png-2048x713.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-Clear-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix.png\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"278\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-Clear-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix-800x278.png\" alt=\"Skratch Labs Everyday drink mix Clear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-Clear-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix-800x278.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-Clear-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix-297x103.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-Clear-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix-120x42.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-Clear-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix-768x267.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-Clear-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix-1536x535.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recreate-Skratch-Labs-Clear-Hydration-With-New-Everyday-Drink-Mix-2048x713.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a fan of any of the retired Skratch Labs formulas like Clear, Wellness, or High Sodium, you’re also in luck as you can use the new Everyday Drink Mix to replicate those products. Combining Everyday Drink Mix with either Sport Drink Mix or Super High Carb Drink Mix in the quantities shown above will make your own version of the three. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Skratch-labs-everyday-drink-mix.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Skratch-labs-everyday-drink-mix.jpg\" alt=\"Skratch Labs Everyday Drink Mix\n\n\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Skratch-labs-everyday-drink-mix.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Skratch-labs-everyday-drink-mix-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Skratch-labs-everyday-drink-mix-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Skratch-labs-everyday-drink-mix-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Skratch-labs-everyday-drink-mix-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Skratch-labs-everyday-drink-mix-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Skratch-labs-everyday-drink-mix-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Launching before summer, Everyday Drink Mix will initially be sold in Lemon + Lime and Tangerine + Orange, with seasonal flavors in development.
