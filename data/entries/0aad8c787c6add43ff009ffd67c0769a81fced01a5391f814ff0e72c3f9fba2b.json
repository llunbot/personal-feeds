{"title":"How to Watch Apple's 'Scary Fast' Event on October 30 (or 31, Depending Where You Are)","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-apple-scary-fast-event-oct-30/","date":1698577200000,"content":"Apple is hosting an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/\">online streaming event</a> for the public and press on Monday, October 30, 2023 at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time. The company is expected to announce new Macs, and potentially other products during the event, dubbed \"Scary Fast.\" Here's how you can watch it and when, depending where you are in the world.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Event-October-2023.jpeg\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\" />\r<br />\nThere are multiple ways to watch the October 30 event, with details listed below. We've also included a useful guide on when the event will take place in your particular time zone. \r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-october-2023-event/\">What to Expect at Apple's \"Scary Fast\" Event</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nHolding an event at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time is an unusually late time for Apple, and for most regions and territories east of London it will actually take place on the morning of Tuesday, October 31 — or Halloween for many. So make sure you don't accidentally miss it because of the odd timing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Events Website</h2>\r<br />\nWith the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/\">Apple Events website</a>, you can watch the event live on a Mac, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>‌, PC, or any other device with a web browser. The Apple Events website works in Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and other main browsers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-events-website-october-30.jpg\" width=\"1067\" height=\"903\" />\r<br />\nJust navigate to <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/\">www.apple.com/apple-events/</a> using a web browser at the appropriate time to watch. You can visit the site now to add an event reminder to your calendar.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>YouTube</h2>\r<br />\nApple also plans to stream the event <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/ctkW3V0Mh-k?si=eN_kCGjo2wrffUee\">live on YouTube</a>, which is perhaps the easiest and most efficient way to watch because the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/ctkW3V0Mh-k?si=eN_kCGjo2wrffUee\">YouTube live stream</a> can be viewed on every platform where YouTube is available, which is pretty much all platforms, from smartphones and tablets to consoles and smart TVs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nApple has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/ctkW3V0Mh-k?si=eN_kCGjo2wrffUee\">posted a placeholder for the October 30 event</a> on YouTube, and you can visit it now to set an event reminder.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple TV App</h2>\r<br />\nApple used to have a dedicated Apple Events app on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, but ahead of WWDC 2020, it was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/18/events-app-apple-tv-app-wwdc/\">folded into the Apple TV app</a>. On event day, there will be a prominent ‌‌Apple TV‌‌ app section dedicated to the live stream, which can be watched on any device where the ‌‌Apple TV‌‌ app is available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/appleevents1.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1112\" />\r<br />\nThis includes the ‌‌Apple TV‌‌, iPhones, iPads, and Macs, as well as select smart TVs, streaming devices, and gaming consoles. If you have an ‌‌Apple TV‌‌, the ‌‌Apple TV‌‌ app is one of the best ways to watch the event live. Apple hasn't updated the ‌‌Apple TV‌‌ app with the new event as of yet, but it should be added soon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>When to Watch the Apple Event</h2>\r<br />\nUnlike most Apple events, the company's \"Scary Fast\" event will take place at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time.
