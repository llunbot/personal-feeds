Hot on the heels of the recently launched<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/argonaut-supernaut-gr3-gravel-rm3-road-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\"> D33 gravel wheels</a>, the R43 wheels are designed for the ultimate performance and ride quality on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-pair-first-picture-jpeg-e1733948055425.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"714\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-pair-first-picture-jpeg-e1733948055425.webp\" alt=\"Argonaut Cycles R43 Wheelset pair first picture\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-pair-first-picture-jpeg-e1733948055425.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-pair-first-picture-jpeg-e1733948055425-297x166.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-pair-first-picture-jpeg-e1733948055425-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-pair-first-picture-jpeg-e1733948055425-768x428.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Argonaut Cycles)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new R43 Wheels are built with proprietary rim profiles and Argonaut’s “thoughtful selection” of spokes and hubs, keeping serviceability and longevity in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Keep it Stiff</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the core of the R43 wheel design philosophy is stiffness. The Argonaut R43 hoop was engineered to be “incredibly stiff”, ensuring all of the power from the rider gets fully delivered to the road. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-logo-jpeg-e1733948086427.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"644\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-logo-jpeg-e1733948086427.webp\" alt=\"Argonaut Cycles R43 Wheelset logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-logo-jpeg-e1733948086427.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-logo-jpeg-e1733948086427-297x149.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-logo-jpeg-e1733948086427-120x60.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-logo-jpeg-e1733948086427-768x386.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When the rider uses Argonaut’s compliant frames, they can experience a smooth ride that doesn’t sacrifice the rigidity and responsiveness of the wheel. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Keep it Aero</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Argonaut R43 Wheels feature a 43mm rim depth. They chose this depth for its balance between being aerodynamic and lightweight. After extensive research and testing, Argonaut found that a 43mm rim depth offers significant aero benefits compared to a shallower rim. But any deeper, and you start paying a more significant weight penalty, which is why they feel 43mm is the sweet spot. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-aero-profile-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-aero-profile-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Argonaut Cycles R43 Wheelset aero profile\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-aero-profile-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-aero-profile-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-aero-profile-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-aero-profile-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-aero-profile-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-aero-profile-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-full-wheel-jpeg-e1733948129906.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"736\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-full-wheel-jpeg-e1733948129906.webp\" alt=\"Argonaut Cycles R43 Wheelset full wheel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-full-wheel-jpeg-e1733948129906.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-full-wheel-jpeg-e1733948129906-297x171.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-full-wheel-jpeg-e1733948129906-120x69.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-full-wheel-jpeg-e1733948129906-768x442.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Superior Build</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every move made during the design of the R43 was focused on performance. The wheels are built with incredibly strong and light DT Aerolite spokes. The construction is said to be completed to a precise tension of 125kg. This ensures durability and performance under the most demanding scenarios. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-rim-tape-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-rim-tape-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Argonaut Cycles R43 Wheelset rim tape\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-rim-tape-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-rim-tape-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-rim-tape-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-rim-tape-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-rim-tape-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Argonaut-Cycles-R43-Wheelset-rim-tape-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, the hidden nipples will further enhance the R43 Wheels aerodynamic profile, further reducing drag (and possibly irritating mechanics who have to work on them).
