NXTG Racing is a Dutch U23 women’s team, the only U23 UCI team.</p><p>D’hoore has been racing since 2007 and was part of teams like Wiggle in 2015, 2016, and 2017 before she rode for Mitchelton-Scott in 2018. She joined Boels-Dolmans in 2019 and rode for the top team for the rest of her career.</p><p>D’hoore has major wins at the Madrid Challenge by La Vuelta, the Tour of Chongming Island, the Ovo Energy Tour in the UK, the Giro Rosa, not to mention a long list of impressive one-day victories. She also raced at the top level on the track and competed in the Madison at the Tokyo Olympic Games this summer.</p><p>“I’m really looking forward to my new adventure with NXTG Racing,” D’hoore said in the team press release. “The team has a really clear vision about women’s cycling, which I totally support. I think it’s really important that they give young cyclists a chance to develop themselves in a safe environment. I have a lot of experience in cycling and I would like to teach the girls all those things. I’m super excited to be a part of NXTG Racing and I’m looking forward to next season.”</p><p>The news that another retiring professional will be moving into management in 2022 is fantastic.
