Apple's audio editing app Logic Pro is also compatible with the new iPad mini, as that app merely requires any iPad model with an A12 Bionic chip or newer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, some Final Cut Pro features are not compatible with the new iPad mini due to hardware or software limitations, as outlined in the app's description.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe have also confirmed that the new iPad mini is not compatible with the Stage Manager feature, which is not very surprising given the device's smaller 8.3-inch display size compared to the larger 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro and iPad Air models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn supported iPads, Stage Manager allows users to resize apps into overlapping windows for an improved multitasking experience. Stage Manager also fully supports an external display with up to 6K resolution, allowing users to work with up to four apps on the iPad and up to four apps on the external display simultaneously.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new iPad mini launches this Wednesday.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/final-cut-pro/\">Final Cut Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/stage-manager/\">Stage Manager</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/22/ipad-mini-7-compatible-with-final-cut-pro/\">New iPad Mini Compatible With Final Cut Pro, But Lacks Stage Manager</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipad-mini-compatible-with-final-cut-pro-but-lacks-stage-manager.2440692/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aa2d5edd150afca6570e8c5a39ae063cc9907afb6d11143b55e72ed6a0bf95cb","category":"Apple"}
