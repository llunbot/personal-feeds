I don't mean a game made by another studio that copies <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/zelda/\"><em>Zelda</em></a> concepts while adding violence, cursing, or gothic architecture—we've seen plenty of those. I'm more curious how Nintendo itself might craft a 3D, \"E-10\" rated adventure—full of magical melee combat, puzzles, charm, and meticulous art direction—that somehow takes the series into a more sinister direction.</p>\n<p>My praise for this week's <em>Kena: Bridge of Souls</em>, the first-ever game from Ember Lab, is that it is as close to that pitch as I've seen since the <em>Zelda</em> series revolutionized the 3D adventure genre. This new, 15-hour series premiere is exhilarating, accessible, cute, gorgeous, ominous, and above all, touching.</p>\n<p><em>K:BoS</em> doesn't necessarily exceed what we got from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/refreshing-new-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-is-an-instant-classic/\">Nintendo's 2017 classic <em>Breath of the Wild</em></a>, and its occasional slip-ups and issues are firm reminders that its creators are a bit green. But there's something special here, in a debut game that most studios would kill to launch as their third or fourth game.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796788#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796788&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4b2c01c911e6b632f5ccc4cfe7f757de7a89d6807b60bc78ebc942e1a0502d97","category":"Tech"}
