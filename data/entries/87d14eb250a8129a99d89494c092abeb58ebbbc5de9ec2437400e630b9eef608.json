Notably, it has been rumored that the next iPad Air will be released in two sizes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-Air-12.9-Inch-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2192\" height=\"1233\" />\r<br />\nApple's supply chain started shipments of display panels for a larger 12.9-inch iPad Air this month, according to a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1733886638210809912\">post on X today</a> from Ross Young, CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants. Young has a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/\">good track record</a> for display-related Apple rumors, so the information he shared today is likely accurate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>12.9” iPad Air panel shipments started in December…</p>— Ross Young (@DSCCRoss) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1733886638210809912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 10, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nMultiple other sources have claimed that Apple is planning to release a 12.9-inch iPad Air, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-working-on-larger-ipad-air/\">Taiwanese supply chain publication <em>DigiTimes</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/12/larger-ipad-air-launching-early-2024/\">Apple analyst Ming-Chu Kuo</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/ipad-air-ipad-pro-2024-refresh/\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Earlier this week, Gurman said that he expects the 12.9-inch iPad Air to be released around March 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBeyond its larger display size, no major design changes have been rumored yet for the 12.9-inch iPad Air. The current iPad Air is equipped with a 10.9-inch display, and that model is also expected to be updated around March next year. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe next iPad Pro models are widely expected to be equipped with OLED displays, and they will likely be more expensive than the current iPad Pro models as a result. By sticking with a more cost-friendly LCD panel, the 12.9-inch iPad Air should be priced between the 10.9-inch iPad Air and the next 11-inch iPad Pro.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/\">Ross Young</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/12-9-inch-ipad-air-display-shipments/\">12.9-Inch iPad Air Display Shipments Reportedly Underway Ahead of March 2024 Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/12-9-inch-ipad-air-display-shipments-reportedly-underway-ahead-of-march-2024-launch.2413333/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"87d14eb250a8129a99d89494c092abeb58ebbbc5de9ec2437400e630b9eef608","category":"Apple"}
