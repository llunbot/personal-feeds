The cutout is largely in line with rumors of what we can expect in the ‌iPad mini‌ 6, including a larger display in lieu of a Home button, a thinner body, and flat edges.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/ipad-mini-6-cutout.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe images originated from the website <a href=\"https://techordo.com\">techordo.com</a> in cooperation with a leaker named <a href=\"https://twitter.com/xleaks7/status/1427957991618318350?s=20\">xleaks7</a>, whose track record for accurate leaks isn't very well established. The cutout showcases a design much in line with renders of the upcoming ‌iPad mini‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/11/ipad-mini-6-thinner-bezels-usb-c-rumor/\">shared by Apple leaker Jon Prosser earlier in June</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new ‌iPad mini‌ will take inspiration from the updated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> by ditching the Home Button in favor of an all-screen design. Apple is unlikely to provide users with Face ID embedded into the bezel and is expected instead to integrate <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> into the power button, similar to the ‌iPad Air‌. It's also expected to feature a faster processor and possibly USB-C. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nReliable <em>Bloomberg</em> journalist Mark Gurman has reported that the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/12/sixth-generation-ipad-mini-this-fall/\">iPad mini is on track to be released this fall</a>, alongside new iPhones, Apple Watches, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>, and MacBook Pros. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini 5</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/duanrui/\">DuanRui</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/19/alleged-cutout-of-sixth-generation-ipad-mini/\">Aluminum Cutout Allegedly Based on iPad Mini 6 Showcases Thinner Bezels, Larger Camera, Touch ID in Power Button</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/aluminum-cutout-allegedly-based-on-ipad-mini-6-showcases-thinner-bezels-larger-camera-touch-id-in-power-button.2308018/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=iYVynqNMe2Q:DzJXBwKWrWs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=iYVynqNMe2Q:DzJXBwKWrWs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/iYVynqNMe2Q\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2caa4f13bda8402cccad0dd03b606b7b98eaab40369b83f047f995aad1f43207","category":"Apple"}
