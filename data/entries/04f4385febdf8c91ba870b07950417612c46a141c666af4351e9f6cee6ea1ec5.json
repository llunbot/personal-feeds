Monitors that are well suited to the Mac and come with the appropriate software are few and far between. However, Dell recognized the need and released the <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100470607-12839518?sid=1-1-2343726-1-0-0&amp;url=https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000201067/dell-display-and-peripheral-manager-for-macos\" target=\"_blank\">Dell Display and Peripheral Manager for the Mac software</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes many newer Dell displays viable Mac solutions. One particularly interesting model is the U2723QE: a 27-inch display with a 4K panel, powerful charging function, and plenty of connections.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h2>Dell UltraSharp U2723QE: Specifications</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Size</td><td>27 inch IPS</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>3840 x 2160 pixels</td></tr><tr><td>Brightness/HDR</td><td>400 nits</td></tr><tr><td>Response time</td><td>8 ms</td></tr><tr><td>Refresh rate</td><td>60 Hertz</td></tr><tr><td>Color ranges</td><td>100% Rec.709, 100% sRGB, 98% DCI-P3</td></tr><tr><td>Ports</td><td>2x USB-C PD<br />5x USB-A<br />gigabit ethernet<br />DP-in/DP-out<br />1x HDMI<br />USB-C upstream (for daisy chain)</td></tr><tr><td>Power delivery</td><td>Yes (90 watts) USB-C + (15 watts) USB-C</td></tr><tr><td>USB hub</td><td>Yes (5x USB-A, 1x USB-C)</td></tr><tr><td>Audio</td><td>Line-out</td></tr><tr><td>Webcam</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>US$550/UK£506/CA$730/AU$791</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dell UltraSharp U2723QE: Setup</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of the box, the U2723QE requires some assembly. The base that houses a practical cable guide and stand must first be screwed together and then attached to the Vesa connection of the display, which is rounded at the back, reminiscent of older iMacs. This can be done in a minute without tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the U2723QE, Dell uses a lot of plastic and the narrow stand doesn’t initially inspire much confidence. However, once assembled, set up, and plugged in, the U2723QE stands very reliably. Nothing wobbles, instead the monitor stands solidly and elegantly on the desk. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stand allows tilting (-5 degrees or +21 degrees), swiveling (±30 degrees), height adjustment by around 16 centimeters (6.3 inches), and pivoting. The height adjustment isn’t particularly smooth, however. It is interesting to note that the screen can be set very low–but be careful, the cables can get in the way here, as they can get caught in the narrow guidehole when adjusting the monitor. They should be pushed in manually when adjusting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U2723QE connects to the Mac with a USB-C cable. When connected, the monitor charges MacBooks and other laptops with up to 90 watts, enough even for a MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the charging function and, of course, the transmission of the video signal, the single USB-C cable also connects the display’s hub with six USB ports and gigabit ethernet. This makes the display a complete USB-C docking station for MacBooks and a good extension for the Mac mini or Mac Studio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two of the USB ports (one USB-A and one USB-C) are located on the bottom edge of the display and are easily accessible. That USB-C port also has a charging function, but at 15 watts it is only suitable for smartphones or other small devices. Another USB-C upstream port on the back is used to connect a second U2723QE in a daisy chain.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 6000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption>Connectivity: The Dell U2723QE comes with many ports, including Ethernet.</figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 6000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>Connectivity: The Dell U2723QE comes with many ports, including Ethernet.</figcaption></figure></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 6000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSCF1176.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>Connectivity: The Dell U2723QE comes with many ports, including Ethernet.</figcaption></figure></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The ports on the back are hard to reach and not entirely in logical positions. The two connections at the front are also arranged at the bottom, which makes plugging them in from the bottom a gymnastics exercise every time. A side or rear-facing solution like Apple’s would be better here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also good: The monitor has an internal power supply unit, and the power plug is attached directly to the device. This display does not have speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dell UltraSharp U2723QE: Image quality</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dell advertises the U2723QE with “exceptional contrast.” This is made possible by the panel’s IPS Black technology. Indeed, the screen offers an unusually high contrast ratio of 2000:1: black looks like black, and colors are very clearly distinguishable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to its wide color space support (100 percent Rec.709, 100 percent sRGB, and 98 percent DCI-P3) it is on par with modern Apple LCDs. The maximum brightness of 400 nits, which is lower than the Apple Studio Display’s 600 nits, but it’s sufficient for most people. There were no visible shadows or halos on our test unit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The display offers various pre-calibrated modes, such as for DCI-P3. However, manual calibration is recommended for the optimum setting when editing images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The resolution of the U2723QE is 3840 by 2160 pixels. For full Retina operation (pixel quadrupling like the iMac or MacBook Pro) the display would have to run with a virtual resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels, which in practice leads to a “too large” display. It is better to use the QHD equivalent of 2560 by 1440 pixels, which the monitor displays very well, albeit with minimal blurring. This is relativized by the normal viewing distance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dell UltraSharp U2723QE: Dell Display Manager controls</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The screen settings can be adjusted using the joystick on the back, or directly from the Mac desktop using the Dell Display and Peripheral Manager software. Here you can quickly adjust the brightness and contrast. There is also the option of defining a schedule for changing the brightness or contrast. If required, users can also define hotkeys for brightness and contrast control. Unfortunately, there is no synchronized control with the MacBook’s internal display, as is <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://lunar.fyi&amp;xcust=1-1-2343726-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">possible with Lunar</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the Dell Display Manager also includes control of the KVM function. If required, software can be installed for this purpose, which means that in addition to the monitor, wired keyboards and mice can also be quickly switched between two connected end devices such as a MacBook and a desktop PC. The screen allows application windows to be quickly arranged in any grid using Easy Arrange. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a PowerNap mode, which saves power when a screen saver is active by dimming the monitor or switching it off while the saver is running.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dell webcams can also be controlled via the software, and firmware updates also find their way to the monitor with the Display Manager. In short, the Display Manager makes life with Dell monitors much easier and is a good argument in favor of monitors from this manufacturer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One major issue that was confounding is that the software works on the MacBook, Mac mini, and Mac Pro, but not on the iMac–this is specifically called out by Dell. The iMac already has a large 24-inch display, but you can still use the U2723QE with it, but you can’t use the Dell Display Manager software with the Dell display. The software only supports devices running macOS 11 or later, and 2018 Mac or later; users with such devices should check whether the software can be installed before purchasing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy the Dell UltraSharp U2723QE?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking for a screen for your MacBook or Mac mini, the overall package of the Dell U2723QE is well put together. This monitor is well-equipped, has an excellent picture, and is very bright. Its highlight is the built-in hub that not only brings a total of six USB ports but also an ethernet port. Thanks to the 90-watt charging power, the screen becomes a docking station–and the price is right, especially when compared to Apple’s offerings</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on </em><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macwelt.de/article/2267485/dell-u2723qe-test.html&amp;xcust=1-1-2343726-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><em>Macwelt</em></a><em> and was translated by </em><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/author/rloyola\"><em>Roman Loyola</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\nMac, Monitors</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"04f4385febdf8c91ba870b07950417612c46a141c666af4351e9f6cee6ea1ec5","category":"Apple"}
