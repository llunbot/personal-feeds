It exploits “device code flow,” a form of authentication formalized in the industry-wide <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-device-flow-07#section-3.4\">OAuth standard</a>. Authentication through device code flow is designed for logging printers, smart TVs, and similar devices into accounts. These devices typically don’t support browsers, making it difficult to sign in using more standard forms of authentication, such as entering user names, passwords, and two-factor mechanisms.</p>\n<p>Rather than authenticating the user directly, the input-constrained device displays an alphabetic or alphanumeric device code along with a link associated with the user account. The user opens the link on a computer or other device that’s easier to sign in with and enters the code. The remote server then sends a token to the input-constrained device that logs it into the account.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/02/russian-spies-use-device-code-phishing-to-hijack-microsoft-accounts/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/02/russian-spies-use-device-code-phishing-to-hijack-microsoft-accounts/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f9001ae2d8d0766c366ab4b0f896fc7c047eb97cd1d9af82e2f08c133573111c","category":"Tech"}
