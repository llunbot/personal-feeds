Founded in 2014, the brand has made products for Colnago and even shoes for Tadej Pogačar’s first season with UAE Team Emirates.</p>\n<p>Saddles are Berk’s main product line, with the Lupina Short being a snub-nose version of the brand’s popular Lupina model.</p>\n<p>The Lupina Short has a claimed weight of 95g, and features a full carbon fibre construction with the oval rails bonded to the saddle’s underside.</p>\n<p>Because of its light weight, Berk sets a maximum rider weight of 100kg for the Lupina Short, something I’m sure most hill climbers won’t be affected by.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Berk Comic Saddle\" title=\"Berk Comic Saddle\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The white Innegra fibre can bee seen in the carbon weave of the seat.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Being quite a short saddle, the Slovenian brand says it has manufactured some flex into the seat portion by using Innegra fibre within the carbon layup to add comfort.</p>\n<p>This limited-edition version is finished with a comic theme featuring a collage of pop art and political figures, with Andy Warhol’s image of Blondie singer Debbie Harry featuring under the left buttock and Barack Obama’s head replacing the rivet.</p>\n<p>The saddle features a cut-out, which is said to help prevent pressure on the perineum.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Berk Comic bar tape\" title=\"Berk Comic bar tape\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The limited-edition saddle also comes with pattern-matched bar tape with carbon fibre Berk-branded bar plugs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Berk says the saddle features a ‘T’ shape, which can be seen in the wide nose of the saddle. The brand says it reduces the amount of friction when pedalling.</p>\n<ul><li>£310</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Wolf Tooth Waveform

Tooth’s Waveform pedals feature 11 pins on each side.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>These pedals from US-based brand Wolf Tooth are CNC’d from a single billet of aluminium and feature a dual-concave platform that’s 12.5mm thick in the centre and 14mm thick on the perimeter.</p>\n<p>Wolf Tooth says the dual-concave platform helps prevent your foot from moving not only front and back, but also from side to side.</p>\n<p>This is assisted by 11 stainless steel pins on either side of the pedal for added grip, with Wolf Tooth providing six spare pins in the box.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Wolftooth Waveform Pedal pin\" title=\"Wolftooth Waveform Pedal pin\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The pins are screwed in from the rear with an Allen key.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Waveform pedals come in two sizes, Small and Large, to better fit your shoe size.</p>\n<p>The Small version is 105x99mm and weighs 373g, while the Large is 112x106mm and is 11g heavier at 384g.</p>\n<p>The pedals feature three sealed bearings, with a custom radial seal on the spindle to protect the internal components from trail debris.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Wolftooth Waveform Pedal in hand\" title=\"Wolftooth Waveform Pedal in hand\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The pedals are labelled with their correct side on the bottom.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The body of the pedal features tapered edges to deflect rock strikes, and engraved onto the platforms are an ‘L’ and ‘R’ to denote on which side the pedal belongs – a handy feature for someone changing pedals frequently.</p>\n<p>The Waveform pedals are available in eight colours and come with a five-year warranty.</p>\n<ul><li>£195/$199</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n

href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/bikepacking/\">bikepacking</a>, with the Merino Wool Caliswe T-Shirt featuring two randonnées touring by bike.</p>\n<p>The shirt is made from a 50/50 wool-polyester blend, which should keep it breathable on hot days.</p>\n<p>I am a big advocate of Merino T-shirts when touring, because the casual style allows for everyday tourist activity while still remaining breathable on the bike.</p>\n<p>Wool’s antimicrobial properties also mean it can be worn for more than one day without needing to stop at a laundromat.</p>\n<div>\n    <img

pocket doesn’t feel big enough for a phone.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The rear of the Merino Wool Caliswe T-Shirt features a zip pocket big enough for keys or credit cards and has a string-pull zipper.</p>\n<p>A cycling cut is used in the form of a high-low hem, with the shirt being slightly longer at the back to compensate for the back arch when riding.</p>\n<ul><li>£80</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Bell Sanction 2 DLX</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\"

out there.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Bell’s new Sanction 2 DLX helmet looks to borrow its design heavily from the brand’s range-toping Full-10 downhill helmet and features 14 vents for cooling.</p>\n<p>A Fidlock buckle is used for fastening, which should enable one-handed release, while the inside of the helmet features a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-mips/\">MIPS</a> lining to reduce rotational forces from certain impacts.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bell

<i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Bell says the helmet is made from a durable ABS shell with an EPS liner, which helps keep the weight down – with the helmet said to weigh 1,080g for a size medium.</p>\n<p>The helmet is rated for downhill and BMX riding, and uses an Ionic+™ Antimicrobial comfort liner, which uses silver metallised yarn to reduce odour.</p>\n<ul><li>£179.99</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>","author":"Nick
