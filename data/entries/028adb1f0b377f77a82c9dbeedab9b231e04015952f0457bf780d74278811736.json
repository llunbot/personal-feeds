Atoms’s excellent Model 000 is a sneaker-style everyday shoe, available not just in half sizes but <em>quarter</em> sizes for a perfect fit. Atoms’ stretchy laces make it easy to slip the shoes on and off. Insoles made with copper thread neutralize odor. And lightweight materials make Atoms exceptionally comfortable and durable. My much-worn pair — size 12.25, quarter sizes for the win — is well over a year old and still look great.</p>\n\n<p>For the holidays, Atoms has launched three new colorways, a limited edition art collaboration, and also brought back the popular Navy Blue and Neons. On top of that, Atoms is offering Daring Fireball readers $20 off one pair or $50 off two. A great deal for great shoes.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/12/04/atoms\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"028adb1f0b377f77a82c9dbeedab9b231e04015952f0457bf780d74278811736","category":"Tech"}
