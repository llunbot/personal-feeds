Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>PUGLIA, ITALYâ€”At a recent media drive program in Puglia, Italy, Maserati introduced the production version of the all-electric Grecale Folgore. The svelte SUV will join the American lineup for model-year 2025 as the company's second-ever EV, following the 2024 GranTurismo Folgore.</p>\n<p>Similar to the GranTurismo, development of the Grecale chassis always included plans to electrify the model. But unlike the GT, Grecale does not receive a dogbone-style battery and triple drive unit layout, instead sticking with by-now-traditional skateboard underpinnings and dual 205-kilowatt motors that swap in for the spectacular twin-turbo \"Nettuno\" V6 engine used on the lower Modena and Trofeo trims.</p>\n<p>Total combined output maxes out at 550 hp (410 kW) and 605 lb-ft (820 Nm) of torque, or about 30 hp (22 kW) more than the former top-spec internal-combustion Trofeo trim. Only a few years ago, those power figures for either a gasoline or battery-electric drivetrain would have placed the Grecale at the top of the SUV food chain. Throw in the reactive nature of instantaneous torque, as well as all-wheel-drive traction, and 605 lb-ft should sound pretty impressive.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010432#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010432&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a6e89e9e51ecffdb712afd5b5fa41093c35d92d671f366b46805de1596b824f5","category":"Tech"}
