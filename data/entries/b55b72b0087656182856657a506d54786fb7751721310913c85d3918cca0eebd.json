{"title":"Jeff Bezos: ‘The Hard Truth: Americans Don’t Trust the News Media’","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/28/jeff-bezos-washington-post-trust/","date":1730165875000,"content":"\n<p>Jeff Bezos, in an op-ed in his Washington Post:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Let me give an analogy. Voting machines must meet two\nrequirements. They must count the vote accurately, and people must\n<em>believe</em> they count the vote accurately. The second requirement\nis distinct from and just as important as the first. Likewise with\nnewspapers. We must be accurate, and we must be believed to be\naccurate. It’s a bitter pill to swallow, but we are failing on the\nsecond requirement. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an\nelection. No undecided voters in Pennsylvania are going to say,\n“I’m going with Newspaper A’s endorsement.” None. What\npresidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of\nbias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a\nprincipled decision, and it’s the right one. Eugene Meyer,\npublisher of The Washington Post from 1933 to 1946, thought the\nsame, and he was right. By itself, declining to endorse\npresidential candidates is not enough to move us very far up the\ntrust scale, but it’s a meaningful step in the right direction. I\nwish we had made the change earlier than we did, in a moment\nfurther from the election and the emotions around it. That was\ninadequate planning, and not some intentional strategy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bezos has always been a good writer, and this piece is no exception. But deciding to change the Post’s policy on election endorsements <em>12 days</em> before any election, let alone <em>this</em> election, is not “inadequate planning”. Changing the policy, say, this summer, before the Republican National Convention, would be “inadequate planning”. Now though? No.</p>\n\n<p>And how does any of this square with the fact that The Washington Post has an entire editorial and opinion section, that runs bylined opinion columns and commentary from the editorial board every day? You know, the section where this very column by Bezos ran?</p>\n\n<p>As regards trust: declining to endorse a candidate won’t “tip the scales” an iota for Trump supporters who view The Washington Post as “fake news”. All it has done is wipe out large amounts of trust among readers who do — or at least until last week <em>did</em> — put their faith in the publication.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href=\"https://fosstodon.org/@drdrang/113387991801308851\">Dr. Drang</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If I’m following Bezos’s logic, he must not just run the Post\nwithout letting his other business interests interfere, he must\n<em>appear</em> to run the Post without letting his other business\ninterests interfere. The easy way to do that would be to keep his\nhands off the editorial board. I wonder why that didn’t occur to\nhim? (No, I don’t really wonder.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I wish I’d thought to make that point — <em>Bezos’s own analogy</em> shows how calamitous a decision this was to block an endorsement less than two weeks away from the election.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/28/bezos-trust\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b55b72b0087656182856657a506d54786fb7751721310913c85d3918cca0eebd","category":"Tech"}
