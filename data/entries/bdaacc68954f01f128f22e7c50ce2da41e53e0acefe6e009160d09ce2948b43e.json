That’s where the new T-Way from Abbey Bike Tools comes in. No stranger to elevating the common bike tool (like their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ib17-abbey-bike-tools-four-way-fixes-three-way/\" target=\"_blank\">4-Way wrench</a>), the T-Way is Abbey’s take on the common T-Handle wrench in their typical obsessively precise way. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench1-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Abbey T-way knurling options\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench1-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench1.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Crafted from the same stainless steel used for their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/abbey-bike-tools-celebrates-10-years-with-10th-anniversary-titanium-tool-kit/\" target=\"_blank\">Crombie tool</a> heads, the T-Way is designed to be more robust than the 4-Way for constant shop or traveling mechanic use. When we first saw the tools at Sea Otter, Abbey was still trying to decide on the final knurling pattern for the grip. According to their post on facebook, the final decision was inspired by feedback from John Hall, going with one of the finer patterns. Initially it feels smooth to the touch, but it’s surprising grippy when you put pressure on it. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sa7fTdjk_1024x1024.jpg-e1686319207336.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"497\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sa7fTdjk_1024x1024.jpg-e1686319207336.webp\" alt=\"production Abbey T-Way\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sa7fTdjk_1024x1024.jpg-e1686319207336.webp 497w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sa7fTdjk_1024x1024.jpg-e1686319207336-297x235.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sa7fTdjk_1024x1024.jpg-e1686319207336-120x95.webp 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tools on display at the show were part of a collaboration with SRAM, hence the red accent at the top. The production tools will carry the classic Abbey Tool green shown above. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to the actual configuration of the bits, you have a few options. Two stock bit configurations will be offered with either 4, 5 &amp; T25 or 5, 6, &amp; T25 bits glued in place for $60. A third option gives you the choice of 3 custom bit choices, also glued in for $65. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench6.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench6-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Abbey Bit set\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench6-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench6-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench6-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench6-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench6-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench6.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench5-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Abbey Bit holder magnet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench5-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench5-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench5-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench5-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abbey-Bike-Tools-T-Handle-T-Way-wrench5.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you can order the tool with 10 bits and magnetic sockets so you can swap the bits as you please. The bit holder is also magnetic so you can mount it to your work stand, bench, etc. This option increases the price to $120. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first batch of tools is already sold out, but Abbey is taking pre-orders for the second batch which will start shipping in July. Based on the first round, these will probably go quick. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.abbeybiketools.com/collections/tools/products/t-way?variant=40815132672048\" target=\"_blank\">abbeybiketools.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/abbey-bike-tools-t-way-multi-tool/\">Abbey Bike Tools T-Way is Part T-Handle, Part 3-Way</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"bdaacc68954f01f128f22e7c50ce2da41e53e0acefe6e009160d09ce2948b43e","category":"Cycling"}
