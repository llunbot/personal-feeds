Such groups can cause redundant clutter in the app and become a distraction to members if others in the group are still in conversation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhatsApp is clearly aware of the problem, as indicated by another beta discovery courtesy of <a href=\"https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-ios-23-5-0-71-whats-new/\">WABetaInfo</a>. A new \"Expiring Groups\" setting will let users set a specific expiration date for their WhatsApp groups. \"When enabled, you will be prompted to clean up groups on their expiration date,\" reads the explanatory text for the UI option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"When this feature is released, users will be able to choose from various expiration options such as one day, one week, or a custom date, and they will also have the ability to remove an expiration that was previously set in case they change their mind,\" explains WABetaInfo, who adds that the option is for individuals, \"as it will not apply to other group participants.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe feature appears in a version 23.5.0.71 submitted by WhatsApp developers through the TestFlight Beta Program. It's not clear when it will be ready to go live, but the fact that it is in active development is likely to come as welcome news to users with lots of group memberships.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeanwhile, another feature WhatsApp is reportedly working on may help users avoid spam calls on the platform. <a href=\"https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-working-on-a-feature-to-mute-calls-from-unknown-numbers/\">According to WABetaInfo</a>, the feature will offer the ability to silence calls from unknown numbers, although silenced calls will still be visible in the Notification Center and the calls list.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe latter feature is being developed in response to a problem introduced by WhatsApp's Communities feature, which has reportedly opened up numbers to random calls and group chat invites from unknown users.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/\">WhatsApp</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/08/whatsapp-expiring-groups-feature-test/\">WhatsApp Testing 'Expiring Groups' Feature to Easily Leave Redundant Chats</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-testing-expiring-groups-feature-to-easily-leave-redundant-chats.2383077/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a8729b7d2e84575029c7f26bfa55a0485ad37ffd9e489be04a37304088c9dcb3","category":"Apple"}
