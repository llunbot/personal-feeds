As part of the deal, Apple offers an incentive with purchases of qualifying Apple products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s ‘Back to School’ deal runs in various locations around the world during the summer months. The deal usually ends about a month after the first university semester begins in that country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple started its Higher Education Offer in <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-673191-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/au-hed/shop/back-to-school\" target=\"_blank\">Australia</a> and <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-673191-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/nz-hed/shop/back-to-school\" target=\"_blank\">New Zealand</a> on January 4, 2024. This deal will run until March 13, 2024. This year the company is giving away vouchers rather than AirPods, which was the giveaway in those countries in 2023.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deal is also running in <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-673191-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/br-hed/shop/back-to-school\" target=\"_blank\">Brazil</a> and <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-673191-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/kr-k12/shop/back-to-school\" target=\"_blank\">South Korea</a> where, instead of vouchers, Apple is giving away AirPods or the Apple Pencil with certain purchases. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is likely that, when the deal starts up in the Northern Hemisphere later in the year, Apple will again give vouchers away with select product sales. Read on to find out when the Higher Education Deal will start where you live. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what you need to know about Apple’s education offering including what the deal includes, how to take advantage of Apple’s education deal, and when it will run again. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is Apple’s Back To School offer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For a long time, Apple gave away a pair of AirPods with qualifying sales as part of its education promotion, but in the summers of 2022 and 2023 (at least in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and Europe) Apple didn’t give away AirPods to students. Instead, Apple offered gift cards with qualifying purchases. Students get different gift card denominations depending on the products purchased. Not all Apple products are included in the offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means those taking advantage of the deal get more choice about what they spend their money on, rather than being limited to headphones. Apple also offers gift cards during its <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672787/apple-black-friday.html\">Black Friday shopping event</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple didn’t offer vouchers everywhere though. When Apple kicked off its student deal in Australia, New Zealand, and other Southern Hemisphere locations in January 2023, students in those countries were again able to choose a free pair of AirPods with their qualifying purchase. For 2024 the deal is vouchers again, which can, of course, be exchanged for AirPods. However, those based in Brazil can claim free AirPods with a Mac or free Apple Pencil with their iPad purchase. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t the only education-related saving Apple offers though.  Apple doesn’t only offer education-related deals during the summer months. All products sold to students via Apple’s Education Store include a discount all year round, so you can always make a saving on any of these products, as long as you qualify. The summertime education-focused deal is in addition to these year-long discounts Apple offers to students and education institutions on its Macs and iPads. We explain everything you need to know about getting a discount, including how much you can save as a student, and explain how to use Apple’s Education Store in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670705/how-to-get-an-apple-student-discount-at-apples-education-store.html\">Guide to shopping in the Apple Education Store.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have advice about the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670477/best-mac-or-macbook-for-students.html\">Best Mac for Students</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668914/best-ipad-for-students.html\">Best iPad for Students</a>.
