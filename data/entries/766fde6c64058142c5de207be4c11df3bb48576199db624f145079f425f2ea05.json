I also love bringing stuff on my bike rides, which is much easier when you have one or the other, and even better with <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-tunitas-carryall-basket-tote-137-a-grab-and-go-tote/\" target=\"_blank\">both</a> at the same time. One of my favorite bike bag companies is women-owned <a href=\"https://www.pocampo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Po Campo</a>. This year, they’ve launched a new bag called the <a href=\"https://www.pocampo.com/products/pinellas-bike-basket\" target=\"_blank\">Pinellas Bike Bag</a>. It’s a stout bag with a unique quick-release system. And if you wanted to bring your furry best friend along with you on your ride, the Pinellas is your new bag!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may remember that last year, I awarded the Po Campo Cresent Bag my “<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sea-otter-best-of-show-award-2024-bikerumor/\" target=\"_blank\">Best of Show</a>” for the 2024 Sea Otter Classic. This year, another bag has caught my eye as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-inside-pocket.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-inside-pocket.webp\" alt=\"SOC Po Campo Pinellas Bike Bag inside pocket\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-inside-pocket.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-inside-pocket-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-inside-pocket-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-inside-pocket-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Internal pocket (Photos / R. Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pinellas Bike Bag is packed with some really cool features. It comes in two colors, Meadow and Waves. The bag has a 25-liter capacity, and with the shoulder strap, it can double as an “off the bike” bag for carrying groceries or snacks for the park.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bring Your Dog for the Ride</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-Klickfix-bar.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-Klickfix-bar.webp\" alt=\"SOC Po Campo Pinellas Bike Bag Klickfix bar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-Klickfix-bar.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-Klickfix-bar-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-Klickfix-bar-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-Klickfix-bar-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With the bag’s large capacity (25L), it’s large enough to bring your dog with you (as long as he/she is under 15 lbs). With the included Klickfix handlebar adaptor, the bag remains stable, even while riding on rough terrain. Also included is Po Campo’s Safe Tether System to keep your pup in place while in the basket.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-Safe-Tether-System.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-Safe-Tether-System.webp\" alt=\"SOC Po Campo Pinellas Bike Bag Safe Tether System\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-Safe-Tether-System.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-Safe-Tether-System-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-Safe-Tether-System-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-Safe-Tether-System-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Po Campo’s Safe Tether System is designed to keep dogs safe while riding in a front basket. It includes two D-ring leashes that clip right to your dog’s harness. It can be adjusted from a max length of 11″ down to the minimum length of 6.5″.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s it Come With?</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>1x Pinellas fabric basket</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1x KLICKfix handlebar adapter</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1x Moovaring metal ring for basket structure</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2x Side stiffeners to help keep bag open</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1x Shoulder strap – max length: 60”, min length: 31”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Safe Tether System<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" /> – two D-ring leashes to clip to dog harness (max length: 11”, min Length: 6.5”)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-Klickfix-mount.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-Klickfix-mount.webp\" alt=\"SOC Po Campo Pinellas Bike Bag Klickfix mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-Klickfix-mount.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-Klickfix-mount-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-Klickfix-mount-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Po-Campo-Pinellas-Bike-Bag-Klickfix-mount-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pinella Bike Bag Retail, Detail &amp; Dimensions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $128</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dimensions: W15” x H10” x D11”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Volume: 25L</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weight: 2lb 3oz</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Water Resistance: Coated fabrics and covered zippers</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nighttime Visibility: Reflective accents for extra visibility in low light conditions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pockets: Internal Pocket: (8.5″ W x 7.5″ H) and two exterior pockets (5.5″ W x 6″ H)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Straps: Max length 60″, minimum length 31″</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out all of the awesome, well-made, bike goodies at the link below!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.pocampo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PoCampo.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/po-campo-pinellas-bike-basket-for-small-dogs/\">Small Dogs Ride Like E.T. with the New Po Campo Pinellas Bike Basket</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"766fde6c64058142c5de207be4c11df3bb48576199db624f145079f425f2ea05","category":"Cycling"}
