A rigid steel singlespeed mountain bike with an extra reinforcing tube in the front triangle. It’s a blast to ride, but a hard sell vs. a proper trail hardtail. Hard to justify keeping in their regular line-up, too. So, Sour decided to go limited edition. Ultra-limited. Just 10 bikes will be made and go on sale today!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sour Bad Granny steel-everything limited edition MTB klunker</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sour-Bad-Granny-Raw-LTD_steel-everything-limited-edition-retro-modern-mountain-bike-klunker_front.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sour-Bad-Granny-Raw-LTD_steel-everything-limited-edition-retro-modern-mountain-bike-klunker_front.jpg\" alt=\"Sour Bad Granny Raw Ltd. steel-everything limited edition retro modern mountain bike klunker, made-in-Germany, frontend\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sour-Bad-Granny-Raw-LTD_steel-everything-limited-edition-retro-modern-mountain-bike-klunker_front.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sour-Bad-Granny-Raw-LTD_steel-everything-limited-edition-retro-modern-mountain-bike-klunker_front-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sour-Bad-Granny-Raw-LTD_steel-everything-limited-edition-retro-modern-mountain-bike-klunker_front-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sour-Bad-Granny-Raw-LTD_steel-everything-limited-edition-retro-modern-mountain-bike-klunker_front-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sour-Bad-Granny-Raw-LTD_steel-everything-limited-edition-retro-modern-mountain-bike-klunker_front-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sour-Bad-Granny-Raw-LTD_steel-everything-limited-edition-retro-modern-mountain-bike-klunker_front-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sour-Bad-Granny-Raw-LTD_steel-everything-limited-edition-retro-modern-mountain-bike-klunker_front-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Sour)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, Sour decided to go all in on building their klunker mountain bike into something unique.
