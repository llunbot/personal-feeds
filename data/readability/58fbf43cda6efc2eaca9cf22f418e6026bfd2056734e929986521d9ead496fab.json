During autumn and winter it’s always either sunny and cold or rainy and relatively warm. Trails can be really muddy here, but we have a lot to pick from: gravel, dirt roads, singletracks and even some paved stuff 😉 So you can always find a route that works for an effective bike therapy. Didn’t even touch my energy bars today since I could always pick some apples along the way.”</p><p>We always love seeing photos from where you are riding and are happy to share them with our readers around&nbsp;the world here on the Pic Of The Day.
