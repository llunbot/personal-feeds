We decided to put these chatbots through their paces with an assortment of tasks to determine which one reigns supreme in the AI chatbot arena. Since Bing Chat uses similar <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-announces-gpt-4-its-next-generation-ai-language-model/\">GPT-4</a> technology as the latest ChatGPT model, we opted to focus on two titans of AI chatbot technology: OpenAI and Google.</p>\n\n<p>We tested ChatGPT and Bard in seven critical categories: dad jokes, argument dialog, mathematical word problems, summarization, factual retrieval, creative writing, and coding. For each test, we fed the exact same instruction (called a \"prompt\") into ChatGPT (with GPT-4) and Google Bard. We used the first result, with no cherry-picking.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that a version of ChatGPT based on the earlier <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/11/openai-conquers-rhyming-poetry-with-new-gpt-3-update/\">GPT-3.5</a> model is also available, but we did not use that in the test. Since we used GPT-4 only, we will refer to ChatGPT as \"ChatGPT-4\" in this article to reduce confusion.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928609#p3\">Read 45 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928609&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"072ba038e14e3699636808a354e13104107b8157a36a32503845267e92c6ad8e","category":"Tech"}
