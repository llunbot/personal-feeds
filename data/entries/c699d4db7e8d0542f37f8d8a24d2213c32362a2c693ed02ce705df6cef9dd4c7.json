I get why the spaceship image is foggy and grainy, but why does the prompt of a house with flowers look like a washed out image from a horror movie?

The OS is shipping to supported Pixel devices now, which means the Pixel 4a (5G) and every variant of the Pixel 5, 6, and 7, plus the Fold and Tablet.</p>\n<p>The big feature this year is a somewhat customizable home screen. You can pick from several different lock screen clock styles and customize the two bottom app shortcuts. This feels like a response to iOS 16's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/ios-16-review-customization-unlocked/#h1\">lock screen widgets</a> (a feature Android <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/10/building-android-a-40000-word-history-of-googles-mobile-os/22/\">used to have</a> back in the 4.2 days) but not nearly as customizable. It's honestly hard to highlight a second Android 14 feature because this is one of the smallest Android releases ever.</p>\n<p>The first feature Google mentions in its blog post is a new wallpaper picker. On the Pixel 8, Android now has a built-in text-to-image AI wallpaper maker, presumably a feature that lets the Android team adhere to Google's \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/05/google-at-i-o-2023-weve-been-doing-ai-since-before-it-was-cool/\">mandatory AI</a>\" company mandate. There's also a new monochrome theme if you're tired of all those \"Material You\" colors.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973123#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973123&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c699d4db7e8d0542f37f8d8a24d2213c32362a2c693ed02ce705df6cef9dd4c7","category":"Tech"}
