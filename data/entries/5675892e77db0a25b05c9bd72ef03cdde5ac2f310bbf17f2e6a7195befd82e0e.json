Apple releases new Apple Watch models (called “series”) on a yearly cadence, and the price rarely changes by all that much. So to avoid buying an Apple Watch that is outdated after just a few weeks, you want to time it right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has just announced the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157474/new-apple-watch-2024-release-date.html\">Apple Watch Series 10</a>, so this is a good time to buy. If you’re in the market for a new Apple Watch, see our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671574/best-apple-watch.html\">Apple Watch buying guide</a>, and our round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672795/best-apple-watch-deals.html\">best Apple Watch deals</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what we know about Apple Watch release dates and when you should or should not buy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should I buy a new Apple Watch right now?</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Our advice is to buy an Apple Watch Series 10 now, unless you want to wait for a new Apple Watch SE or Apple Watch Ultra, which could be updated in 2025.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple announced the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2451831/apple-watch-series-10-display-health-feautures-ultra-satin-black-milanese-loop.html\">Apple Watch Series 10</a> at an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">event in September</a> 2024. The Apple Watch Series 10 is thinner and slightly larger with a bigger display and faster charging. Apple also introduced a new color option for the Apple Watch Ultra 2, but other than that the second-gen Ultra hasn’t changed since its launch in 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2024 Apple Watches went up for preorder after Apple’s September 9 event, and will go on sale on September 20, 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple tends to update the Apple Watch yearly, so once the new models launch in September, you probably won’t see another upgrade until September of the following year. Therefore as long as you aren’t shopping in July or August, it is a good time to buy a new Apple Watch. </p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Apple Watch Series 10</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-screen.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Apple Watch Series 10\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-screen.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1920w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-screen.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-screen.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-screen.png?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-screen.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-screen.png?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-screen.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$399\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch\" target=\"_blank\">399 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>However, Apple did not introduce a new Apple Watch SE as expected, so there is a possibility that it will be introduced in the spring of 2025. If it’s a new SE you want then you may want to wait to see if the third-generation model launches in 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering the SE because it is the cheaper option, you may want to consider another way to get a discounted Apple Watch. When Apple introduces the new Apple Watch models it usually discontinues older models. When Apple discontinues the older models and introduces the new ones the price of the older models, if you can find them available from a third-party store, usually goes down. So following the introduction of new Apple Watches you may be able to get a good deal on an older Apple Watch.

If you buy a new Apple Watch in August expect to be kicking yourself a month later when the new model arrives and resellers start to discount the older model to sell it off at a lower price. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best time to buy an Apple Watch isn’t necessarily when a new model launches. If you wait a month or two you might be able to take advantages of sales and price drops from resellers. During October and November we see lots of sales events, such as Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday, and you can expect to get some money off at these events. Apple doesn’t discount its products at its own stores, but it does offer vouchers with new purchases from time to time–and Black Friday is one of those times. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When does Apple update the Apple Watch?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple usually updates the Apple Watch at an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple Event in September</a>. In 2024, it introduces the Series 10 and a new color for the year-old Ultra 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, not every Apple Watch gets updated every year. The Apple Watch SE can go two or more years between updates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more advice read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671574/best-apple-watch.html\">Apple Watch buying guide</a>. </p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5675892e77db0a25b05c9bd72ef03cdde5ac2f310bbf17f2e6a7195befd82e0e","category":"Apple"}
