{"title":"2024: The year AI drove everyone crazy","link":"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/2024-the-year-ai-drove-everyone-crazy/","date":1735214425000,"content":"<p>It's been a wild year in tech thanks to the intersection between humans and artificial intelligence. 2024 brought a parade of AI oddities, mishaps, and wacky moments that inspired odd behavior from both machines and man. From AI-generated rat genitals to search engines telling people to eat rocks, this year proved that AI has been having a weird impact on the world.</p>\n<p>Why the weirdness? If we had to guess, it may be due to the novelty of it all. Generative AI and applications built upon <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/chatgpts-success-could-have-come-sooner-says-former-google-ai-researcher/\">Transformer-based</a> AI models are still so new that people are throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. People have been struggling to grasp both the implications and potential applications of the new technology. Riding along with the hype, different types of AI that may end up being ill-advised, such as automated military targeting systems, have also been introduced.</p>\n<p>It's worth mentioning that aside from crazy news, we saw fewer weird AI advances in 2024 as well. For example, Claude 3.5 Sonnet <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/anthropics-latest-best-ai-model-is-twice-as-fast-and-still-terrible-at-dad-jokes/\">launched in June</a> held off the competition as a top model for most of the year, while <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/\">OpenAI's o1</a> used runtime compute to expand GPT-4o's capabilities with simulated reasoning. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/talking-to-chatgpt-for-the-first-time-is-a-surreal-experience/\">Advanced Voice Mode</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/fake-ai-podcasters-are-reviewing-my-book-and-its-freaking-me-out/\">NotebookLM</a> also emerged as novel applications of AI tech, and the year saw the rise of more capable <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/new-ai-music-generator-udio-synthesizes-realistic-music-on-demand/\">music synthesis models</a> and also better <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/is-china-pulling-ahead-in-ai-video-synthesis-we-put-minimax-to-the-test/\">AI video generators</a>, including several from China.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/2024-the-year-ai-drove-everyone-crazy/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/2024-the-year-ai-drove-everyone-crazy/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"302940b5a0b1fcd644b2ee7a359e1d2f84552593c83adfe5df2980bdeecf01d5","category":"Tech"}
