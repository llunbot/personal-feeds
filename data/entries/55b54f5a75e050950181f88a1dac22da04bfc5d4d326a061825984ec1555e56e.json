But the precise mechanisms by which kitties produce those pleasant, low-frequency rumblings has been a matter of some debate among scientists. Now a team of Austrian scientists has determined that connective tissues embedded in cats' vocal cords play a crucial role in this ability, according to a <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)01230-7\">new paper</a> published in the journal Current Biology. The authors argue that their findings call for a reassessment of the current prevailing hypothesis about how cats purr.</p>\n<p>Purring is mostly exclusive to cats, although certain other species can produce purr-like sounds, including raccoons, mongooses, kangaroos, badgers, rabbits, and guinea pigs. And cats are <a href=\"https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1096-3642.1835.tb00611.x\">usually divided</a> into those that purr (<em>Felinae</em>) and those that roar (<em>Pantherinae</em>); no cat species can do both. The latter category includes lions, tigers, jaguars, and leopards, and scientists <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1570911/\">have suggested</a> that the roaring capability is due to an incompletely ossified hyoid bone in the larynx. \"Purrers,\" by contrast, have a completely ossified hyoid, although the purring snow leopard is a rare exception.</p>\n<p>We know the <a href=\"http://roberteklund.info/pdf/Eklund_Peters_Duthie_2010=Purring_Cheetah_DomesticCat.pdf\">fundamental frequency</a> at which <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1469-7998.1991.tb04749.x\">cats purr</a>—between 20 to 30 vibrations per second, although purrs can go up to about 150 Hz—but that is lower than expected based on vocal cord anatomy. As a general rule, larger animals have longer vocal cords and thus create lower-frequency sounds. But cats are relatively small, typically weighing on the order of a few kilograms, and their vocal cords are also relatively short. Hence the curiosity about how they produce such low-frequency purrs.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973511#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973511&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"55b54f5a75e050950181f88a1dac22da04bfc5d4d326a061825984ec1555e56e","category":"Tech"}
