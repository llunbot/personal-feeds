Apple Confirms the M4 Max Chip Lacks UltraFusion","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-confirms-m4-max-lacks-ultrafusion/","date":1741193169000,"content":"A spokesperson for Apple has <a href=\"https://www.numerama.com/tech/1919213-m4-max-et-m3-ultra-letrange-choix-dapple-avec-le-mac-studio.html\">told French technology website <em>Numerama</em></a> that its M4 Max chip lacks an UltraFusion connector, which would have paved the way for the release of a doubled-up M4 Ultra chip in the future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-M4-Pro-vs-M4-Max-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nAs we <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-explains-lack-of-m4-ultra-chip/\">recently covered</a>, Apple told <em>Ars Technica</em> that not every generation of M-series chips for Macs will include an \"Ultra\" chip. That seems like Apple indirectly confirming that it has no plans to release an M4 Ultra chip, and the M4 Max's lack of UltraFusion technology makes it even more likely there won't be an M4 Ultra chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple could still design an M4 Ultra chip from scratch, but it seems to have downplayed this possibility, according to the <em>Numerama</em> report.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/new-mac-studio-with-m4-max-and-m3-ultra/\">new Mac Studio announced today</a> is available with M4 Max and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-introduces-m3-ultra-chip/\">M3 Ultra chip</a> options, with no M4 Ultra chip offered. Apple says the M3 Ultra chip is essentially two M3 Max chips fused together with its UltraFusion technology, so the chip's specs are all doubled compared to the M3 Max. There was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/m3-max-chip-hidden-change/\">speculation last year</a> about the M3 Max chip lacking UltraFusion technology, but Apple's announcement today has proven that rumor was false.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn summary, the M3 Max chip has an UltraFusion connector, but the M4 Max chip does not.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe M3 Ultra chip features up to a 32-core CPU, up to an 80-core GPU, a 32-core Neural Engine, and support for up to 512GB of unified RAM. Apple says the M3 Ultra chip is up to 1.5x faster than the M2 Ultra chip, and up to 1.8x faster than the M1 Ultra chip.
