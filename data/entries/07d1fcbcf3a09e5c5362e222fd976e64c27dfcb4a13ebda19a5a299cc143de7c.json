{"title":"The iPhone 17 Air rumors are a smack in the face for iPhone mini lovers","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2533484/the-iphone-mini-missed-opportunity.html","date":1732617000000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, the Macalope is still talking about the iPhone mini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, <em>you</em> stop hitting yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like a man continually trying to run the 100-meter hurdles with his hand handcuffed to his ankle, the horny one is going to go at it again and argue Apple went about making a small iPhone wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone needs a hobby.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent iPhone sales estimates would appear to put the kibosh on any thoughts that some people actually wanted smaller iPhones. That is until you fold up these numbers, cut them into a snowflake, and then hold them up to the light to divine the true meaning of Christmas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upshot of <a href=\"https://cirpapple.substack.com/p/iphone-shapes-and-sizes\">CIRP’s latest iPhone model share estimates</a> is that the share that was taken by the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 13 mini appears to have gone to larger phones. Of course, that’s not likely how that occurred. It wasn’t like little phone lovers suddenly decided they were wrong and bought the biggest phone they could get their tiny hands on. The Macalope had both minis and went with the smallest new iPhone he could get this year: the iPhone 16. (There’s just so long you can hold out.) It’s simply that more people who had bought the smaller iPhones bought bigger ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing is certainly true: if you don’t make a small iPhone, no one is going to buy one. But like <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089791/quotes/?item=qt0339769&amp;ref_=ext_shr_lnk\">everyone Pee Wee Herman knew</a>, the Macalope has a big “but”. And that is what we will never know is how well an iPhone mini with a top-of-the-line processor and camera would have sold. The Macalope didn’t buy the iPhone mini (twice) because it was cheaper. He bought it because it was smaller. Apple never made the mini he actually wanted.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macalope-2021.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Macalope\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macalope-2021.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macalope-2021.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macalope-2021.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macalope-2021.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macalope-2021.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macalope-2021.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, as far as boats that have set sail go, this one is long gone. Out of the harbor, across the ocean, and over the edge of the world kind of sailed. Argonauts just tumbling off of it as it falls forever. At this point, it is beyond futile to argue in favor of a smaller iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, that’s not going to stop the Macalope, of course. He’s probably going to keep talking about the iPhone mini until the heat death of the universe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point is, it’s likely some people are turning to larger phones for reasons other than the screen size, such as longer battery life and a larger starting capacity. Most surely do want the bigger screens, but probably not everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, look, if we can’t have small, how about thin?: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2533217/iphone-17-air-design-revealed-5-6mm-aluminum-case-single-camera-more.html\">iPhone 17 Air design revealed: 5-6mm aluminum case, single camera, more</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may find out what people really want when Apple ships the iPhone Air next year. The screen size will be in between the iPhone Pro and iPhone Pro Max at 6.6 inches, but Apple will apparently grease the skids for the new device by not shipping an iPhone 17 Plus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh. Must be nice to be Apple’s favorite. The Macalope wonders how well the iPhone minis would have sold if Apple hadn’t shipped the base iPhone 12 and 13. <em>Guess we’ll never know.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the screen size will fit nicely for iPhone Plus fans at just 0.1 inch smaller, one thing might not. Unsurprisingly, the device will also have a “smaller battery” than current iPhones, but it remains to be seen how battery life ultimately compares. If the battery life is equivalent to that of an imaginary iPhone 17 mini, will customers still go for the thinnovation? Guess we’ll see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Macalope’s not at all rooting for the iPhone 17 Air to fail. If anything he likes seeing Apple trying new form factors. Speaking of which, here’s a new form factor for you Apple: the iPhone Pro mini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just a thought.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"07d1fcbcf3a09e5c5362e222fd976e64c27dfcb4a13ebda19a5a299cc143de7c","category":"Apple"}
