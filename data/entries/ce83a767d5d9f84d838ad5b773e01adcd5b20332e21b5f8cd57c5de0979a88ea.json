{"title":"Where Are the Bluesky Clients?","link":"https://parker.micro.blog/2025/01/29/where-are-the-bluesky-clients.html","date":1738529530000,"content":"\n<p>Parker Ortolani:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Mastodon clients have become the new UI playground in the same way\nthat Twitter clients used to be. But what I can’t wrap my head\naround is the business decision of developers to lean into\nMastodon clients versus Bluesky ones. Fortunately some progress\nseems to be starting to be made with apps like <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id6740792786\">PinkSky</a>\nthat replicate the Instagram experience but using Bluesky as the\nbackend. There are also a handful of clients like <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id6466340923\">Skeets</a>\nand <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/graysky-a-bluesky-client/id6448234181\">GraySky</a>, but nothing that approaches the quality of\nsome Mastodon clients or the legendary Twitter clients of old.\nThey’re okay, but they’re not worth dropping the official client.\nOther apps like <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1666230916\">OpenVibe</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id6475002485\">Reeder</a> are designed\nto combine feeds from multiple services and they do work with\nBluesky. But they’re not dedicated clients. I want Tweetbot or\nTwitterrific, but for Bluesky. I’m not seeing that yet. The\nopportunity is clearly there, it has tens of millions of users\nmaking it three times the size of Mastodon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One thing all the existing nascent Bluesky clients lack is timeline position saving/sync — so when you leave the app and come back later (with sync, even on a different device) you can pick up reading exactly where you left off. I find it hard to imagine paying for a Bluesky client that didn’t do this.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/02/where-are-the-bluesky-clients\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ce83a767d5d9f84d838ad5b773e01adcd5b20332e21b5f8cd57c5de0979a88ea","category":"Tech"}
