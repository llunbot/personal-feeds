When iOS 15 lands later this year, users will be given the option to update to the latest version of iOS or to stick with iOS 14 and simply install the latest security fixes.</p>\n\n<p>“iOS now offers a choice between two software update versions in the Settings app,” Apple explains (<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-wont-make-you-upgrade-to-ios-15/\">via MacRumors</a>). “You can update to the latest version of iOS 15 as soon as it’s released for the latest features and most complete set of security updates. Or continue on ‌iOS 14‌ and still get important security updates until you’re ready to upgrade to the next major version.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I missed this news last month, and misspoke about it on [the latest episode of my podcast][tts318], while talking about holding onto iOS 14 indefinitely if Apple doesn’t sufficiently improve the design for Safari in iOS 15.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/23/ios-14-security-updates\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"46c94d23e64dc8ffa7c7980cd7e4a19af6b474a6492ea8b6aa4aad119b6ed324","category":"Tech"}
