It features the same Reflex mode as seen on the Six Pack, and includes four XP-L2 LEDs to  produce a maximum 4,000 lumens in Reflex mode.</p>\n<p>The MaXx D doesn’t come cheap, but its power and technology gained it four stars.

Its five modes and three power settings allow you to dial down the power for more urban settings and daytime riding.</p>\n<p>Our tester could barely fault it, awarding the Ion RT four and a half stars in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/accessories/lights/front-light/bontrager-ion-pro-rt-front-light-review/\">our review.</a></p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.tritoncycles.co.uk/accessories-c11/lights-c144/ion-pro-rt-front-bike-light-p21307\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the Bontrager Ion RT with a 24% saving from Triton Cycles</a></li>\n</ul><h3><strong>Lezyne Hecto Drive 500XL — £45 £29.99 (save 33%)</strong></h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Lezyne Hecto Drive 500XL is a portable light for short, urban rides.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Lezyne</i></span></div>\n<p>The Lezyne Hecto Drive XL’s 500 lumens is enough for a decent pace on unlit bike paths, though with only one hour of run time at max output, the Hecto is best for use as an urban light.</p>\n<p>It charges quickly, stays in the mode you last used it in (surprisingly handy) and offers a total of eight flashing and constant modes, with claimed run times of between one hour and 20 hours.</p>\n<p>The Lezyne Hecto Drive 500XL would come in handy as a backup light, especially now with a third cut off the price. Wiggle’s Black Friday deal is the cheapest we’ve come across.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?id=489797&amp;clickref=bikeradar-0&amp;awinmid=1857&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiggle.co.uk%2Flezyne-hecto-drive-500xl-front-light\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the Lezyne Hecto Drive 500XL with a 33% saving from Wiggle</a></li>\n</ul><section><div>\n        <h2>Which retailers and brands have launched Black Friday sales?</h2>\n<p>Black Friday is nearly here!

This year, it takes place on Friday 26 November, just a month before Christmas.</p>\n<p>It’s also directly followed by Cyber Monday on 29 November, but over the last few years we’ve seen retailers start their deals weeks in advance. Amazon Prime Day is an excellent example of this, taking place over a 48-hour period on 13 and 14 November.</p>\n<p>Fewer people will be wanting to hit the shops last-minute this year, so brands are likely to take advantage of this and share their best offers online rather than in-store.</p>\n<p>Whether bike lights are on your wishlist or you know a cycling enthusiast who needs some, you’ll find the best bike light Black Friday deals right here.</p>\n<h2>Are bike light deals on Black Friday worth waiting for?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> We’ll be shining a light on the best Black Friday cycling deals this week.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Last year, we saw huge reductions on bike light prices from brands including Light &amp; Motion, Guee, Exposure and Blackburn.</p>\n<p>And there were big opportunities not only to save on single bike lights, but also on sets.

Although the latest models might not automatically be on sale, this doesn’t mean you won’t find excellent models from previous ranges.</li>\n<li>Check out our top-rated favourites of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-lights-for-road-cycling/\">best bike lights</a>, tried and tested by the BikeRadar team.</li>\n</ul><h3>Should I wait for Cyber Monday?</h3>\n<p>It’s hard to predict what offers will take place, but don’t wait for Cyber Monday to hit.
