For a mountain bike priced around £500, you’ll generally want to be looking for a frame made of aluminium rather than heavier and cheaper steel. Steel can be a great material to make bikes from, but at this price point, it’s best avoided, generally speaking.</p>\n<p>The next thing you need to think about in your search for a budget mountain bike is the kit that makes it stop and go.</p>\n<p>The number of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/the-complete-guide-to-bicycle-gears-bicycle-transmissions-explained/\">gears</a> the bike has isn’t the be all and end all, but a higher number of gears often means smaller steps between shifts and a wider total range, which can be really important when you’re hauling up a big hill.</p>\n<p>At £500 or under, having nine gears at the back paired to a crank with three rings up front is ideal, but cheaper bikes may have just eight at the rear.</p>\n<p>Getting going is useless unless you can stop, and happily most bikes at this price now come with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-disc-brakes/\">disc brakes</a>, which offer much better, all-conditions performance than brakes that use the rim of the wheel to stop.</p>\n<p>Brakes that use hydraulic fluid rather than cables are a big plus too, because they require less maintenance and give more consistent stopping power.</p>\n<p>When it comes to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\">tyres</a>, it’s worth deciding how much time you’re likely to spend actually riding the bike off-road.</p>\n<p>If you just fancy a bike for getting to work or very occasional off-road use, but don’t fancy the look or riding position of a <a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/road/gear/article/best-road-bikes-under-1000-29719\">road bike</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hybrid-bikes/\">hybrid bike,</a> then a mountain bike is a good choice, but proper knobbly off-road tyres will make the going harder.</p>\n<p>It’s worth asking if the shop or dealer you’re buying from doesn’t mind switching the tyres to slicks or hybrid tyres, which have a mix of knobbly tread for cornering grip on the edge and a flatter centre for pedalling speed.</p>\n<p>Suspension forks are a big plus when it comes to control and comfort off-road, but because many forks can cost £500 (or double that) just on their own, the units fitted at this price can vary wildly in performance and longevity – as well as the adjustment control on offer. So pay particular attention to this.</p>\n<p>While it may seem like a downgrade, a rigid (non-suspension) fork can be a good choice on a lower-priced bike because the money saved can be used on other areas of the bike that may have a bigger impact on performance.</p>\n<h2>What should I avoid?</h2>\n<p>In mountain bikes under £500 it’s difficult (if not impossible) to get a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">full suspension</a> bike that’s any good.</p>\n<p>Quite simply, it’s going to be significantly heavier and it’s likely to offer very little advantage in comfort or control.</p>\n<p>In fact, quite the opposite, because many will lack any form of damping control – imagine riding a heavy pogo stick with wheels.</p>\n<p>Weight is an inevitable side-effect with budget mountain bikes, especially because mountain bikes need to be able to take a beating. Our reviews will list the weight and the effect it has, but cheaper bikes inevitably take a bit more effort to get up the hills than more expensive machines.</p>\n<p>It’s not all bad though, just think about how much fitter and faster you’ll be.</p>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"a4fe202dd7d9a1bd2f93964062ae80e151dd9d319aee4e220f9b37ac2bd65d0c","category":"Cycling"}
