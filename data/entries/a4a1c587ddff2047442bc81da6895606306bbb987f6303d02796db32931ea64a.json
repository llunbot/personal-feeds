The company will no longer use branding like Spectre and instead use Omni for all of its consumer-facing laptops, desktops, and all-in-ones (AIOs). Similarly, it will no longer refer to its commercial laptops as Dragonfly.</p>\n<p>HP announced today that it will no longer release computers under consumer PC series names like Pavilion. Instead, every consumer computer from HP will be called either an OmniBook for laptops, an OmniDesk for desktops, or an OmniStudio for AIOs. The computers will also have a modifier, ranging from 3 up to 5, 7, X, or Ultra to denote computers that are entry-level all the way up to advanced. For instance, an HP OmniBook Ultra would represent HP's highest-grade consumer laptop.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/consumer-e1716232534624.jpg\"><img alt=\"HP's new naming convention for consumer computers.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/consumer-e1716232534624-640x644.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/consumer-e1716232534624-1280x1287.jpg 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/consumer-e1716232534624.jpg\">HP's new naming convention for consumer computers.</a> (credit: HP)</p></div>\n<p>\"For example, an HP OmniBook 3 will appeal to customers who prioritize entertainment and personal use, while the OmniBook X will be designed for those with higher creative and technical demands,\" Stacy Wolff, SVP of design and sustainability at HP, said via a press announcement today.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025414#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025414&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a4a1c587ddff2047442bc81da6895606306bbb987f6303d02796db32931ea64a","category":"Tech"}
