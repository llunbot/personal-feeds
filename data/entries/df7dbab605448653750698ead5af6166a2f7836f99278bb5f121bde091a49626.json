Apple also said the iPhone 15 Pro's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-iphone-15-pro-overheating-details/\">titanium frame is not to blame</a>, so it appears that the overheating issues are not the result of hardware deficiencies.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe same bug fix should eventually be included in iOS 17.1, which is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-beta-2-to-developers/\">currently in beta</a> and is expected to be released in late October.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple added that the overheating issues were also related to some apps overloading the A17 Pro chip, including Instagram, Uber, and racing game Asphalt 9: Legends. Apple said it was working with the developers of these apps to address the situation. Instagram already released an app update with a fix on Wednesday. Uber also updated its app today, but whether it addresses this issue remains to be determined.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNot all iPhone 15 Pro users have experienced overheating, and it's unclear how many users have been impacted by the issue, but it should be fixed soon.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-preparing-ios-17-0-3/\">Apple Preparing iOS 17.0.3, Likely With Bug Fix for iPhone 15 Pro Overheating Issue</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-ios-17-0-3-likely-with-bug-fix-for-iphone-15-pro-overheating-issue.2406150/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"df7dbab605448653750698ead5af6166a2f7836f99278bb5f121bde091a49626","category":"Apple"}
