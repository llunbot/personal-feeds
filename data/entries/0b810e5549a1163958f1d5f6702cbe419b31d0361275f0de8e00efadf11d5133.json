Sure, he’s sponsored, and they’re making content around his rides, but at the core of all of it is just enjoying the experience.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p>His next big adventure is an attempt to race around the world and set a new record, and we talk about all of that and more before wrapping up with some advice for anyone looking to tackle their own ultra-distance or multi-day ride.
