The entry-level 14-inch model will have the M4, while higher end 14-inch models and 16-inch models will get the M4 Pro and M4 Max, which have not yet been unveiled. Apple first introduced the M4 in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> in May.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo redesign is expected, but Apple will overhaul the ‌Mac mini‌ that's expected to be refreshed alongside the MacBook Pro models. The ‌Mac mini‌ will feature a smaller footprint, and it will be Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/mac-mini-to-become-smallest-ever-apple-computer/\">smallest ever computer</a>. It could be around the size of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, though a little taller.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe M4 chip is built on TSMC's 3-nanometer process, much like the M3, but there are performance and efficiency improvements. Apple also included a new, more powerful Neural Engine for AI workloads.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and Apple Watch models planned for Apple's annual September event, new Macs could come out at a second event in October or November or they could be unveiled through a press release.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/09/when-to-expect-m4-macbook-air-mac-studio-mac-pro/\">also plans to refresh</a> the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a> with M4 chips, but those updates will not happen until 2025.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/15/m4-macbook-pro-panels-shipping/\">Display Panels for M4 MacBook Pro Shipping Ahead of Q4 Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/display-panels-for-m4-macbook-pro-shipping-ahead-of-q4-launch.2433715/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ee81f202577f9a1b549dc3fb41298dfd796b1fd15094ca925a8a6fcc9188affa","category":"Apple"}
