Rewatch set out to solve the problem of (seemingly endless) remote meetings taking time away from your real work. A <em>lot</em> of meetings could be skipped if there were quality notes. </p>\n\n<p>Rewatch fixes this by recording your Zoom, Google Meet, and Teams meetings and generating AI-powered recaps that catch you up in seconds via their web, iOS, and Android apps. Need to continue the conversation? Use Rewatch’s desktop screen recorder for Mac and Windows to share when a “quick sync” (that winds up never being all that quick) or meeting across time zones isn’t ideal.</p>\n\n<p>Get your time back. <a href=\"http://www.rewatch.com/resources/daring-fireball/?utm_source=daring-fireball&amp;utm_medium=sponsorship&amp;utm_campaign=daring-fireball-newsletter-q3-2023\">Try Rewatch for free today</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/20/rewatch\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f62a7da0ef86127c7a7b7da4b2f9262458e83bb9d023e877311a5b06a2607289","category":"Tech"}
