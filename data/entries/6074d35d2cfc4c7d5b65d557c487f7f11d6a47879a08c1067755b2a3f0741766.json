This marks <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/high-pressure-superconductors-reach-room-temperature/\">the second paper</a> the journal retracted over the objections of Ranga P. Dias, a faculty member at the University of Rochester who led the research. Or at least it's implied that he objected to this retraction, as he apparently refused to respond to Nature about the matter.</p>\n<p>Dias' work on superconductivity has focused on hydrogen-rich chemicals that form under extreme pressures. Other research groups have shown that the pressure forces hydrogen into crystals within the material, where it encourages the formation of electron pairs that enable superconductivity. This allows these chemicals to superconduct at elevated temperatures. Dias' two papers purportedly described one chemical that could superconduct at room temperatures and extreme pressures and a second that did so under somewhat lower pressures, putting it within reach of more readily available lab equipment.</p>\n<p>But problems with the first of these papers became apparent as the research community dug into the details of the work. Dias' team apparently used a non-standard method for calculating the background noise in a key experiment and didn't include the details of how this was done in the paper. In other words, the data in the paper looked good, but it wasn't clear whether it accurately reflected the experimental results. As a result, Nature retracted it, although all nine authors of the paper objected to this decision at the time.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982217#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982217&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6074d35d2cfc4c7d5b65d557c487f7f11d6a47879a08c1067755b2a3f0741766","category":"Tech"}
