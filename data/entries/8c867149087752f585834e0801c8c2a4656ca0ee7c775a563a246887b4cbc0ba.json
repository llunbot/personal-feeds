Chances are you’re familiar with the famous 180km sportive in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/lake-district-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Lake District</a>, with its savage, stabbing climbs, including <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cyclist-100-classic-climbs-10-4\" target=\"_blank\">the infamous 30% Hardknott Pass</a>. It’s sometimes referred to as the hardest one-day ride in the UK, and many of the tens of thousands of riders who’ve completed it over the years claim it’s the most brutal thing they’ve done on two wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, all 2,500 spaces go like hotcakes every year, and if you’re one of the brave few that managed to bag a spot for May 2023, you’re probably starting to think about anything that might make your day a bit less painful. From sweet-spot gearing to training tips, here are some key insights from those who’ve been there, done it and got the jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hit the hills</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Sounds obvious, but get used to riding up hills,’ says cycling YouTuber and Fred finisher <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZNGth8J1s0\" target=\"_blank\">David Arthur</a>. ‘I spent the months leading up to the event going out of my way to find the most horrible climbs I could. It wasn’t much fun, but it helped on the day. I’m fortunate enough to live in the hilly Cotswolds, but even if you’re not graced with local hills the indoor trainer lets you simulate serious gradients. I used the Alpe du Zwift on days when the weather was unkind.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Choose your kit carefully</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/07093847/uk_rides_lake_district_1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"uk_rides_lake_district_1\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/07093847/uk_rides_lake_district_1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/07093847/uk_rides_lake_district_1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/07093847/uk_rides_lake_district_1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/07093847/uk_rides_lake_district_1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/07093847/uk_rides_lake_district_1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/07093847/uk_rides_lake_district_1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/07093847/uk_rides_lake_district_1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/07093847/uk_rides_lake_district_1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/07093847/uk_rides_lake_district_1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption><em>Juan Trujillo Andrades</em></figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘Pack a long-sleeve top,’ says event organiser Josh O’Boyle. ‘This is mandatory as weather can turn quickly on top of the passes. We’ve had a few sunny years and temperatures up to 20°C, but it always starts cold. Some years we’ve had cold weather and heavy rain, so it’s key to have layers and a long-sleeve waterproof. It’s all part of looking after yourself.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Check your bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Take time to ensure your bike is in tip-top condition,’ advises Arthur. ‘For me, that meant replacing the bottom bracket before the big day. If you’re running tubeless, now is a good time to check you still have plenty of sealant and do other small jobs like checking chain wear. Ensure you have a well-stocked saddle pack too, with spare tubes and any other essentials.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get the gearing right</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"719\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/02220044/jogle_day_seven_07-719x970.jpg\" alt=\"jogle_day_seven_07\" /><figcaption>Nearing the top of the Hardknott Pass. <em>Photo: Gavin Kaps/Osprey Imagery</em></figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘The climbs are steep and unrelenting,’ says Fred finisher Chris Simpson. ‘You don’t need a 53/11 for the run to Keswick – your main concern should be being able to turn the pedals after 150km when you reach Hardknott Pass. Pick the right gearing for you and then some – 52/36 with 11-30 on the back was perfect for me, but if you can fit some smaller chainrings or a 32 on the back, why not? If you do have to get off and push, just watch out behind you and move aside to give room to everyone who needs it.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Start slow</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I learned this the hard way during my first Fred,’ says finisher Josh Woods. ‘A mate and I got carried away and pushed hard up Kirkstone Pass, Park Brow and in the paceline into Keswick. We paid for this later and by the second aid station I didn’t have much left in the tank. The result was walking up both Hardknott and Wrynose. During my second attempt I rode the first half slower. I finished 30 minutes faster and felt a lot better for it. Hold back as much as possible on the hills and try not to go into the red.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fuel, fuel, fuel</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002520/uk_ride_lake_district_09-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"uk_ride_lake_district_09\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002520/uk_ride_lake_district_09-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002520/uk_ride_lake_district_09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002520/uk_ride_lake_district_09-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002520/uk_ride_lake_district_09-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002520/uk_ride_lake_district_09-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002520/uk_ride_lake_district_09-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002520/uk_ride_lake_district_09-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002520/uk_ride_lake_district_09.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption><em>James Vincent</em></figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘Eat little and often,’ says O’Boyle. ‘It’s as much an eating contest as a cycling sportive. We offer two well-stocked feed stations with a range of savoury and sweet snacks, including our nutrition sponsor’s product, Kendal Mint Cake. The feed stations are at 74.5km and 130km. We also offer a small water stop at 112km. We always recommend you bring your own food to supplement the feed stations and to have a snack every 30 minutes after the first hour.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>…Or skip the crowds</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘If your main objective is to set a good time, avoid the feed stations and pack enough gels and snacks to get you around,’ says finisher Aaron Byrom. ‘The feed stations can be carnage, with people clipping in and out without looking around. Drink plenty as you ride and pack extra gels for Hardknott, Wrynose and Blea Tarn.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/lakes-of-fire\">Lakes of fire: Lake District UK ride</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/lake-district-cycling\">How the west was won: Lake District ride</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/jogle-the-scenic-route-day-seven\">JOGLE – The Scenic Route: Day Seven</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Control your inner Pidcock</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/02220050/jogle_day_seven_08-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"jogle_day_seven_08\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/02220050/jogle_day_seven_08-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/02220050/jogle_day_seven_08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/02220050/jogle_day_seven_08-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/02220050/jogle_day_seven_08-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/02220050/jogle_day_seven_08-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/02220050/jogle_day_seven_08-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/02220050/jogle_day_seven_08-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/02220050/jogle_day_seven_08-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/02220050/jogle_day_seven_08.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption><em>Gavin Kaps/Osprey Imagery</em></figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘This isn’t the Alps or the smooth roads of Spain,’ says Simpson. ‘It’s the Lakes. Descents are technical so watch your speed. The roads aren’t closed and it’s not uncommon to have tourists driving in the opposite direction, mixed with other riders all descending at various levels of skill. Plus the quality of the surface is mixed at best, and this is not the best time for those lightweight racing tubulars. Pick a setup that is reliable and comfy and is going to get you round. Also, check those brake pads before you set off, especially if the weather forecast is mixed. Those wet descents are even worse.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Enjoy the ride </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s a challenge, not a race,’ says Simpson. ‘If you want to go road racing, go road racing. Everyone who starts the Fred Whitton is in for a hell of a challenge, and you are getting the chance to ride through some of the most stunning scenery in England. Be courteous to other riders, take in all the local support on the route, and just breathe it all in.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• Find out more about the <a href=\"https://fredwhittonchallenge.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Fred Whitton Challenge</a></strong> </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/fred-whitton-challenge-advice\">How to prepare for the Fred Whitton Challenge: Britain’s hardest sportive</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"8c867149087752f585834e0801c8c2a4656ca0ee7c775a563a246887b4cbc0ba","category":"Cycling"}
