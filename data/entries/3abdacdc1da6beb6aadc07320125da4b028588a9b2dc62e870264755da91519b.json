If everyone you text with uses an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch, you see nice blue bubbles and it’s all handled within Apple’s iMessage system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you’re using SMS or MMS—where messages appear in green—Apple still hides the complexity, packaging it within the Messages app on various platforms. But you might be perplexed in one specific case, as one reader was: they use group messaging without all Apple ecosystem participants and every reply comes back as an individual message—the group isn’t receiving replies as a whole!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out it’s related to that pesky wiring behind the scenes. To use group messaging without iMessage, you rely on a feature in MMS. But if the feature isn’t enabled or your carrier doesn’t support it, you’ll see individual responses to all group messages sent.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ios-14-mms-meesages-setting.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To enable it if it’s available, go to <em>Settings &gt; Messages</em> and enable <em>MMS Messaging</em> and <em>Group Messaging</em>. If neither option is available, contact your carrier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Peggy.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
