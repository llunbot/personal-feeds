Foxconn currently supplies servers to Amazon, OpenAI, and Nvidia for AI applications. Foxconn is already Apple's primary supplier of data center servers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> said that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/19/apple-experimenting-with-chatgpt-tool/\">working on \"Apple GPT\"</a> artificial intelligence projects that could rival OpenAI's ChatGPT. Apple does not yet have a \"clear strategy\" for creating a product for consumers, and while it could be planning to make a \"significant\" AI announcement in 2024, Gurman claims it has no concrete plans as of yet. According to analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, the progress of Apple's generative AI technology is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/no-sign-of-apple-generative-ai-coming-2024/\">significantly behind its competitors</a> and there is no sign that the company plans to launch AI services next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDuring Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/03/apple-q3-2023-earnings-call-takeaways/\">earnings call</a> last week, CEO ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a>‌ said that AI and machine learning are \"core fundamental technologies integral to virtually every product\" that Apple builds. AI is  apparently \"absolutely critical\" to Apple, with Cook confirming that Apple has been investigating generative AI \"for years.\"<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foxconn/\">Foxconn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/udn-com/\">Economic Daily News</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/\">Artificial Intelligence</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/08/apple-to-test-ai-services-with-foxconn-servers/\">Apple Planning to Test AI Services Using Foxconn Servers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-planning-to-test-ai-services-using-foxconn-servers.2398068/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3c4ae5bf8f600e37bafb4f06e69de4f5a21f92c77cd2a9debdeba9422df24e1d","category":"Apple"}
