Usually, when said piece is introduced, there is a sea of elation and discontent— the “if it’s not broke, why fix it?” attitude from detractors who would rather keep the familiar. Canyons CFR helmets with the Hi-Bar strap system aren’t flawless (listed later). However, they signal a protocol change for helmet retention, hopeful headwear progress, and maybe fewer head injuries.   </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-fence--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-fence--1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"CFR Helmet review solo fence\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-fence--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-fence--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-fence--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-fence--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-fence--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(All Photos: Jordan Villella/BikeRumor)</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Disruptr CFR</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can check out our <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/canyon-cfr-helmets-rethinks-retention-with-watt-saving-highbar-system/\">full tech breakdown here </a>if you’re new to the Canyon Disruptr CFR helmet. In a nutshell, the Disruptr CFR signals Canyon’s entry into the helmet space. Like most avenues Canyon pursues, they started at the very top of the line. Canyon launched <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-us/gear/apparel/helmets/\">two helmets simultaneously</a>: the Disruptr CFR, an all-around road and gravel helmet, and the Stingr CFR, which is more aero-focused. Both designs feature the new and innovative HighBar retention system.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-dial-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-dial-scaled.webp\" alt=\"CFR Helmet review solo dial\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-dial-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-dial-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-dial-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-dial-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-dial-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-dial-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What makes it different?</em> Unlike classic webbing-style straps, the HighBar is rigid and uses a BOA-style (not actually BOA brand) strap instead of a buckle. This retention style is how the HighBar stays firmly on the rider’s head.

Usually, I wear a medium in Trek, Lazer, KASK, and the like. I found the Canyon Disruptr CFR to be on par with others’ fit and sizing. The profile and shape of the Disruptr are slightly more bulbous than others in its category. Still, in a world where the (<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sweet-protection-redeemer-2vi-tt-helmet-goes-really-really-big/\">Sweet Protection Redeemer 2Vi Mips helmet</a>) exists, this is a reasonably tame silhouette.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-inside--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-inside--scaled.webp\" alt=\"CFR Helmet review solo inside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-inside--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-inside--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-inside--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-inside--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-inside--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-inside--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The elephant in the room with the Disruptr CFR is the HighBar system. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you played any sports that require a helmet (non-cycling), like US Football, Hockey, Lacrosse, and so on, the fit of the HighBar system will feel familiar to you. The retainment pieces follow the face contours but don’t touch the skin. The chin strap gave me intense hockey flashbacks, but not in a bad way. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-put-on-helmet-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-put-on-helmet-scaled.webp\" alt=\"CFR Helmet review solo put on helmet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-put-on-helmet-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-put-on-helmet-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-put-on-helmet-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-put-on-helmet-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-put-on-helmet-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-put-on-helmet-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Serious stuff…I felt like RoboCop… all for the review.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Serious Business </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The goofiest part about the HighBar system is how to disengage it to put the helmet on. The bar straps move on a hinge located near the temple. To “unlock” the system, you have to move the bar to your forehead, put the helmet on, and then lower it. It’s no less ridiculous than putting on a skinsuit or aero-socks, but it’s new, and new can be weird/bad to cyclists (myself included).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-highbar--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-highbar--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Canyon Disruptr CFR Helmet review highbar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-highbar--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-highbar--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-highbar--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-highbar--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-highbar--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-highbar--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you lower the chinstrap, tighten the Boa-style dial, and you’re off. The chin strap has slight padding on the inside but doesn’t interfere with the fit. It reminds me of the feel of the Rudy Project helmets with the thick buckle cover. The HighBar retention system is a different fit for everyone. Some may dislike it from the start, and others (like myself) will have no issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-ride-review--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-ride-review--1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Canyon Disruptr CFR Helmet ride review\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-ride-review--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-ride-review--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-ride-review--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-ride-review--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-ride-review--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-side--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-side--1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Canyon Disruptr CFR Helmet review side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-side--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-side--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-side--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-side--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-side--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>On the rails to trails, I like to rock a headphone in. I thought the placement of the HighBar might mess this up, but it fits very nicely. </figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Does it work?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If by “work” you mean staying on the rider’s head, then yes, 100% it is more effective than classic webbing straps that are poorly adjusted. <em>Why not just adjust the straps correctly?</em> Some new riders might not know how to properly fit a helmet (something they should learn at their local shop upon purchase). Canyon is taking that misfitting out of the equation with the HighBar design, which is seemingly unable to be improperly fitted. Plus, they lack customer touch points like a classic bike shop.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-weight--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-weight--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Canyon Disruptr CFR Helmet review weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-weight--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-weight--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-weight--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-weight--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-weight--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-weight--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>The HighBar is slightly heavier than the classic webbing. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>How does it compare to the competition for weight and price? </em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trek Velocis MIPS, 258g: </strong>$299.99</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Trek Ballista MIPS,</strong> <strong>268g:</strong> $299.99</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>S-Works Prevail 3, 271g:</strong> $300.00</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Specialized S-Works Evade 3, 272g</strong>: $300.00</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Giro Aries, 270g:</strong> $300.00</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Kask Protone Icon, 239g: </strong>$299.00</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Kask Utopia, 258g: </strong>$300.00</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>MET Trenta MIPS, 250g:</strong> $260</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Canyon Disruptr CFR, 275g:</strong> $299.00</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>*All weights are in size Medium</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Disruptr’s weight is more like that of an aero helmet and not an all-around, only by a few grams, but we might as well count everything while we’re at it. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-solo-front--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-solo-front--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Canyon Disruptr CFR Helmet review solo front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-solo-front--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-solo-front--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-solo-front--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-solo-front--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-solo-front--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-solo-front--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>How About the Aerodynamics? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another claim from HighBar is that the fixed positioning of the “strap” helps with aerodynamics and is faster than traditional webbing (around 10-20 watts, but that pushing it). This claim is valid, and in most wind tunnel testing, helmet manufacturers test helmets with the webbing taped down to the dummy. Now, I’m no aerospace engineer, but that makes sense. On the other hand, wouldn’t a properly fitted webbing strap with sunglasses over the strap negate some of the flapping? </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-front--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-front--1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Canyon Disruptr CFR Helmet review front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-front--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-front--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-front--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-front--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-front--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Less wind noise? </em>Not from what I could tell, but my eardrums are blown from playing in a punk band for most of my life. I will say that the sounds of wind and strap sensation are more consistent than with webbing. When you move your head, the webbing straps can sometimes catch wind and flap. That doesn’t happen with the HighBar system. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-ear-phones--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-ear-phones--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Canyon Disruptr CFR Helmet review ear phones\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-ear-phones--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-ear-phones--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-ear-phones--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-ear-phones--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-ear-phones--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-review-ear-phones--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Canyon Disruptr CFR Ride Impressions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been using the Canyon Disruptr CFR for quite a while and in many different conditions. It takes some getting used to, but I like the HighBar system. Some small bits that will annoy newcomers include things like glasses going under the strap and the fitting near the cheekbones being slightly intrusive. Otherwise, I felt at home with the Canyon Disruptr CFR in various conditions and temperatures. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-inside--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-inside--scaled.webp\" alt=\"CFR Helmet review solo inside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-inside--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-inside--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-inside--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-inside--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-inside--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-inside--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of my rides were on my gravel, road, or cyclocross bikes. Training for cyclocross in the summer is pretty cruel, and going all out in 90 degrees is rough, but Disruptr CFR was good at thermoregulation and keeping the head cool. The large vents are excellent, allowing airflow and proper sunglass retention (with pads included). The HighBar strap claims to help cool the head, and although I didn’t feel that much cooler to note a difference, it certainly did not make the helmet hotter. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-back-padding--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-back-padding--scaled.webp\" alt=\"CFR Helmet review solo back padding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-back-padding--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-back-padding--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-back-padding--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-back-padding--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-back-padding--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-back-padding--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-rear--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-rear--scaled.webp\" alt=\"CFR Helmet review solo rear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-rear--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-rear--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-rear--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-rear--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-rear--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-rear--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Padding and Sweat Retention</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Canyon Disruptr CFR helmet uses MIPS Air Node for the protective liner and main padding. The peripheral padding is a dense foam that doesn’t hold sweat but offers support in critical areas. I found this padding a nice feature along the cradle of the rear of the helmet. The main padding is robust and retains sweat well.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-front--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-front--scaled.webp\" alt=\"CFR Helmet review solo front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-front--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-front--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-front--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-front--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-front--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-front--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Easy Cleaning</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I like the robust design of the Disruptr CFR and the HighBar system. Traditional webbing straps can get gross after muddy races or super summer training sessions, and it’s hard to wash them all out. I found the Disruptr CFR much easier to maintain (bucket washing with dish soap) and the HighBar system to hold less odor than a traditional webbing strap. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-side--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-side--scaled.webp\" alt=\"CFR Helmet review solo side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-side--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-side--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-side--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-side--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-side--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFR-Helmet-review-solo-side--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Is the HighBar system a game-changer?</em><strong><em> </em></strong>In my opinion, yes. <em>Why? </em>It’s starting a conversation on how to better support helmets staying on riders’ heads. <em>Is it perfect?</em> Not at all, and some riders will probably not like it, but it’s starting the ball rolling toward safer helmet designs, and I’m all for that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Im bummed that Canyon totes the additional light option, but it’s another $27.90 if you’d like it. I understand this is a pro-level offering, but that would be an extra slam dunk for safety if they provided it at no charge. I see it as a missed opportunity for the first adopters to get something extra while taking a chance on a new safety-driven design. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Would I race the Disruptr CFR and seek it out as my only helmet? </em>Currently, I am reaching for two helmets in my stock, the MET Trenta MIPS and the Disruptr CFR. These fit my head perfectly, and I like the breezy airflow of the Disruptr CFR. The easy-to-clean nature of the helmet is a big plus, especially going into ‘cross season. Nothing is worse than a smelly helmet before you ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recommend the Canyon Disruptr CFR for any rider who doesn’t mind a spin on the traditional. The helmet fit (excluding the strap) is relatively conventional, and it’s highly recommended if you’re a caustic sweater with chalky-looking webbing straps after every ride in the heat. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-us/gear/apparel/helmets/canyon-disruptr-cfr-helmet/9102290.html\">Canyon.com</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-canyon-disruptr-cfr-highbar-helmet-retention-system/\">Despite Unique Aesthetics &amp; Additional Weight, Canyons CFR Helmet Is a Game Changer</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"79c59f364b4a267b9b87349732725db655fb15ecf96489152473dcdcdb69abac","category":"Cycling"}
