A new version with the current design is in the works for the first half of next year with a faster processor, the people said.</blockquote>The first half of 2024 passed by without a new Apple TV, so that rumor has expired, and there have been no credible rumors about the device since. As such, it is currently unclear when the next Apple TV will be released.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple recently announced that it will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/\">holding a special event on September 9</a>, but the only products firmly rumored to be unveiled then include new iPhones, Apple Watches, and AirPods, with no expectation of a new Apple TV so far.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is when the previous five Apple TV models were announced:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> October 2022</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Second-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> April 2021</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>First-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> September 2017</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Apple TV HD:</strong> September 2015</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV:</strong> March 2012</li></ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhenever it comes out, the next Apple TV is rumored to feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/\">faster processor</a> than the current A15 Bionic chip, and even lower pricing. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the next Apple TV <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/kuo-even-cheaper-apple-tv/\">could have a sub-$100 starting price</a>. The current Apple TV starts at $129 in the U.S. with 64GB of storage, and a 128GB model is available for $149.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth the second-generation (2010) and third-generation (2012) models of the Apple TV were priced at $99 in the U.S. at launch, and Apple eventually lowered the price of the third-generation model to $69, so there is precedent for a sub-$100 Apple TV that would better compete with low-priced streaming devices sold by the likes of Amazon and Roku.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo major design changes have been rumored for the next Apple TV specifically, but Gurman said Apple has considered <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/\">adding a built-in camera</a> to a future model. tvOS 17 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-iphone-facetime-camera-apple-tv/\">added a FaceTime app to the Apple TV</a>, allowing for users to have video calls by using the rear camera on a connected iPhone or iPad. If the Apple TV gained a built-in camera, users would no longer need to rely on an external device for video calls on the TV.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/29/when-is-a-new-apple-tv-coming-out/\">Will a New Apple TV Still Launch This Year?</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/will-a-new-apple-tv-still-launch-this-year.2434693/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6125eaeffff3094ddc9ddcc2bfc6854c4819fce4b5d9f9475c6d1a892f1c5bde","category":"Apple"}
