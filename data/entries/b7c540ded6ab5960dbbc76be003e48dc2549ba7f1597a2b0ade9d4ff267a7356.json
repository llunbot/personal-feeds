{"title":"Let’s Keep an Eye on Apple’s Own iOS Adoption Numbers","link":"https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/","date":1769717928000,"content":"\n<p>When I wrote last week about <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2026/01/ios_26_adoption_rate_is_not_bizarrely_low\">the false narrative that iOS 26 is seeing bizarrely low adoption rates</a> compared to previous years, I neglected one source: Apple itself. Apple’s Developer site publishes a page with <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/\">iOS and iPadOS usage for devices that “transacted on the App Store”</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The hitch is that they only seem to update those numbers twice a year — once right around now, and once again right before WWDC. As of today, those numbers are still from 4 June 2025. Last year, going from the Internet Archive, the numbers were still from iOS 17 (June 2024) <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250123123759/https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/\">on 23 January</a> last year, but were updated for iOS 18 <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250125013020/https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/\">on 24 January</a>. Here are those iOS 18 numbers from one year ago this week.</p>\n\n<p>iPhones released in the previous four years:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iOS 18: 76%</li>\n<li>iOS 17: 19%</li>\n<li>iOS &lt; 17: 5%</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All iPhones:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iOS 18: 68%</li>\n<li>iOS 17: 19%</li>\n<li>iOS &lt; 17: 13%</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>iPads released in the previous four years:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPadOS 18: 63%</li>\n<li>iPadOS 17: 27%</li>\n<li>iPadOS &lt; 17: 10%</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All iPads:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPadOS 18: 53%</li>\n<li>iPadOS 17: 28%</li>\n<li>iPadOS &lt; 17: 19%</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(Apple itself manages to present these statistics without ever using the plurals <em>iPhones</em> or <em>iPads</em>, instead referring only to “devices”.)</p>\n\n<p>A year prior in early 2024, Apple updated the numbers at some point between <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240123183314/https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/\">23 January</a> and <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240206013405/https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/\">6 February</a>. I presume, or at least hope, that they’ll update these numbers for iOS 26 any day now.</p>\n\n<p>[<strong>Update, 17 February 2026:</strong> “<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2026/02/apple_releases_ios_26_adoption_rates\">Apple Releases iOS 26 Adoption Rates, and They’re Pretty Much in Line With the Last Few Years</a>”.]</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/29/apples-own-ios-adoption-numbers\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b7c540ded6ab5960dbbc76be003e48dc2549ba7f1597a2b0ade9d4ff267a7356","category":"Tech"}
