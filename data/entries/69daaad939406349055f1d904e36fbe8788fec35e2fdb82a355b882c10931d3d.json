The tall stack, a slightly lowered bottom bracket, and generous stays yield an unbelievably smooth ride and inspire confidence when descending fast over loose terrain. Fairly traditional head tube and seat tube angles keep everything quick and maneuverable with an agile and responsive front end.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/WILDE-BIKES-49.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Tubing</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.wildebikes.com/collections/bikes/products/earth-ship-titanium-frameset\" target=\"_blank\">Titanium</a>: Butted Titanium Main Triangle with custom S-bend seat and chainstays.

Hardtail</strong></a><br />\nWilde’s signature mountain bike frame that can be built according to individual riders’ desired suspension travel, fit, and riding style. It’s available in steel, titanium, or aluminum and, at this time, made to order with a lead time of four to five months. While build options for the Yo Jeffy! are plentiful, the titanium frame pictured belongs to Jeffrey Frane and is built around a 120mm fork. This enables seamless swapping for an Enve Mountain carbon fork without altering the bike’s geometry. It fits 29 x 2.6 tires and is capable of running a derailleur or as a single speed. The geometry is a mix of trail and race with a 67.4 degree head tube angle and a high bottom bracket. The anodized finish is done by Agave Finish Works in Durango, CO.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/WILDE-BIKES-46.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/WILDE-BIKES-8.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/WILDE-BIKES-17.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Stock Build Specs</strong><br />\nAnodized downtube logo – other options available at an additional charge<br />\nStealth dropper routing<br />\nTwo water bottle mounts<br />\nParagon Modular cable guide system</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/WILDE-BIKES-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /> <img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/WILDE-BIKES-20.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Options</strong><br />\nTop tube feedbag mount<br />\nThird water bottle mount<br />\nInternal rear brake routing<br />\nSliding dropouts<br />\nSteel Fork</p>\n<p>Head over to <a href=\"https://www.wildebikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wilde’s website</a> to explore more details on these frames and to check out their <a href=\"https://www.wildebikes.com/collections/apparel\" target=\"_blank\">apparel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wildebikes.com/collections/frontpage\" target=\"_blank\">accessories</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2021/12/wilde-bicycle-company/\">A Love Letter to Cycling: Introducing Wilde Bicycle Company</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Josh Weinberg","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"69daaad939406349055f1d904e36fbe8788fec35e2fdb82a355b882c10931d3d","category":"Cycling"}
