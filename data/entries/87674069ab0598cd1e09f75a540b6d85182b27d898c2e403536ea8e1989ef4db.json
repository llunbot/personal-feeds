Other additions include a new UberXXL vehicle option, UberX Share at airports for discounted rides with one other passenger, and more, with complete details outlined <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/newsroom/airport-travel/\">in Uber's press release</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUberXXL lets you request a vehicle with larger trunk space for your baggage on rides to and from airports.
