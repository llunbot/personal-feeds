Two years to the day since the city had been hit by a series of terrorist attacks that killed 52 people and injured more than 770 others, crowds ten or more deep lined the capital’s roads. More still sat in public parks watching the action on large screens. Transport for London later estimated somewhere between 900,000 to 1.5 million people attended the spectacle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You couldn’t hear anything – not even the sound of your tyres. It was a wall of roaring voices,’ Tour debutant Mark Cavendish said afterwards. ‘It was amazing.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those spectators watched 189 riders roll down the start ramp in Whitehall and onto a near-8km long prologue course that passed the Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace and the Serpentine before heading to the finish line on The Mall. While the large attendance painted a picture of a sport in good health, in truth it was a troubling time for the race. The 2006 winner, Floyd Landis, was in the middle of an appeal process against his subsequent disqualification for doping, and the 1996 winner, Bjarne Riis, had recently confessed to doping during his own career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘My yellow jersey is in a box in my garage at home,’ Riis had said. ‘You can come and collect it. What matters to me are my memories.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/fred-wright-cyclist\">Fred Wright Q&amp;A: ‘Only a matter of time, really’</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/british-riders-giro-ditalia\">Lads on (Grand) Tour: The 10 Brits at the Giro d’Italia 2022</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Men’s Tour de France 2023: Stage-by-stage preview and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>That confession meant Riis wasn’t welcome at the Tour in his capacity as manager of the CSC team, yet his squad still took the first yellow jersey with Fabian Cancellara, wearing the rainbow bands of Time-Trial World Champion, stopping the clock 13 seconds quicker than Astana’s Andreas Klöden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next day the huge crowds returned as the peloton headed out of London, bound for Canterbury. David Millar escaped the bunch for much of the stage and amassed enough points to take the polka dot jersey. Cavendish meanwhile crashed into a spectator 25km from home – ‘He ran into someone and was half-fighting with the man he ran into on the street,’ his sports director Brian Holm said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie McEwen also hit the tarmac but remarkably was able to recover to take his 13th and final Tour stage win. It had been a glorious and incident-packed couple of days. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"641\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/tour-history-140-641x970.jpg\" alt=\"Tour de France 2007\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/tour-history-140-641x970.jpg 641w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/tour-history-140-198x300.jpg 198w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/tour-history-140-768x1162.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/tour-history-140-1016x1536.jpg 1016w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/tour-history-140-750x1134.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/tour-history-140-1140x1724.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/tour-history-140.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>L'Equipe</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘I don’t know when we will come back,’ Tour director Christian Prudhomme said. ‘But one thing is certain, it is not possible for us not to return.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that the Tour caravan packed up and headed across the Channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It has just been such an opportunity,’ Millar reflected at the time. ‘There were flags and my name painted out and everyone was just cheering my name… it’s a big thank you to everyone for coming out and supporting us.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A caravan of ridicule</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the backdrop to the race, before the Tour’s rollout in London every rider had signed a ‘commitment to a new cycling’, designed to take a stand against doping. As it turned out, the 2007 race would become one of the most controversial editions ever staged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First news broke that T-Mobile rider Patrik Sinkewitz had tested positive for elevated levels of testosterone at a training camp. Sinkewitz had already abandoned, having crashed, but with disillusionment already high, the revelations were enough to prompt German TV to pack up their cameras and leave.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the race entered its second phase, stories started swirling about Michael Rasmussen – now wearing the yellow jersey – having missed out-of-competition tests. He shrugged off the claims and carried on racing while Alexandre Vinokourov, one of the pre-race favourites, recorded a positive test for a prohibited blood transfusion. He was thrown off the race, the whole Astana team withdrawing alongside him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came Stage 16 – 218km from Orthez to the summit of the Col d’Aubisque. Three days earlier Rasmussen had gone head-to-head against Alberto Contador on the climb to Plateau de Beille. Contador had prevailed that day, claiming his first Tour stage win though not gaining any significant time. On the Aubisque, Rasmussen fought back, winning and taking meaningful seconds over Contador and Levi Leipheimer. All looked good for the Dane on the road, even if he had been booed by spectators, but that evening his Rabobank team confirmed that they had thrown Rasmussen off the race after he had admitted misleading authorities on his whereabouts in June.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"842\" height=\"297\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg 842w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-750x265.jpg 750w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The news that the Tour’s leader had been sent home came just hours after it had been announced that Cristian Moreni of Cofidis had tested positive for testosterone. Off went Moreni and the entire team, including a 27-year-old Bradley Wiggins, who later wrote that he chucked his jersey in the bin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was farcical. <em>France Soir</em> ran a mock obituary declaring the death of the race ‘at the age of 104, after a long illness’, while <em>Liberation</em> declared the event a ‘caravan of ridicule’, and said, ‘If the organisers really intend to save cycling, they should stop the race.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contador, who hadn’t been able to ride in 2006 because of alleged links to the Operación Puerto case (he was later cleared), assumed yellow and held it to Paris, with Cadel Evans finishing second and Levi Leipheimer third. Just 31 seconds separated Contador from Leipheimer, the shortest time gap between first and third in Tour history. Leipheimer would later be stripped of his podium finish as part of the USADA investigation into doping at US Postal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tour’s organisers may have sighed with relief at getting to Paris, but the problems continued, with Basque rider Iban Mayo also confirmed to have returned a positive test for EPO. The optimism that had greeted the Tour in London was now nothing but a distant memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s obviously not been great,’ said 21-year-old Tour debutant Geraint Thomas. ‘But times and attitudes are slowly changing… it’s good for the future that people are being caught now.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 140 of Cyclist magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-london\">Tour de France history: London hosts Le Tour in 2007</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"bdd62aa3d3c26539d261fec4d49ef037c3d9bf2b6a811aed4370634f393139b5","category":"Cycling"}
