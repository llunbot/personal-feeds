The electric vehicle manufacturer was hosting media members not only to demonstrate how far Rivian has come since buying a former Mitsubishi plant in 2017 but also to launch its new, range-increasing Enduro drive unit that's now available across its entire EV lineup.</p>\n<p>As a startup in a crowded and established industry, Rivian has pursued a strategy of vertical integration to keep its costs down.
