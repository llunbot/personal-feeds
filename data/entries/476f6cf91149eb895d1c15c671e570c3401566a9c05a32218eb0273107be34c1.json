The Nexode laptop power banks from Ugreen are available in three sizes: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-12000mAh-Charging-Portable-Charger/dp/B0CXJ1F1M7\" target=\"_blank\">12,000mAh</a> ($49) <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-20000mAh-Portable-Charger-Charging/dp/B0CXHNGDC1\" target=\"_blank\">20,000mAh</a> ($99 / £89) and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-25000mAh-Portable-Charger-Charging/dp/B0CXHM5RY2\" target=\"_blank\">25,000mAh</a> ($129) capacity. All three have the same striking brick design and large display. Different designs are available depending on the required use. I looked at the medium size because it is perfect for MacBook users and photographers. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Everything on board</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nexode Power Bank has three charging ports: two USB-C, one of which also serves as an input for charging the power bank, and one USB-A. The maximum charging power with two connected devices is 130W, the USB-C1 alone can output a maximum of 100W and the USB-C2 30W. With three devices connected, the USB-C2 and USB-A are throttled to a shared 15W, resulting in a maximum output power of 115W. Otherwise, the USB-C2 can deliver a maximum of 30W individually and the USB-A a maximum of 22.5W when one only is used with the 100W USB-C port, allowing for the total 130W output promised in the product’s name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I measured excellent values for the charging speed within 30 minutes on the USB-C1. A <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2259608/15-inch-macbook-air-m3-review.html\">MacBook Air M3</a> was charged by 56%, an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369843/m4-ipad-pro-1tb-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">11-inch iPad Pro</a> by 36% and an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2091512/iphone-15-pro-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone 15</a> by 55%. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To recharge the power bank you need a USB-C Power Delivery charger with at least 65W. The power bank can be charged up 100W, in which case the charging process took less than two hours in my test. The informative display shows the incoming power. The promised 100W was not achieved in my case, and it was no more than 70W.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the power when charging the power bank and the charging power of connected devices, the display also optionally shows the current and voltage. The most important indication of capacity is displayed as a large percentage and the remaining charging time is shown in the corner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only thing that bothers me about the charging connections is the fixed allocation of power. Some power banks allow the user to customize the power outputs and prioritize the ports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you would expect, the electronics monitor the charging process and the temperature. The housing is made of flame-retardant material. The type of 21700 lithium-ion cells installed should still have 80 percent of their charging capacity after 1,000 full charging cycles. Unfortunately, the display does not provide any information about the charging cycles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The brick design has advantages and disadvantages for a power bank. One advantage is the better thermal control of the batteries, another is the generous arrangement of the charging ports and the large display. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The developers have also thought about the rubber coating on the underside. This means that neither the power bank nor your precious table will get scratched. The power bank also comes with a transport bag and a short charging cable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a weight of 16.9oz (480g) and dimensions of 2.1 x 2 x 5.2 inches (5.4 x 5.1 x 13.1cm), the Nexode Power Bank is suitable for traveling.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><ul><li><figure><img alt=\"Ugreen NexodePB20k130W 01\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ugreen_NexodePB20k130W_01.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Diagramm Ladegera te\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Diagramm_Ladegerate-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Ugreen NexodePB20k130W 07\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ugreen_NexodePB20k130W_07.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Ugreen NexodePB20k130W 08\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ugreen_NexodePB20k130W_08.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li></ul><a></a><a></a><a></a><div></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh costs <a href=\"https://www.ugreen.com/products/ugreen-nexode-power-bank-20000mah-130w\" target=\"_blank\">$99.99</a> / <a href=\"https://uk.ugreen.com/products/ugreen-nexode-power-bank-130w-20000mah\" target=\"_blank\">£89.99</a>, which is a reasonable price for a well-built battery pack that you can trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the charging speed is impressive and the price is attractive, the Ugreen Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh is an excellent tool for the mobile worker. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>See how the Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh compares to other <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2395511/best-laptop-power-banks-for-macbook.html\">laptop power banks for MacBook</a> in our review round-up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on our sister publication </em><a href=\"https://www.macwelt.de/\" target=\"_blank\">Macwelt</a><em> and was translated and localized from German.</em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"476f6cf91149eb895d1c15c671e570c3401566a9c05a32218eb0273107be34c1","category":"Apple"}
