The developers at MachineGames need to pay homage to the source material without resorting to the kind of slavish devotion that amounts to a mere retread of a familiar story. At the same time, any new Indy adventure carries with it the weight not just of the character's many film and TV appearances but also well-remembered games like <em>Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis</em>. Then there are game franchises like Tomb Raider and Uncharted, which have already put their own significant stamps on the Indiana Jones formula of action-packed, devil-may-care treasure-hunting.</p>\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241201163836_1-1024x576.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241201163836_1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241201163836_1-640x360.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241201163836_1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241201163836_1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241201163836_1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241201163836_1-384x216.jpg 384w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241201163836_1-1152x648.jpg 1152w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241201163836_1-980x551.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241201163836_1-1440x810.jpg 1440w\" />\n      No, this is not a scene from a new Uncharted game.\n        Credit:\n          Bethesda / MachineGames\n      \n<p>Surprisingly, <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> bears all this pressure pretty well. While the stealth-exploration gameplay and simplistic puzzles can feel a bit trite at points, the game's excellent presentation, top-notch world-building, and fun-filled, campy storyline drive one of Indy's most memorable adventures since the original movie trilogy.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-captures-the-feel-of-a-great-indy-movie/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-captures-the-feel-of-a-great-indy-movie/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fad2c080aceda7c6107ad13d7c8f3eb6a3e614d97df61ea9f686651215f39f33","category":"Tech"}
