However, <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1890069182286602362\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> believes the post is a teaser for Apple announcing a new iPhone SE. He previously said the device <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/gurman-iphone-se-4-by-next-week/\">would be unveiled by next week</a>, with rumored features including an A18 chip, a larger 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, a USB-C port, Apple Intelligence support, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWill any other new products be announced next week? Rumors suggest new MacBook Air, iPad Air, and entry-level iPad models will be launching in the coming weeks, and other devices expected to launch this year include a new AirTag, an all-new smart home hub, and more. We shall find out exactly what Apple has planned in six days from now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCook's post seems to be more of a teaser rather than an event invite, so it seems likely that any announcements would be shared in press releases on the Apple Newsroom website. But, there could be YouTube announcement videos too, like we saw when Apple announced new iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro models with M4 chips last October.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-launch-february-19/\">Tim Cook Teases an 'Apple Launch' Next Wednesday</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tim-cook-teases-an-apple-launch-next-wednesday.2449316/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6ea2e977dc1ef93f981e853f1d1c330ee9b4310d9ee22a17f88d48b7c5ff995b","category":"Apple"}
