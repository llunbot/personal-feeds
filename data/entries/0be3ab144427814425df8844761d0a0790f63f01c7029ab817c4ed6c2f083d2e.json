{"title":"VMware Fusion Pro 13 Now Freely Available for Personal Use","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/vmware-fusion-pro-13-free-personal-use/","date":1715779298000,"content":"VMware has <a href=\"https://blogs.vmware.com/teamfusion/2024/05/fusion-pro-now-available-free-for-personal-use.html\">announced</a> that its Fusion Pro and Workstation Pro virtualization software is now free for personal use. For those unfamiliar with Fusion, it is designed to allow Mac users to operate virtual machines to run non-macOS operating systems like Windows 11.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/vmware-fusion-pro-13.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe decision to make the software free was made by Broadcom, which acquired VMware in November 2023. In a <a href=\"https://blogs.vmware.com/teamfusion/2024/05/fusion-pro-now-available-free-for-personal-use.html\">blog post</a> announcing the change, Broadcom said the move was part of a plan to simplify how the company brings VMware apps to market: \r<br />\n<blockquote>Fusion Pro and Workstation Pro will now have two license models. We now provide a Free Personal Use or a Paid Commercial Use subscription for our Pro apps. Users will decide based on their use case whether a commercial subscription is required.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis means that everyday users who want a virtual lab on their Mac, Windows or Linux computer can do so for free simply by registering and downloading the bits from the new download portal located at <a href=\"https://support.broadcom.com\">support.broadcom.com</a>.</blockquote>Broadcom also said it had discontinued Workstation Player and Fusion Player, although existing customers can upgrade to the more feature-packed Pro version at no extra cost. Meanwhile, VMware Player will remain bundled with Workstation Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBroadcom said that customers who use Fusion and Workstation at/for work will still require a paid commercial subscription, which can be purchased through an authorized Broadcom Advantage partner.
