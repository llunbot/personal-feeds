In other cases, hackers working in nation-state-backed advanced persistent threat groups take control of devices previously hacked by the cybercrime groups. Sometimes the devices are independently compromised multiple times by different groups. The result is a free-for-all inside routers and, to a lesser extent, VPN devices and virtual private servers provided by hosting companies.</p>\n<p>“Cybercriminals and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors share a common interest in proxy anonymization layers and Virtual Private Network (VPN) nodes to hide traces of their presence and make detection of malicious activities more difficult,” Trend Micro researchers Feike Hacquebord and Fernando Merces <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/24/e/router-roulette.html\">wrote</a>. “This shared interest results in malicious internet traffic blending financial and espionage motives.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021233#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021233&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ec37e0fd0764055ae1cd24c88611a7999311512df93a7abeb8e15a3077a49129","category":"Tech"}
