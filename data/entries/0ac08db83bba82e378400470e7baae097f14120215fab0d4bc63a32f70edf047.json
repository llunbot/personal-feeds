It also has you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aligning terrain types for resources</li>\n<li>Placing both your troops and the enemy's</li>\n<li>Choosing which cards to upgrade, sell, and bring into battle</li>\n<li>Picking between terrain types to leave behind</li>\n<li>Upgrading a tech tree with achievements</li>\n<li>Picking the sequence of battles for maximum effectiveness</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Drop Duchy</em> is a quirky game, one that hasn't entirely fused together its various influences without some seams showing. But I keep returning to it, even as it beats me to a pulp on Normal mode, based on decisions I made five rounds ago. It feels like a medium-deep board game, played at triple speed, with someone across the table timing you on how fast you arrange your tiles.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/drop-duchy-is-a-deck-building-tetris-like-carcassonne-esque-puzzler/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/drop-duchy-is-a-deck-building-tetris-like-carcassonne-esque-puzzler/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0ac08db83bba82e378400470e7baae097f14120215fab0d4bc63a32f70edf047","category":"Tech"}
