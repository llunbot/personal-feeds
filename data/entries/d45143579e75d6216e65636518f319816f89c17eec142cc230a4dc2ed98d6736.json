The regulator had ordered Apple to remove restrictions on alternative payment systems and allow developers to market different payment options for in-app purchases, threatening daily fines of $43,000 for non-compliance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBut Judge Eduardo Santos da Rocha Penteado of the 14th Federal Civil Court on Thursday called the original decision by Brazil's competition regulator (Cade) \"disproportionate and unnecessary.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn his decision, Penteado acknowledged that the measures demanded by Cade would \"change, in a sensitive and structural way\" Apple's business operations. He said that the technical complexity of the required changes and the global regulatory landscape, particularly similar decisions in the European Union, warranted a more thorough discussion.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe decision came hours after reports emerged of Apple appealing the original order, with the company arguing that the required changes were too complex to implement within the given time frame.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the injunction has been overturned, the broader antitrust investigation into Apple's App Store practices will continue. Cade is expected to appeal the court's decision, and Apple could still eventually be required to implement changes to its App Store policies in Brazil.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe case follows similar regulatory challenges Apple faces globally, including a recent <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/eu-fines-apple-2-billion/\">â‚¬1.8 billion fine</a> from the European Commission over music streaming app restrictions. Apple has maintained throughout that the Brazilian regulator's demands would threaten user privacy and security.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Via <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/12/05/brazilian-court-apple-app-store/\">9to5Mac</a>.)</em><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/brazil/\">Brazil</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/judge-sides-with-apple-app-store-reform-order/\">Apple Wins Last-Gasp Reprieve From Brazil App Store Changes</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-wins-last-gasp-reprieve-from-brazil-app-store-changes.2444751/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d45143579e75d6216e65636518f319816f89c17eec142cc230a4dc2ed98d6736","category":"Apple"}
