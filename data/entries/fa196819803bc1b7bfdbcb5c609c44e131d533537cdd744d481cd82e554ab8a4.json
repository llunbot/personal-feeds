We’ve all been there, impatiently waiting in the kitchen in damp kit after you finally get home, waiting for your feet to thaw out before you can hop into the shower and recover properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Socks might be a relatively small part of your kit, but underestimate them at your peril. Investing a little in a few pairs of dedicated winter cycling socks won’t stop the skies from opening or the temperatures plummeting, but they’ll certainly help make your cycling more pleasurable through the less accommodating months. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From under a tenner for budget-friendly options to £35 for dedicated waterproof socks, we’ve pulled together some of our go-to options for winter cycling socks, as well as our advice on what to look for when you come to make your buying decision. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cyclist’s top picks of the best winter cycling

Three sizes are available, to suit feet between EU 36-50. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand’s best selling sock is made from a merino blend, which gives natural antimicrobial and odour-resistant properties, but these are also durable enough to last you for multiple seasons of winter riding, speaking from experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great care has been taken to ensure comfort when it comes to the sock design, including a carefully placed flat seam across the top of the toe, compression at the arch of the foot and ankle, and a deep welt at the top of the cuff to prevent the sock from digging in to the back of the leg. The footbed of the sock is also padded to add comfort and extra insulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rapha Pro Team Winter Socks</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Rapha-Pro-Team-winter-socks-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Rapha Pro Team winter socks\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Rapha-Pro-Team-winter-socks-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Rapha-Pro-Team-winter-socks-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Rapha-Pro-Team-winter-socks-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Rapha-Pro-Team-winter-socks-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Rapha-Pro-Team-winter-socks-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Rapha-Pro-Team-winter-socks-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Rapha-Pro-Team-winter-socks-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Rapha-Pro-Team-winter-socks-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Rapha-Pro-Team-winter-socks-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Rapha-Pro-Team-winter-socks-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>RRP: £24 | <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18515&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fgb%2Fen%2Fshop%2Fpro-team-winter-socks%2Fproduct%2FPTK02XX\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>60% merino blend with nylon</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reinforced areas at heel and toes</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wide sizing range from XS to XL to fit EU 35-46+</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The lightweight merino/nylon blend of the Rapha Pro Team Winter Socks has been designed to give thermal insulation for colder weather riding, without adding unnecessary bulk that restricts movement in cycling shoes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are thicker areas around the toe box and the heel cup, which not only give more comfort, but also improve the durability of the socks in these higher wear areas.

This natural fibre, derived from the fleece of a specific breed of sheep, has excellent thermoregulatory properties, helping to keep you warm as well as minimising odour, unlike some synthetic alternatives. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Merino is usually blended with a synthetic fibre to increase durability – especially for items like socks where there’s high wear.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do I need waterproof socks for wet weather winter cycling?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Waterproof socks can be a great idea for certain conditions, but aren’t essential for all wet weather riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Waterproof socks work really well if you’re determined to keep your feet dry when faced with flooded lanes or puddle-ridden gravel tracks, stopping the splash from dampening your ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in warmer conditions they can also be a bit sweaty, as they don’t tend to be as breathable as normal socks, so they can just keep your feet wet from the inside of the sock. You also need to be careful not to let the water drain down your leg into the socks, as it will puddle inside – definitely contenders for socks under bib tights!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Waterproof socks are more specialist and do tend to be considerably more pricey than standard options, so they’re perhaps best saved for the wettest of days.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Should I wear my socks under or over my bib tights?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An age-old question, and one that often triggers a great debate, ultimately the choice to wear your socks over or under your bib tights is down to you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Got a fun, bright pair of socks that you want to show off? Pop ‘em on the outside. Want to go for a more sleek look? Tuck ‘em in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do I need cycling-specific socks for winter riding?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes and no. There are many options for winter socks when it comes to different sport types, and while many of these may be suitable for cycling, do remember that if they are particularly bulky, like some walking socks for example, then this may affect the fit of your cycling shoes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you end up crammed into your cycling shoes with excessively thick socks, then this is likely to have the opposite to the desired effect and actually limit your circulation, so that your feet feel more cold. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many cycling-specific winter socks are designed to add warmth without excessive bulk.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are winter cycling socks the full answer for warm feet?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A leading question – you probably know where this is going. Even with the best winter cycling socks in the world, if you’re still riding in your highly vented summer <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-shoes\" target=\"_blank\">cycling shoes</a> you’re gonna get chilly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most cost-effective way to reduce wind chill on your tootsies is to opt for a pair of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-overshoes\" target=\"_blank\">overshoes </a>to zip on over your existing shoes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re really serious about riding through the worst conditions and your budget allows, consider a pair of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-shoes-for-winter-buyers-guide\" target=\"_blank\">winter cycling shoes</a>, and keep your summer shoes in good nick for when that brighter weather rolls back around.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n
