There are also be some AI features, dubbed Apple Intelligence available on some iPhones (find out if they’ll be on your iPhone below).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This free software update brings interface tweaks, bug fixes, and new features. It is like getting a new iPhone without paying a penny. In this article, we discuss everything you need to know about iOS 18, including which iPhones will be able to run iOS 18, the new features – and the new features still to come because they weren’t ready in time for the launch of iOS 18. We’ll also discuss any problems and fixes, what’s new in the latest update, and what’s coming in the next update to iOS 18.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have information about the beta program including the latest version of the public and developer betas. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Update December 16:</strong> Apple released the first developer beta of iOS 18.3. The iOS 18.3 public beta followed on December 18.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Latest version and what’s new</strong>…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18: Latest version </h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iOS 18.2: December 11, 2024</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>iOS 18 arrived on Monday, September 16. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS Sequoia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362011/watchos-11-watch-faces-fitness-vitals-translate.html\">watchOS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2377675/ipados-18-superguide-features-release.html\">iPadOS 18</a> launched at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest version is iOS 18.2, which arrived on December 11. iOS 18.2 includes a number of Apple Intelligence features but that’s not all.

In notes accompanying the update, Apple writes: “Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited on Intel-based Mac systems.” The fixed issues include a flaw in JavaScriptCore framework and a flaw in WebKit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2412089/ios-18-1-features-fixes-security-release-date-apple-intelligence.html\">iOS 18.1</a> arrived on October 28, and brings the first set of Apple Intelligence features to iPhone 16 models and iPhone 15 Pro and Max. There will be more Apple Intelligence features released in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2499054/ios-18-2-apple-intelligence-siri-genmoji-install-release-beta.html\">iOS 18.2</a> and iOS 18.3.

New features include: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Writing Tools</strong> – Rewrite, proofread, and summarize text. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Siri</strong> – New look.

Spatial photo capture for 16 Pro and Max. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>AirPods</strong> – Hearing Test and Hearing Air features for AirPods Pro 2. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also bug fixes and security updates in iOS 18.1. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s coming…</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18.3: Release date and new features</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iOS 18.3 – expected late January/February</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has started to beta test iOS 18.3. The first developer beta of iOS 18.3 arrived on December 16. The public beta followed on December 18.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Support for robot vacuum cleaners</strong>: The Home app gains support robot vacuum cleaners in the iOS 18.3 beta.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Battery intelligence</strong>: A new framework called “BatteryIntelligence” was discovered hidden in the 18.2 beta, suggesting it will be a feature in iOS 18.3. The feature will calculate the remaining charge time based on the amount of power the phone is receiving. See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2516031/your-iphone-may-finally-tell-you-how-long-it-will-take-to-charge.html\">Your iPhone may finally tell you how long it will take to charge.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other new features in iOS 18.3 are likely to include: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Siri on-device context awareness</strong>: The ability for Siri to give sensible answers based on data found in Messages, Mail, Contacts, and other on-device information.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Siri on-screen awareness</strong>: Siri will be able to see what is on your screen when you ask it to perform a task and take that information into account.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Siri application control</strong>: A big expansion of App Intents, which lets Siri perform actions in your apps. Currently limited to things like playing music or getting directions, there will be hundreds of actions Siri can take in apps. This will start with Apple’s own apps and expand to third-party apps over time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iOS 18: Latest beta </h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iOS 18.3 developer beta 1, December 16. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 18.3 public beta 1, December 18.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s beta testing program for developers and public testers has been running since June/July and continues beyond the launch of iOS 18 to the general public. There is also a separate iOS 18 Sequoia 15.2 beta that includes some as yet unavailable <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence features</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to run the developer beta, you need to be a registered Apple software developer, which has both free and paid ($99/£79) versions. We explain <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html\">How to join Apple’s beta program</a> separately. Developer betas can be risky though, so we recommend signing up for the Public Beta instead, which should be more stable. Beware though: whether a public beta or a developer beta, any beta software is not as stable as the final version and the iOS and your apps may not work properly. Read <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2365614/should-you-install-the-ios-18-beta.html\">Should you install the iOS 18 beta?</a> for advice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once registered, when you go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update on your Mac, you’ll see a new tab for Beta Updates, which will list the version of the beta you’re running: choose either iOS 18 Developer Beta or iOS 18 Public Beta. If you need help installing the developer or public betas read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671198/how-to-install-ios-beta.html\">How to get the iOS beta article</a>. If you then want to uninstall it, we have a guide for that: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1067004/how-to-remove-ios-beta-iphone.html\">How to remove the iOS beta</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18 features still to launch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following promised features aren’t yet in beta: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Advanced Siri features like on-screen awareness, personal context, and actions within apps</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Should you install iOS 18?…</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18: Should I install iOS 18 on my iPhone?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As long as your iPhone can run it, we recommend updating to iOS 18. The new features–all of which we discuss below–look enticing enough, and, so far, the only problem (see above) will not affect many people. We address how <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362183/ios-18-vs-ios-17-differences.html\">How iOS 17 and iOS 18 compare</a> separately. Also take a look at: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2457787/ios-18-all-the-little-details-and-hidden-features-you-wont-want-to-miss.html\">All the little details and hidden features in iOS 18 you won’t want to miss.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we do recommend you wait a week or more so that any issues with the early release can be addressed: despite the beta program, there are often issues once the software update gets installed on mass-market iPhones. It’s also wise not to be one of the first downloaders because the download will likely take a lot longer if you try soon after it becomes available. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18: Problems and bugs</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Messages bug</strong>: A Messages bug that could cause crashes and may even result in the loss of valuable data was reported. It seemed to be connected to an Apple Watch feature that lets users share their watch face over Messages (or Mail). Obviously, those are quite a niche set of circumstances and the best way to avoid it appears to be to not reply to watch faces in a thread. We have more information here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2463540/psa-link-sharing-bug-in-ios-18-messages-can-cause-iphone-crashes-data-loss.html\">Link-sharing bug in iOS 18 Messages can cause iPhone crashes, data loss</a>. Apple fixed this bug in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2477774/apple-releases-ios-and-ipados-18-0-1-to-fix-launch-bugs-and-m4-ipad-support.html\">iOS 18.0.1</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Unresponsive touch screen</strong>: iPhone 16 Pro owners have complained of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2465679/iphone-16-pro-owners-complain-of-display-dead-spots.html\">display ‘dead spots’</a>, with taps and swipes are being ignored. It is thought that this is related to the Camera Control button. Apple addressed this bug in iOS 18.0.1.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Camera freezes in macro mode</strong>: This was addressed in iOS 18.0.1.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Photos redesign</strong>: Probably the most hated feature of iOS 18 is the redesigned Photos app. So we’ve written this: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2547052/hate-the-new-ios-18-photos-app-heres-how-to-fix-it-in-a-few-taps.html\">How to fix the Photos app and make it less annoying</a>. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are concerns that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2483858/macos-sequoias-iphone-mirroring-feature-could-expose-personal-data-at-work.html\">macOS Sequoia’s iPhone mirroring feature could expose personal data at work</a>. Servco Security has highlighted the problem to Apple who claims to be working on a fix. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have any problems with iOS 18 you may be able to downgrade. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2020596/downgrade-iphone-older-version-ios.html\">How to downgrade an iPhone from iOS 18 to iOS 17</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18: How to install</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Installing iOS 18 and any subsequent updates is a breeze. Just open the Settings app on your iPhone and go to General &gt; Software Update; iOS will check for any available updates and guide you through the process of installing them. You simply have to follow the instructions, which we explain in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670944/how-to-update-ios-on-your-iphone.html\">iOS updating guide</a>. And it’s easier still if you’ve turned on Automatic Updates, which you can do from the same screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A little work preparing your iPhone before installing the update can help avoid problems. We advise you follow these steps: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Back up your iPhone</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671444/how-to-back-up-an-iphone-or-ipad.html\">Back up</a> before installing the new version and you will always be able to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672439/how-to-restore-an-iphone-or-ipad-from-an-icloud-or-itunes-backup.html\">recover your iPhone</a> with the older version of iOS running on it should things go wrong. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2020596/downgrade-iphone-older-version-ios.html\">How to downgrade an iPhone</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Make space on your iPhone</strong>: If your iPhone doesn’t have a lot of available space internally we recommend having a bit of a tidy-up so you can <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668286/how-to-free-up-space-on-an-iphone.html\">reclaim some iPhone storage</a>. Simple ways to do this could include deleting apps you don’t use, deleting old Notes, Messages, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673055/how-to-delete-duplicate-photos-on-iphone.html\">duplicated photos</a>. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Update your iPhone to the latest version</strong>: Don’t skip an update and go straight to iOS 18. If you haven’t installed iOS 17.6.1 yet do so now. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18 compatibility: Which iPhones get iOS 18?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following iPhones get support for iOS 18, the same lineup of supported devices as iOS 17. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, Pro, Pro Max </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, Pro, Pro Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, Pro, Pro Max </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, Pro, Pro Max </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, Pro, Pro Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, Pro Max </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone XR</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone SE (2nd gen or later)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2420917/ios-18-compatibility-which-iphones.html\">iOS 18 compatibility: Which iPhones support iOS 18</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1811287/which-version-of-ios-can-my-iphone-run.html\">iOS compatibility checker</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the new features will not be supported on the older phones, because they lack the hardware necessary (a powerful enough Neural Engine or GPU to run AI stuff, or enough RAM). This is typical of new iOS releases. In 2022, for example, the iPhone 8 and iPhone X missed out on a bunch of cool stuff due to their older processor. It is no surprise, therefore, that the hardware requirements are steep for the AI-related features aka ‘Apple Intelligence’—iPhone 15 Pro or later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like iOS 17, iOS 18 does not support iPhone 8 or the iPhone X which came out in 2017, but since those phones are able to run iOS 16, they will continue to get support through security updates for at least another year. With the release of iOS 18 though, Apple will stop supporting iOS 15, which will mean that iPhone 7, 7 Plus, iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, and iPhone SE (1st generation) will no longer get support. Generally, Apple has provided software updates for the past two versions of iOS. See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675021/how-long-does-apple-support-iphones.html\">How long does Apple support iPhones</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iOS 18 guide</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18 features: What’s new in iOS 18</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There were many new features in iOS 17 including a new app called Journal, Live Voicemail, and a new way to use Stickers, among dozens of other smaller changes. Rumors suggested that iOS 18 would be “one of the biggest iOS updates — if not the biggest — in the company’s history.” As expected, in iOS 28 Apple will include some major new AI features, dubbed Apple Intelligence, although these features will only be available on iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max and newer iPhones.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all the new features were available at launch. The first <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2413704/apple-intelligence-features-ios-18-1-beta-available-coming-later.html\">Apple Intelligence AI features</a> were introduced in iOS 18.1 and others are arriving with subsequent updates. Features, such as the new categories in Mail, will come “later this year”.

Prior to iOS 18 icons can be reordered or put into folders, but always fill the screen from left to right and top to bottom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In iOS 18 users are able to arrange apps and widgets anywhere on the Home Screen, including right above the dock or framing a wallpaper. It will even be possible to change the lock screen icons or remove them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, App icons and widgets can have a dark or tinted effect to blend in.

It’s the biggest redesign of Photos ever and is intended to help users find photos fast.

Apple Intelligence will only be supported by iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, and the iPhone 16 range though. (<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2365423/apple-intelligence-cpu-vs-memory-8gb-minimum.html\">Here’s why you’ll need to upgrade your iPhone to get Apple Intelligence</a>, also read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2365423/apple-intelligence-cpu-memory-neural-engine-private-cloud-compute.html\">Here’s why newer iPhones and Vision Pro can’t run Apple Intelligence</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hardware requirements are steep—iPhone 15 Pro or later. iPads will need at least an M1 chip or later as will Macs. Apple Intelligence features will mostly be processed on the device, which is different from other platforms where AI processing is done in the cloud. But Apple Intelligence will be able to determine if cloud processing is needed and will use it when appropriate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Intelligence features include the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Writing</strong> – Apple Intelligence will help users enhance their writing and communications. Writing Tools are built in systemwide that will offer to rewrite, proofread, and summarize text in writing focused apps such as Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Images</strong> – New image capabilities will also come to M-series Macs. In Image Playground users will be able to create images in three styles: Animation, Illustration, or Sketch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Photos</strong> – A new Memories in Photos feature will create a video from photos and videos based on a description provided by the user. Apple Intelligence will pick out the photos and videos, develop a storyline based on the photos, and arrange them into a movie. In addition, a new Clean Up tool will identify and remove unwanted objects from the background of a photo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence FAQ: What it is, what it does, and when you’ll get it</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369986/apple-intelligence-siri-features-coming-after-ios-18-launch.html\">Apple Intelligence is a gradual rollout—here’s what you’ll get, and when</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Siri</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Siri is also getting some AI updates and ChatGPT is to be integrated into Siri (as of iOS 18.2). Because some queries will be handled off-device Apple is introducing Private Cloud Compute so that when data is sent to server-based models for processing it is not stored or made accessible to Apple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the simplest changes to Siri is that it will be easier to type to Siri rather than having to speak to the on-device assistant. Apple may have finally twigged that people don’t always want to talk to their phones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Siri is said to be more “conversational” and natural, with features that “help users in their day-to-day lives.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new smart responses framework will help Siri take into account your own personal details in its replies: like people, companies, calendar events, locations, dates, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later this year, Siri is said to get cross-device media control. So you can talk to Siri on one of your devices to control media playback on another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an update scheduled for early 2025, Siri is said to gain the ability to control nearly any app, with hundreds of possible commands. This feature will start off with single commands for Apple’s own apps and grow to include third-party apps and commands with multiple steps. In addition, Siri will be able to react to and take actions based on what is on your screen. This is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q\">said to go into beta for developers in January</a>, with a rollout to users in iOS 18.4 in the spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New accessibility features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is planning <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2334546/apple-to-bring-eye-tracking-vocal-shortcuts-music-haptics-and-more-accessibility-features-to-iphone-and-ipad.html\">several new accessibility features for iOS 18</a>, including Adaptive Voice Shortcuts, which will let users turn on or off specific accessibility features using a custom phrase, and Live Speech, which lets users type what they want to say and have it read out loud on phone calls or video meetings, will get the ability to add saved phrases to categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Features that arrived or are arriving later</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some iOS 18 features won’t be a part of the initial release. Rather, they will be released later in 2024 or in 2025 as part of an iOS 18 point release (iOS 18.2 or iOS 18.4, for example).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the more significant features <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2365756/ios-18-features-not-available-at-launch.html\">coming in later iOS 18 updates</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mail app features –</strong> Auto-categorizing of mail, mail digests, and summaries in your inbox. (Arrived in iOS 18.2)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Home support for robot vacuums –</strong> The Home app won’t be able to start or stop your Roomba until 2025. (Coming in iOS 18.3).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Drag and Drop between iPhone and Mac –</strong> You’ll be able to see and control your iPhone on your Mac when iOS 18 and macOS 15 are released, but drag-and-drop support between your Mac and iPhone will come in an update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ChatGPT integration –</strong> The ability to call upon ChatGPT when using Apple’s AI tools arrived in iOS 18.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advanced Siri features –</strong> Siri features like its ability to see and react to what is on your display, semantic indexing (where Siri knows and uses information from across Messages, Mail, Contacts, and more), and advanced control over apps is all coming in 2025. (Coming in 2025).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2405722/ios-18-how-to-vehicle-motion-cues-reduce-motion-sickness.html\">Vehicle Motion Cues</a> in iOS 18 will help reduce motion sickness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Third-party NFC transactions</strong> – Apple will allow <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2427556/apple-will-allow-third-party-nfc-transactions-beginning-with-ios-18-1-by-request.html\">third-party NFC transactions</a> beginning with iOS 18.1–by request.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, all of the Apple Intelligence features will initially support only American English, and may be limited to only some regions. Additional languages and regions are coming later, the U.K., Australia and Canada gained supposed at the end of 2024, other regions will gain support through 2025 and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Next version of iOS </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that the next version of iOS after Apple finishes development of iOS 18 will be iOS 19. But what next in terms of software? Expect even more Apple Intelligence features to come in the late 2025 update to iOS and expect that iOS, iPadOS and macOS will be closer than ever. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past several years, the release of the new version of iOS has been fairly consistent, usually falling on the Monday following Apple’s iPhone launch event:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iOS 18: Monday, September 16, 2024</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 17: Monday, September 18, 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 16: Monday, September 12, 2022 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 15: Monday, September 20, 2021 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 14: Wednesday, September 16, 2020</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 13: Thursday, September 19, 2019</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 12: Monday, September 17, 2018</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"dcfb38ef5674b7a3553c0676f9cc936392cb8181385ae3021fe0553a9ac410f9","category":"Apple"}
