Please arrive early, massive\ncrowds expected. March to the Capitol after. Stop the Steal!!”\nTrump wrote in the draft tweet, which is undated.</p>\n\n<p>Trump never sent the tweet, but its existence, along with other\nmessages exchanged between rally organizers, offer proof that\nthe march to the Capitol was premeditated, the January 6\ncommittee said.</p>\n\n<p>Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida presented the evidence\nduring Tuesday’s hearing, and said: “The evidence confirms that\nthis was not a spontaneous call to action, but rather it was a\ndeliberate strategy decided upon in advance by the president.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unsent draft tweets seem the most likely target <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/08/trump_dms\">of the January 6 special counsel subpoena</a> — and it’s possible that Twitter saves everything each user has ever typed in the tweet-editing field.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/15/trump-unsent-draft-tweets\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0ab8b49df95ae98923942d4f758a2f8f7beb059a9a94c800db1e6bc62fc76a29","category":"Tech"}
