Research has shown they can cooperate, teach each other new skills, and even recognize themselves in a mirror. For decades, scientists have attempted to make sense of the complex collection of whistles and clicks dolphins use to communicate. Researchers might make a little headway on that front soon with the help of Google's open AI model and some Pixel phones.</p>\n<p>Google has been finding ways to work generative AI into everything else it does, so why not its collaboration with the Wild Dolphin Project (WDP)? This group has been studying dolphins since 1985 using a non-invasive approach to track a specific community of Atlantic spotted dolphins. The WDP creates video and audio recordings of dolphins, along with correlating notes on their behaviors.</p>\n<p>One of the WDP's main goals is to analyze the way dolphins vocalize and how that can affect their social interactions. With decades of underwater recordings, researchers have managed to connect some basic activities to specific sounds. For example, Atlantic spotted dolphins have signature whistles that appear to be used like names, allowing two specific individuals to find each other. They also consistently produce \"squawk\" sound patterns during fights.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/google-created-a-new-ai-model-for-talking-to-dolphins/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/google-created-a-new-ai-model-for-talking-to-dolphins/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ba4f5fc6079d0b5ec83d0d1ac05d19fbcef9506e30e2f8699e8764593bd84346","category":"Tech"}
