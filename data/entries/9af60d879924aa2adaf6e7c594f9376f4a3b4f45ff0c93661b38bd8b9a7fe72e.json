While it is unclear when this could occur, the timing of the news coinciding with Apple's \"It's Glowtime\" <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> Apple event later today suggests that the move could be imminent.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's EarPods were first introduced in 2012 as the standard earphones bundled with iPhones and iPods, replacing the earlier circular earbuds. Initially, the EarPods were equipped with a standard 3.5mm headphone jack, but with the launch of the ‌iPhone‌ 7 and the introduction of AirPods in 2016, Apple started removing the headphone jack from its devices. A new version of the EarPods were released simultaneously with a Lightning connector to match the new ‌iPhone‌'s only remaining port. Last year, with the switch to USB-C on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> lineup, Apple introduced a third revision of the EarPods with a USB-C connector. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarPods have seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years owing to their excellent microphone and low price point, so their discontinuation would likely disappoint many fans of the inexpensive earbuds.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earpods/\">EarPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-may-discontinue-earpods/\">After 14 Years, Apple May Finally Discontinue EarPods</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/after-14-years-apple-may-finally-discontinue-earpods.2435425/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9af60d879924aa2adaf6e7c594f9376f4a3b4f45ff0c93661b38bd8b9a7fe72e","category":"Apple"}
