In a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/23/iphone-15-pro-solid-state-buttons-hint/\">shareholder letter last November</a>, the Texas-based company said it had continued to \"engage with a strategic customer\" and expected to \"bring a new HPMS component to market in smartphones next year.\" Apple is Cirrus Logic's largest customer and accounted for 79% of its revenue in the 2022 fiscal year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn an investor note today, Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis and Tom O'Malley said Cirrus Logic's aforementioned comments likely refer to the solid-state buttons. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo initially said iPhone 15 Pro models would have been equipped with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/28/kuo-iphone-15-pro-models-solid-state-buttons/\">two additional Taptic Engines</a> that provided haptic feedback when the solid-state buttons were pressed, and Cirrus Logic likely would have provided related components.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast month, Kuo said iPhone 15 Pro models would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/11/kuo-iphone-15-pro-no-solid-state-buttons-after-all/\">no longer have solid-state buttons</a> as initially rumored due to \"unresolved technical issues before mass production.\" He now expects the devices to have traditional buttons that move when pressed. Rumors suggest the Ring/Silent switch will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/26/iphone-15-pro-action-button-cads/\">still be be replaced with a button</a> as previously claimed, and this button could be customizable like the Action button on the Apple Watch Ultra.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple analyst Jeff Pu believes the solid-state buttons will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/12/iphone-16-pro-solid-state-buttons/\">likely be pushed back to iPhone 16 Pro models</a> launching next year, but Cirrus Logic's comments today suggest that the supplier has no knowledge of these plans as of yet.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cirrus-logic/\">Cirrus Logic</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/05/iphone-15-pro-solid-state-buttons-cancellation/\">Apple Supplier Seemingly Confirms iPhone 15 Pro Solid-State Buttons Cancellation</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-supplier-seemingly-confirms-iphone-15-pro-solid-state-buttons-cancellation.2388715/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a7bd190dec72f15ae1e564c84a1d83a5dc4c666b19978716a213eb9071d03bc3","category":"Apple"}
