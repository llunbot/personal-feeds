Hansen is also an incredible polymath, making his own carbon shoes (which weigh 76g) and writing bespoke software for his Lotto team’s logistics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His current day job is as president of the CPA – the <em>Cyclistes Professionels Associés</em>, which represents most pro riders. He’s also a staunch vegan who can go as deep as you want on why it should be the athlete’s diet of choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can imagine, Hansen is a font of knowledge and stories, so to tide you over in these festive times, we thought we’d give you an extended episode. We loved talking to him and hope you like it. Merry Christmas!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more on Adam Hansen’s custom shoes and clothing, check out <a href=\"https://hanseeno.myshopify.com/\" target=\"_blank\">hanseeno.myshopify.com</a> and for his wearable tech that analyses pedalling and running form, check out <a href=\"https://www.leomo.io/\" target=\"_blank\">leomo.io</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our chat begins at 4:52.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes/94-adam-hansen-20-back-to-back-grand-tours-and-president-of-\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 94 now on Acast</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\">all episodes</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know Cyclist is also a stunning monthly magazine?
