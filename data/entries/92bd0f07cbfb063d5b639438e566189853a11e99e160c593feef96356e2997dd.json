While officially the GT stands for ‘Grand Tourers’, we can’t help but think it’s remarkably suggestive of a certain Welshman’s initials…</p>\n<h2>Divisive look</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Geraint Thomas wearing SunGod GT glasses at the 2023 Giro d'Italia\" title=\"Geraint Thomas wearing SunGod GT glasses at the 2023 Giro d'Italia\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 2018 Tour de France winner seems happy about his new signature shades.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stuart Franklin / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>It’s fair to say the new model is a bit divisive in its design. Two-lens, full-frame specs have gradually disappeared from the pro peloton and even club rides.</p>\n<p>That said, Thomas’ new eyewear manages to tread the retro line well. Rather than looking as though they’re from the 1990s, like Oakley’s Racing Jackets, the GTs’ sharp angles put a modern spin on the design format.</p>\n<p>Throw in the fact that SunGod didn’t have something similar in its performance-focused Pace range, and it’s easy to see why it was happy to accept Thomas’ requests for his signature set.</p>\n<h2>3D printing</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Prototypes of SunGod GT sunglasses\" title=\"Prototypes of SunGod GT sunglasses\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> SunGod has been using 3D printing to develop the new GT sunglasses.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Charlie Allenby / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A pair of sunglasses usually takes nine months to develop, according to SunGod, and is then further refined during testing and sampling before going on general sale.</p>\n<p>SunGod’s head of product, Ed Watkiss, started his first drawings of the GTs in the second week of January and was given a hard deadline for the Giro d’Italia team presentation on 4 May.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Development drawing of SunGodd GT sunglasses\" title=\"Development drawing of SunGodd GT sunglasses\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 3D printing enabled SunGod to turn around prototypes in three days.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Charlie Allenby / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Enter 3D printing. A growing trend within the production of cycling products, the process enabled Watkiss to create physical iterations quickly at all stages of the GTs’ development, with a printing bureau able to turn around each new phase within three days.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t just for development, either. The first pair Thomas was seen sporting at this year’s Giro was, in fact, a 3D-printed prototype.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Prototypes of SunGod GT sunglasses\" title=\"Prototypes of SunGod GT sunglasses\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The initial 3D-printed prototype frames were switched for a production sample during the first rest day.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Charlie Allenby / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The glasses’ development has continued during the Giro itself, and Thomas is now on his third different model as the race has progressed.</p>\n<p>The initial 3D-printed prototype frames were switched for a fully moulded production sample with polycarbonate lenses during the first rest day, while a pair featuring 8KO nylon lenses now take pride of place on the Welsh rider’s face.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the actual release’s frame will be produced using a recycled TR90 plastic polymer. Lightweight and durable, according to Watkiss, he expects the GTs to weigh in at roughly 32g.</p>\n<h2>Super-sharp lenses</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Geraint Thomas wearing SunGod GT glasses at the 2023 Giro d'Italia\" title=\"Geraint Thomas wearing SunGod GT glasses at the 2023 Giro d'Italia\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Welshman’s iconic look is back… kind of.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tim de Waele / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>A pair of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-glasses-for-cycling/\">best cycling sunglasses</a> is only as good as its lenses, and this is another area where SunGod hopes to make a distinctive break from Thomas’ old staples.</p>\n<p>Rather than the industry-standard polycarbonate lenses used by Oakley, the Verbier-based brand has chosen 8KO nylon instead.</p>\n<p>The reason? Clarity, according to SunGod. The claim is 8KO nylon lenses have a significantly better (up to 70 per cent) Abbe value (how much light is distorted when it passes through a material) than traditional polycarbonate lenses. Ultimately, the idea is that it should improve vision on the road.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Geraint Thomas wearing SunGod GT glasses at the 2023 Giro d'Italia\" title=\"Geraint Thomas wearing SunGod GT glasses at the 2023 Giro d'Italia\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s one colour for sunglasses as far as Geraint Thomas is concerned: white and white only.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stuart Franklin / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>In practice, it was certainly something we noticed when out testing another pair of SunGods that features the technology during our time in Verbier.</p>\n<p>Visibility remained crystal-clear, whether we were in sunny or overcast conditions, and even handled the dark settings of mountain tunnels well, too.</p>\n<p>The GTs’ lenses will be interchangeable, enabling you to switch to your preferred setup depending on that day’s conditions.</p>\n<h2>Pricing and availability</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Geraint Thomas wearing SunGod GT glasses at the 2023 Giro d'Italia\" title=\"Geraint Thomas wearing SunGod GT glasses at the 2023 Giro d'Italia\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> White is the only colour for Thomas’ glasses.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Luca Bettini / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>The new SunGod GTs will be available for pre-order soon and initially only in the Geraint Thomas signature colourway – with a white frame, red arms and blue lenses.</p>\n<p>The brand plans to launch more colour options in summer 2024.</p>","author":"Charlie Allenby","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"92bd0f07cbfb063d5b639438e566189853a11e99e160c593feef96356e2997dd","category":"Cycling"}
