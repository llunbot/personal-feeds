While the company still made $81.8 billion in the period, that represented a 1 percent decline over last year’s Q3 results, and all major product categories—iPhone, iPad, and Mac—were down as well. While revenue was down, an increase in margin means that <em>profit</em> was up to $19.9 billion from $19.4 billion in the year-ago quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lone bright spot was Services, which posted a year-over-year jump of 8 percent to an all-time record of $21.21 billion, higher than Mac, iPad, and Wearables/Home/Accessories combined. The iPhone is still Apple’s largest category by far, raking in just under $40 billion in the quarter. Here’s how Apple’s quarter broke down:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone: $39.7B (Down 2 percent)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad: $5.8B (Down 20 percent)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac: $6.8B (Down 7 percent)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wearables/Home: $8.3B (Up 2 percent)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Services: $21.2 billion (Up 8 percent)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In a press release, Apple said it has more than a billion paid subscriptions, though it’s not clear how many subscribers each of Apple’s individual services have, including TV+ and Music. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>CEO Tim Cook said in a conference call that the June quarter was a record for iPhone switchers and CFO Luca Maestri reported that Mac, iPad, and Watch had “high new-to” rates. Cook also noted that “the timing of the iPad Air launch last year” was largely responsible for the year-over-year dip.</p>\n\nApple Inc</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"fa4693961e0e2cc82deee174521ec826db4b3a5d7e524becd8ba2cb5c342e9f5","category":"Apple"}
