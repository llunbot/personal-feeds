It capped off a successful eight days for SD Worx, who won four stages through four different riders – Kopecky, Lorena Wiebes, Vollering and Marlen Reusser. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it wasn’t always straightforward for the team with one incident resulting in Vollering getting docked 20 seconds and one <em>directeur sportif </em>(DS) getting thrown from the race. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defending champion Annemiek van Vleuten (Movistar) was disappointed with her result, finishing off the podium in fourth at her final Tour de France, but stage wins by teammates Liane Lippert and Emma Norsgaard meant all was not lost. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was much to talk about outside the GC battle, including Fenix-Deceuninck’s attacking display, leading to multiple combativity awards including the overall combativity title, brief ownership of the polka dot jersey and a spectacular stage win. Let’s recap another thrilling Tour de France Femmes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Highs, lows and highs again for SD Worx</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/GettyImages-1565390151-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cyclists in green and yellow posing on street\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/GettyImages-1565390151-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/GettyImages-1565390151-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/GettyImages-1565390151-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/GettyImages-1565390151-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/GettyImages-1565390151-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/GettyImages-1565390151-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/GettyImages-1565390151-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/GettyImages-1565390151-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/GettyImages-1565390151-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/GettyImages-1565390151-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Jeff Pachoud/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>SD Worx arrived at the Tour de France Femmes in stellar form, having already notched up a raft of big wins and multiple 1-2 podium finishes this season. Their line-up included yellow jersey contender Vollering, time-trial crusher and Tour de Suisse winner Reusser, sprint specialist Wiebes and Classics powerhouse Kopecky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the first stage into Clermont-Ferrand was expected to be a sprint finish for Wiebes, it was Kopecky who rolled the dice, breaking away over the only climb of the day to claim a solo victory. SD Worx being SD Worx, Wiebes still led the bunch home and finished in second place 41 seconds behind to start the race with a 1-2. Wiebes later won the only bunch sprint of the race on Stage 3 ahead before dropping out with illness a couple of days later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn’t all perfect for the team. Vollering would probably want to forget Stage 4, in which she celebrated second place believing she had won. Stage 5 – a 126km day over three climbs – was never expected to be a big talking point for the GC contenders, but quickly became so thanks to SD Worx directeur sportif Danny Stam. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Vollering chasing back on following a puncture, the SD Worx team car – driven by Stam – gave her a pull back to the peloton. Although that’s technically illegal, it’s mostly tolerated by race officials provided it’s within reason. Stam then started dangerously overtaking other team cars in the convoy at speed. A commissaire blew their whistle repeatedly, moving up to the car window on a motorbike and shaking their finger to hammer the point home. Vollering moved out from behind the car and used another to push her way back up to the group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the stage Vollering received a 20-second time penalty, while Stam was excluded from the race and fined 500 Swiss francs. The UCI said the TV footage ‘clearly shows the particularly dangerous nature of Mr Stam’s overtaking of other cars and riders during Stage 5 of the event’. Stam’s public questioning of the commissaires’ competency didn’t help his case either. Either way, it was a less than ideal disruption before the anticipated showdown in the mountains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not that it would hamper Vollering though, who shone in the fog on Stage 7. Like a shark choosing the perfect moment to pounce on its prey, she rode away from the group on the Col du Tourmalet and hunted down lone leader Niewiadoma. Weather conditions on the mountain obscured the view of riders’ pain and suffering, but one thing that could be seen was how much distance being put between Vollering and her rivals. She arrived at the summit finish almost two minutes ahead of Niewiadoma to take the yellow jersey with just one time-trial standing between her and glory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a true stamping of authority, SD Worx finished their Tour de France Femmes with a 1-2-3 finish on Stage 8. The 22.6km individual time-trial was won by European TT champion Reusser with Vollering and Kopecky behind her. Kopecky’s revelatory performance on the Tourmalet and strong time-trial meant she finished second behind Vollering in the general classification too – a triumphant result that far surpassed expectations. Given that the race only saw SD Worx riders wearing the yellow jersey and was bookended by 1-2 successes, it’s safe to say the team’s plan SD Worxed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Movistar and a changing of the guard</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230728TDFFAZ0054-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"two cyclists celebrating in each others' faces\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230728TDFFAZ0054-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230728TDFFAZ0054-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230728TDFFAZ0054-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230728TDFFAZ0054-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230728TDFFAZ0054-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230728TDFFAZ0054-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230728TDFFAZ0054-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230728TDFFAZ0054-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230728TDFFAZ0054-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux.jpg 1500w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Two of the most surprising things that happened in the Tour de France Femmes: Annemiek van Vleuten not finishing on the podium and neither of Movistar’s two stage victories coming from her. After announcing she’ll at the end of the 2023 season, Van Vleuten had an uncharacteristically quiet start to her final professional cycling season. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She picked up steam just in time for La Vuelta Femenina however, winning her third consecutive Grand Tour general classification, though without taking a stage. It was at the Giro d’Italia Donne that Van Vleuten looked to be back to Van Vleutening, victorious on three stages and securing the overall, mountains and points classifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arriving at the Tour de France Femmes shortly after, all eyes were on Van Vleuten’s potential to secure the triple. Or, technically, the double triple, since she swept the three biggest stage races in 2022 as well. While SD Worx were annexing the <em>maillot jaune</em>, facing a 20-second time penalty and having a DS excluded, Movistar’s first half of the race was a quiet affair in terms of the GC. A perfect opportunity for other riders to shine then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liane Lippert out-punched a yellow jersey-wearing Lotte Kopecky on the Stage 2 finale up to Mauriac and was a picture of jubilation as she crossed the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another opportunity presented itself on Stage 6, a relatively flat 122km run towards Blagnac. Sprinter Emma Norsgaard worked her way into the breakaway and the gap climbed to two minutes on the peloton. A familiar, gripping situation reared its head in the final kilometres. Sprinters’ teams attempted to reel in the breakaway, who were still giving it their all to stay away and avoid a heartbreaking catch just before the line. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final two survivors, Norsgaard and Agnieszka Skalniak-Sójka (Canyon-SRAM), navigated the final technical corners and tram lines with precision and into the final 500m, the duo began to sprint. Skalniak-Sójka was absorbed by the speeding mass, but Norsgaard managed to cling on by a second second to beat the field and celebrate her first Tour de France Femmes stage victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two brilliant stage victories for Movistar before the expected fight on the Tourmalet and Van Vleuten graciously acknowledged her teammates’ sacrifices. Speaking after Norsgaard’s Stage 6 win, she said, ‘Riding with me in a team is not always easy because sometimes they don’t get opportunities. So, I also feel a bit guilty sometimes that they have to sacrifice their own ambitions… today [Norsgaard] finished it off. Wow, that gives me goosebumps. This Tour for us is already a success.’<strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following day came the Col du Tourmalet. The issue with expectations is that sometimes they don’t become reality. We’re used to seeing Van Vleuten inflicting pain on others and adding to her enormous <em>palmarès </em>with the ease of a Sunday café ride. She is a champion of cycling that has been in this game for a long, long time with a commanding dominance that could inflate an ego to the size of a hot air balloon… and yet, she is always respectful and appreciative of her competitors and teammates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Vollering was chasing down Niewiadoma on the Tourmalet though, Van Vleuten was struggling behind. Her sunglasses cast away, the pain was etched across her face for all to see before the blanket of fog shrouded the revelation of her humanity. She placed third on the stage, crossing the line 2:34 behind Vollering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked about her feelings after the final stage, having finished fourth overall, Van Vleuten said, ‘Disappointment. I wasn’t good the last two days. I was in the battle and I gave it my all. I didn’t make any mistake that I can think of. I don’t know what happened. I was not myself and that’s a bit sad in my last Tour de France. How I was riding on the Tourmalet, I think people that watch more women’s cycling will know that isn’t my normal level.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a surprising disappointment for Van Vleuten, but she was again full of praise for her Movistar teammates and the two victories for Lippert and Norsgaard. It’s not how she wanted to finish her final Tour de France Femmes and not how most fans wanted to see her go, but all good things must come to an end. It’s slightly strange to think of a peloton without Van Vleuten dominating. Her era of success has been remarkable, but now it’s time for other riders to shine.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2023\">The best photos from the Tour de France Femmes 2023</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/demi-vollering-bike-specialized-sworks-tarmac-sl7-tour-de-france-femmes\">Demi Vollering’s Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL7: Tour de France Femmes bike gallery</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/annemiek-van-vleuten-bike-canyon-aeroad-tour-de-france-femmes\">Annemiek van Vleuten’s Canyon Aeroad CFR: Tour de France Femmes bike gallery</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/uci-road-cycling-world-championships-route-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Glasgow UCI Cycling World Championships 2023: Key information</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>3.

While the race is one of the longest and most prestigious for the women’s peloton, eight stages still feels like a small window for the smaller teams to work their magic. Despite this, Fenix-Deceuninck lit up the race, especially thanks to Julie Van de Velde and Yara Kastelijn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between them, Van de Velde and Kastelijn spent a combined four days in the polka dot jersey and both received a stage combativity award. Kastelijn also won from the breakaway on Stage 4 and took home the super-combativity award at the end of the race, a deserved reward for all her entertaining efforts that had the team celebrating on the podium together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s plenty more I could write about, from Niewiadoma’s phenomenal performance on Stage 7 to secure third overall and the mountains classification, or her teammate Ricarda Bauernfeind becoming the youngest winner of a Tour de France Femmes stage, or how Veronica Ewers of EF Education-Tibco-SVB finished Stage 6 with a broken collarbone, or how Cédrine Kerbaol wore the young riders’ jersey for the entire race, or…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get it. There are so many stories to be told about the Tour de France Femmes that I wish I could condense them all. But in short, it was another phenomenal edition of a race that is here to stay (and long may it remain in the calendar), with a solid groundwork to grow further.
