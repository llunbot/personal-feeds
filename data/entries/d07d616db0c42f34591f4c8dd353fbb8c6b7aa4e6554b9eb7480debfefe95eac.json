{"title":"The Browser Company Is Building a Swift Development Toolchain for Windows","link":"https://twitter.com/hursh/status/1653427830330368001","date":1683081873000,"content":"\n<p>Hursh Agrawal, cofounder of The Browser Company (makers of the upstart browser <a href=\"https://arc.net/\">Arc</a>, which for now is Mac-only):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We’re sprinting hard to get Arc onto Windows in 2023 — exact timing still 🤐!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>His tweet has a two-minute video that outlines a tremendously ambitious plan:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Swift on Windows (compiler, debugger)</li>\n<li>VSCode integration, Swift bindings for WinAppSDK</li>\n<li>Porting Arc to Windows</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If they pull it off, they’ll ship a toolchain to develop cross-platform Mac/Windows apps, programmed in Swift using VSCode. I have my doubts about whether this is possible from a small team, and I have different doubts about whether this would be a good way to write good Mac apps. So I’d ignore this for now — <em>but</em> for the fact that Arc itself is very interesting, and very much real.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not for me, but it really has a bunch of innovative, original ideas for a web browser. They’ve proven that they can ship. So I say godspeed.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/02/browser-company-swift-windows\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d07d616db0c42f34591f4c8dd353fbb8c6b7aa4e6554b9eb7480debfefe95eac","category":"Tech"}
