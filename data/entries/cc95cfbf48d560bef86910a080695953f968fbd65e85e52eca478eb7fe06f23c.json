Sure, the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-impressions-riding-pivot-switchblade-29-27-5-moabs-best-trails/\" target=\"_blank\">Slickrock</a> is still just as impressive and awe-inspiring, but the town itself is hard to recognize. Thanks to an explosion of outdoor recreation for everything from trail running to side by sides, Moab has seen huge growth in tourism – and with that, the need for more hotel rooms. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-18-800x1067.jpg\" alt=\"Field Station Moab\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-18-800x1067.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-18-225x300.jpg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-18-90x120.jpg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-18-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-18-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-18.jpg 1500w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-01-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Field Station Moab lobby\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-01-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-01-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-01.jpg 2000w\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-02-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Field Station Moab shop\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-02-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-02-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-02-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-02-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-02.jpg 2000w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-03-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Field Station Moab shop\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-03-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-03-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-03-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-03-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-03-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-03.jpg 2000w\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While many of the hotels you’ll find in Moab are the typical uninspired chain hotels you could find in any city, there are a few new options in town that specifically cater to adventurers. Field Station Moab is exactly that. A base of operations for red rock adventures, Field Station is uniquely equipped to help you make the most out of your visit to Moab. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walk in the front door, and instead of a boring lobby, you’re greeted by an impressively complete gear shop full of last-minute necessities. Forgot ride food or hydration? An extra layer? First aid kit? They have all that and more. If you’re in need of bigger items like, you know, a bike, the rental counter probably has you covered there too. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-11-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Little Station food and coffee bar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-11-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-11-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-11-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-11-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-11-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-11.jpg 2000w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-09-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Field Station Moab exterior \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-09-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-09-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-09-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-09-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-09-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-09.jpg 2000w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-08-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Field Station Moab exterior fire pit and pool\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-08-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-08-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-08-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-08-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-08-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-08.jpg 2000w\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside you’ll also find the Little Station Coffee + Kitchen that serves breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner with plenty of drink options. It opens out to a spacious back patio with plenty of outdoor seating and a fire pit next to the pool (and hot tub). Our trip got kind of sideways and the weather didn’t allow us to spend much time pool or fireside, but it looked inviting when we arrived. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>No need to search for water</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-12-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Field Station Moab Lobby details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-12-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-12-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-12-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-12-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-12-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-12.jpg 2000w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-10-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Field Station Moab Lobby details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-10-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-10-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-10-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-10-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-10-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-10.jpg 2000w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-13-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Field Station Moab Lobby details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-13-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-13-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-13-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-13-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-13-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-13.jpg 2000w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-14-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Field Station Moab Lobby details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-14-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-14-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-14-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-14-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-14-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-14.jpg 2000w\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best amenities on offer? The free water bottle (or hydration pack) filler in the lobby. Seriously, why is this not a thing in every hotel? No need to wander around hoping to find a water jug in the gym on the sixth floor. Just stop by the filler on your way out for an adventure – Moab is quite dry after all, so drink up. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Guest Room Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\"

you’ll also find outdoor inspiration indoors. We ended up in a Double Queen + Bunk room, which is listed at 6 people max. Inside the room, there are signs of the building’s former life as a tired Super 8 in the desert like windows that don’t quite seal and overworked air conditioners, but the experience was for the majority a positive one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Realistically, this room would be great for four friends who each want their own bed, or 8 if you don’t mind going two people to a queen bed. For bigger groups of riding buddies that would probably be crashing in the same room anyway, this is a pretty luxe way to go about it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside the cleanly decorated room, there was a Dometic cooler, camp chairs, and camp blankets to provide an outdoorsy feel while being perfectly functional indoors. More importantly, there was a bike stand showing that Field Station <em>expects</em> you to bring your bike inside. Just realize that there is no elevator for the two-floor hotel, so you’ll have to carry your bike and gear up the relatively short steps (along the same lines, if stairs are an issue, make sure to request a room on the first floor). Also, since we stayed there, they’ve updated the website to mention checking at the front desk for a bike cover prior to bringing your bike into the room – likely to try and keep things as clean as possible inside. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Moab Vanlife Parking Options</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-04-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Field Station Vanlife post\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-04-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-04-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-04-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-04-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-04-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-04.jpg 2000w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-06-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Field Station Vanlife post\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-06-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-06-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-06-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-06-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-06-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-06.jpg 2000w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-07-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Field Station Vanlife post\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-07-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-07-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-07-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-07-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-07-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-07.jpg 2000w\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who don’t need a hotel because they have a sweet van will also find a spot at Field Station. Literally. Vanlifers can rent spots just outside of the pool which include power hookups, shower &amp; pool access, wifi, and the all-important bike wash station for just $29 per day, year ’round. We spoke to a couple who had just stayed at Field Station in one of the Van Life Posts and said they would definitely stay there again. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bike Cleaning Station</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-05-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Field Station Bike wash\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-05-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-05-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-05-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-05-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-05-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-05.jpg 2000w\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>During our stay, I put the bike wash station to use during a thunderstorm which meant a very quick wash. Under normal conditions, there are also tools available so you can work on your bike if needed (while not dodging lightning). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Located just up the road from Arches National Park, Field Station’s location means you don’t have to deal with downtown Moab traffic unless you want to check out the restaurants and shops. <a href=\"https://lovemuffincafe.com\">Love Muffin</a> is a must, though they’re not open Wednesday and Thursday, so plan ahead. <a href=\"https://www.moabgarageco.com\" target=\"_blank\">Moab Garage Co.</a> is another great spot for breakfast or lunch, and I had some amazing sushi at <a href=\"https://www.sabakusushi.com/visit\">Sabaku</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-15-800x1067.jpg\" alt=\"Learn rock climbing knots \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-15-800x1067.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-15-225x300.jpg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-15-90x120.jpg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-15-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-15-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Field-Station-Moab-hotel-review-mountain-bike-adventure-15.jpg 1500w\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Learn your knots, and where to go</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you find yourself in Moab and not sure what to do, Field Station also offers curated Experiences which include guided mountain bike tours, climbing, canyoneering, and rockaneering trips, and even complimentary Mappy Morning trip planning sessions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it’s your first trip to Moab, or you’re a seasoned red rock adventurer, Field Station Moab seems to have something for everyone. It’s one of those rare hotels which can actually enhance your adventures, rather than simply providing a place to stay. You get that too, but you seem to get a whole lot more – which is worth the price of admission. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.fieldstation.com\" target=\"_blank\">fieldstation.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/field-station-moab-is-the-perfect-slickrock-base-camp-hotel-or-vanlife-docking-station/\">Field Station Moab is the Perfect Slickrock Base Camp Hotel or Vanlife Docking Station</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"cc95cfbf48d560bef86910a080695953f968fbd65e85e52eca478eb7fe06f23c","category":"Cycling"}
