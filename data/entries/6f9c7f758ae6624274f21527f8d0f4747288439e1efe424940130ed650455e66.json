A \"dead\" e-bike battery may only have two or three truly dead cells inside, while the remainder work fine. This is useful knowledge that, for the most part, very few e-bike owners can really use. Arc welders are not a common tool to own, and most e-bike batteries are not designed to be opened, safely or otherwise.</p>\n<p>French firm Gouach, essentially a three-person company, is pitching its <a href=\"https://www.gouach.com/\">Infinite Battery</a> as the opposite of this status quo. It's a <a href=\"https://gouach.com/blogs/blogs/harsh-tests-made-on-the-infinite-battery\">durable, fireproof casing</a> into which you can place and replace 18650 batteries <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q-EEXqXcCA\">using only a screwdriver</a>.
