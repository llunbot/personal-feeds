More importantly, vaccinated people were found to be spreading the dangerous virus variant to other vaccinated people. Nationwide, the CDC estimated that there are 35,000 symptomatic breakthrough infections per week among 162 million fully vaccinated Americans.</p>\n<p>The CDC document overall highlights that delta is extremely contagious—much more so than previous versions of the virus, as well as the common cold or even the seasonal flu. Delta is more in line with the contagiousness of chickenpox, the CDC document said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1784187#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1784187&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e80da6162038d21f92c9ce6bc6df60f72890d49918e4060be363b7f0436d948e","category":"Tech"}
