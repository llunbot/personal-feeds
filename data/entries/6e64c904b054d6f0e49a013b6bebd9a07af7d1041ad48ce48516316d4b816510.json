The appeals court said the US National Labor Relations Board can enforce its order that requires Musk to delete the tweet.</p>\n<p>Musk's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/998454539941367808\">tweet</a> in May 2018 is still online and said in part, \"Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing?\" Musk issued the tweet amid a union campaign at a Tesla vehicle manufacturing plant in Fremont, California. Tesla factories are still not unionized.</p>\n<p>A federal administrative law judge <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/tesla-broke-the-law-with-anti-union-efforts-judge-rules/\">ruled</a> against Tesla and Musk in 2019, finding among other things that Musk violated labor law with the tweet. The NLRB <a href=\"https://apps.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d45833d3fce\">affirmed</a> that and most other portions of the judge's ruling in 2021. Tesla challenged in the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which sided with the NLRB in its <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca5.201092/gov.uscourts.ca5.201092.152.1.pdf\">ruling on Friday</a>:</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928673#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928673&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6e64c904b054d6f0e49a013b6bebd9a07af7d1041ad48ce48516316d4b816510","category":"Tech"}
