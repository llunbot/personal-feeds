Jackery also makes a <a href=\"https://www.jackery.com/pages/portable-power-stations\">range of larger and smaller batteries</a> to suit various needs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Explorer 500 features a pure sine wave AC outlet, a 12V/10A carport, and three 5V 2.4A USB-A ports. It can provide power to Apple products ranging from Macs to iPhones, and it can also run TVs, fans, humidifiers, projectors, and other appliances that draw under 500 watts of power.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/09/jackery2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe built-in carport and USB-A ports can be used to power car appliances like coolers, air pumps, and vacuums, along with smartphones, tablets, and other small electronic devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/jackery-explorer-500-1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nA charge can last for weeks on standby, so the Jackery Explorer 500 is ideal to have on hand for emergencies. It can run a router or a cable modem to keep you connected while working from home, or run lights and other accessories when you're camping.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/09/jackery1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nA handle at the top makes the Explorer 500 easy to carry, and a set of built-in fans keep it cool even when it's running at full power. There's an LCD screen on the front that displays the current charge level and the watts being drawn, which lets you track power usage.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/09/jackery3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can charge the Explorer 500 with a standard cable, but when paired with the SolarSaga 100W, you have off-grid power so long as you have sun. According to Jackery, the SolarSaga has high conversion efficiency up to 23 percent for powering the Explorer 500. The 9.1 pound SolarSaga folds down to be more portable, plus it has a carry handle to make it easier to transport.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/jackery-solarsaga-100w-solar-panel.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWe have a Jackery Explorer 500 Portable Battery Station and 100W SolarSaga panel to give away to one lucky <em>MacRumors</em> reader.
