But even a full about-face might not be enough to satisfy some longtime Unity developers at this point.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968985#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968985&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e9df7f9bb5051f7e17aeb4329467d7c104eabae7dad71ccc226d1ea69cea7f26","category":"Tech"}
