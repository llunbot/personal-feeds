Apple's \"dominant position in flagship smartphones\" could potentially lead to significant growth for the foldable market in 2026, ultimately leading to a record year for foldables.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYoung expects more than 30 percent growth in the foldable market in 2026, followed by continued 20 percent growth in 2027 and 2028.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere have long been rumors suggesting that Apple is developing a foldable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, and some analysts believe that Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">will finally debut a foldable iPhone</a> around September of 2026.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe first foldable ‌iPhone‌ could be between 7.9 and 8.3 inches in size, and it may have a \"clamshell\" design like Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip.
