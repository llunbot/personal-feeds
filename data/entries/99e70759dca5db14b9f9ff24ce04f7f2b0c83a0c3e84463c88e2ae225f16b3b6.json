Typically, Apple also releases a public beta (the developer one requires a developer account) for new OS updates, but it hasn't announced any specifics about that just yet.</p>\n<p>Not all the Apple Intelligence features will be part of this beta. It will include writing tools, like the ability to rewrite, proofread, or summarize text throughout the OS in first-party and most third-party apps. It will also include new Siri improvements, such as moving seamlessly between voice and typing, the ability to follow when you stumble over your words, and maintaining context from one request to the next. (It will not, however, include ChatGPT integration; Apple says that's coming later.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039736#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039736&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"99e70759dca5db14b9f9ff24ce04f7f2b0c83a0c3e84463c88e2ae225f16b3b6","category":"Tech"}
