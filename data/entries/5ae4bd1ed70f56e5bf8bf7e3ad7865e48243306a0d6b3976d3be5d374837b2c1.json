It did this both with detailed reports you could access from the local network and with a screen that glowed one of three colors: green for good, purple for problems, and red for dead. It could replace, or at least augment, typing a bunch of IP addresses into a browser and waiting for them to time out.</p>\n<p>We liked the device <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/08/a-review-of-monitor-io-a-little-gadget-that-wants-to-talk-about-your-internet/\">when we reviewed it in August 2018</a>, despite our broad understanding of it as a \"butter-passing robot,\" a device that relays information you could otherwise find out on your own. It had, beyond color-coded awareness, \"obvious technical chops and real, careful attention to detail\" in how it measured and what it could report. However, we also noted that the $100 price made sense for a small business but \"might be a bit steep\" for a household on a tight budget.</p>\n<p>Monitor-IO seems to have run out of people willing to pay for better network awareness. In <a href=\"https://www.monitor-io.com/end-of-service.html\">an \"End-of-service\" notice posted on its site</a>, the company cites \"rising costs and supply chain issues,\" among other \"numerous headwinds.\" Faced with no better option, Monitor-IO is shutting down its business and monitoring service on April 15, 2023. (Support will be offered through May 30, 2023.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930660#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930660&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5ae4bd1ed70f56e5bf8bf7e3ad7865e48243306a0d6b3976d3be5d374837b2c1","category":"Tech"}
