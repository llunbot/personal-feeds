It uses a triple-butted Ritchey Logic steel tube set and can hold a 30mm wide tire. The frameset comes with an EPD coating, keeping corrosion, dirt, and contaminants from wreaking havoc on the frame. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ritchey-Garden-City-Track-Bike-designed-by-Tom-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ritchey-Garden-City-Track-Bike-designed-by-Tom-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ritchey Garden-City Track Bike designed by Tom\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ritchey-Garden-City-Track-Bike-designed-by-Tom-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ritchey-Garden-City-Track-Bike-designed-by-Tom-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ritchey-Garden-City-Track-Bike-designed-by-Tom-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ritchey-Garden-City-Track-Bike-designed-by-Tom-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ritchey-Garden-City-Track-Bike-beautiful-bottom-bracket-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ritchey-Garden-City-Track-Bike-beautiful-bottom-bracket-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ritchey Garden-City Track Bike beautiful bottom bracket\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ritchey-Garden-City-Track-Bike-beautiful-bottom-bracket-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ritchey-Garden-City-Track-Bike-beautiful-bottom-bracket-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ritchey-Garden-City-Track-Bike-beautiful-bottom-bracket-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ritchey-Garden-City-Track-Bike-beautiful-bottom-bracket-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame is designed to fit up to a 55t chainring, so if you wanted to sprint around the local track you could.
