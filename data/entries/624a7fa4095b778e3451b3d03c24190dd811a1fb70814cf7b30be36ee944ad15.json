That means bead seating could be “turbocharged”, and you can dial in your tire pressures on the fly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Lite.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1201\" height=\"2070\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Lite.jpg\" alt=\"Muc-Off Big Bore Valves Lite\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Lite.jpg 1201w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Lite-174x300.jpg 174w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Lite-70x120.jpg 70w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Lite-768x1324.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Lite-891x1536.jpg 891w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Lite-1188x2048.jpg 1188w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Hybrid.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1201\" height=\"2089\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Hybrid.jpg\" alt=\"Muc-Off Big Bore Valves Hybrid\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Hybrid.jpg 1201w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Hybrid-172x300.jpg 172w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Hybrid-69x120.jpg 69w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Hybrid-768x1336.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Hybrid-883x1536.jpg 883w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Hybrid-1177x2048.jpg 1177w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Ludicrous.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1201\" height=\"2306\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Ludicrous.jpg\" alt=\"Muc-Off Big Bore Valves Ludicrous\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Ludicrous.jpg 1201w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Ludicrous-156x300.jpg 156w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Ludicrous-62x120.jpg 62w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Ludicrous-768x1475.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Ludicrous-800x1536.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Muc-Off-Big-Bore-Valves-Ludicrous-1067x2048.jpg 1067w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to offer the maximum airflow, the Ludricrous valves are designed around a schrader fit – both in the rim and the pump. the Hybrid is exactly as it sounds with a presta valve rim fit, and a schrader valve fit at the pump.
