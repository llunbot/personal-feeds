As a result, endangered species across the U.S. are edging closer to extinction at alarming rates—and if they disappear, critical genetic information could vanish with them.</p>\n<p>In a new initiative announced on Tuesday, the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service is working with the nonprofit <a href=\"https://reviverestore.org/projects/biobanking/\">Revive &amp; Restore</a> and other partners to create a “genetic library” of the country’s endangered species—before it’s too late.</p>\n<p>Through a process called biobanking, FWS field staff are gathering biological samples such as blood, tissues and reproductive cells from animals to be cryogenically preserved at extremely low temperatures (at least -256 degrees Fahrenheit) and stored at a USDA facility in Colorado. The samples will also be genetically sequenced and this information will be uploaded to a publicly available database called <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/\">GenBank</a>, where researchers can study them and compare their genomes to other members of their species.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973100#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973100&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Inside Climate News","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"95dddf915cb1cb9f80f922e233a5238093e995d758d4ebf55434975b533ae506","category":"Tech"}
