The investigation, which was aided by an unnamed third-party company, concluded there was no exposure of sensitive information such as Social Security numbers, financial account numbers, or payment card data.</p>\n<h2>Tight-lipped</h2>\n<p>“We detected unauthorized access to a limited amount of information in one of our non-production IT testing environments as a result of the GoAnywhere vulnerability,” Mestrovich wrote. “Importantly, based on our current investigation, being conducted with the assistance of third-party forensics experts, the unauthorized access did NOT include any data we secure on behalf of our customers via any Rubrik products.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924411#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924411&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3b3c3896608357a70b54b027ca1ee1cabeaaf33cceb1d44193f4eca995cb6981","category":"Tech"}
