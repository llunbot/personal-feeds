{"title":"Gazelle Medeo T9 City e-bike review: A steady Dutch ride in lots of sizes","link":"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/gazelle-medeo-t9-city-e-bike-review-steady-as-she-goes/","date":1747934975000,"content":"<p>I initially felt bad for the <a href=\"https://www.gazellebikes.com/en-us/ebikes/gazelle-medeo-t9-city\">Medeo T9 City</a> e-bike that Gazelle sent me for review. Not through any fault of its own but because I had just recently ridden <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/gazelle-eclipse-c380-e-bike-review-a-smart-smooth-ride-at-a-halting-price/\">Gazelle's Eclipse C380+</a>, an all-inclusive beast that retailed for roughly 2.5 times the price of the Medeo T9 City. Would the lower-priced bike, with different versions of some of the same hardware, suffer compared to its beefier brethren?</p>\n<p>Short answer: not really. The Medeo T9 City isn't trying to dominate the road; it just wants to get you where you're going. It has the same kind of automatic electric assist level shifting, just packed into a smaller handlebar display instead of a center console. It's has chain and gear cogs instead of the Eclipse's belt drive and stepless shifting, an external battery instead of an inline, and a 250-watt Bosch Active Line motor instead of a 350-watt Performance Line Speed.</p>\n<p>I think the Medeo T9 City likely makes for a good first or second e-bike, or perhaps a nice upgrade if you're prioritizing comfort and transport. Given its hill-smoothing motor, wide range of sizes, stable ride feel, and the backing of known bike brands, you could do much worse than a Gazelle with a Bosch motor.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/gazelle-medeo-t9-city-e-bike-review-steady-as-she-goes/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/gazelle-medeo-t9-city-e-bike-review-steady-as-she-goes/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7fc007f4945d13f6710a3aa3f5196e7e246836870307b16728633c6dc32e3df0","category":"Tech"}
