Aapparently, those who have been using the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/350094/macos-monterey-developer-beta-public-beta-install-access-utility-macs.html\">Monterey beta</a> have let Apple know its not a welcome change. It looks like Apple has taken the criticism to heart, because in the latest Monterey beta, Safari’s UI is a lot more like the one we’re all familiar with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big change has to do with the URL/search box. Apple had made it so that the box was dedicated to a single tab. When you clicked on a tab, it became the active page, and the tab itself would show the URL box.

This new option is enabled by default, and you can switch between it and the single-row design via <em>View</em> &gt; <em>Show Separate Tab Bar</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macos-monterey-safari-15-show-tab-bar.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /><figcaption><p>Safari in macOS Monterey will have the option to show the Tab Bar as a seaprate component of the UI.</p></figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This new Tab Bar option is currently only implemented in the version of Safari 15 that is included with the Monterey beta 3.
