For wheels, DT built up two of their flagship carbon wheelsets with silver spokes and polished silver hubs – the ultralight &amp; aerodynamic ARC1100 38mm aero road wheels and the bombproof &amp; fast-engaging EXC1200 enduro wheels. And for a hubset alone, they picked their latest 90 POE fast-engaging 240 DEG hubs with classic high flanges so you can build up your own 4° engagement MTB wheels…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DT Swiss’ 30th Anniversary in the cycling industry</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/DT-Swiss-Biel-Switzerland-factory-tour_spokerimwheel-production_19_spoke-production.gif\"><img width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/DT-Swiss-Biel-Switzerland-factory-tour_spokerimwheel-production_19_spoke-production.gif\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>DT wireworks (that’s what the D&amp;T stand for in their native German &amp; French – <em>Drahtwerke/Tréfileries</em>, respectively) have been manufacturing Swiss wire since the 1600s, originally for fencing. But they turned that wire into bicycle spokes in their modern form, starting 30 years ago now in 1994.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/DT-Swiss-Biel-Switzerland-factory-tour_spokerimwheel-production_20_spoke-production-screw.gif\"><img width=\"500\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/DT-Swiss-Biel-Switzerland-factory-tour_spokerimwheel-production_20_spoke-production-screw.gif\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We actually toured their Biel/Bienne HQ and spoke, rim &amp; wheel factory in Switzerland <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/factory-tour-dt-swiss-shows-us-make-rims-spokes-premium-wheelsets/\" target=\"_blank\">back in 2017</a> to see how our wheels get made. And that’s still how they do it, although they have since added a couple new high-tech cold-forged spoke types like the latest fluted <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/dt-swiss-revolite-mountain-bike-spokes/\" target=\"_blank\">RevoLite</a> since then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, back to the 30th-anniversary kit…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Limited edition 30th Anniversary DT Swiss hubs &amp; wheels</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-Honors-30-Years-with-Retro-Limited-Edition-Modern-Wheels-and-Hubs_old-school-90s-Hugi-hub.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-Honors-30-Years-with-Retro-Limited-Edition-Modern-Wheels-and-Hubs_old-school-90s-Hugi-hub.jpg\" alt=\"Limited edition 30th Anniversary DT Swiss hubs &amp; wheels, old school 1990s DT Hugi MTB hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-Honors-30-Years-with-Retro-Limited-Edition-Modern-Wheels-and-Hubs_old-school-90s-Hugi-hub.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-Honors-30-Years-with-Retro-Limited-Edition-Modern-Wheels-and-Hubs_old-school-90s-Hugi-hub-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-Honors-30-Years-with-Retro-Limited-Edition-Modern-Wheels-and-Hubs_old-school-90s-Hugi-hub-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-Honors-30-Years-with-Retro-Limited-Edition-Modern-Wheels-and-Hubs_old-school-90s-Hugi-hub-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-Honors-30-Years-with-Retro-Limited-Edition-Modern-Wheels-and-Hubs_old-school-90s-Hugi-hub-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-Honors-30-Years-with-Retro-Limited-Edition-Modern-Wheels-and-Hubs_old-school-90s-Hugi-hub-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-Honors-30-Years-with-Retro-Limited-Edition-Modern-Wheels-and-Hubs_old-school-90s-Hugi-hub-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(All photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason we are writing (and you are reading) is shiny silver hubs, shiny silver spokes, and retro red DT logos. There’s too many all-black bike and components these days, and so DT is bringing back some flash.

Their big update is essentially 3x the engagement of a standard DT hub, or almost 2x the max possible engagement from any previous DT hub, but while retaining the same proven Ratchet mechanism and unrivaled freehub durability. The 240 DEG hub features a pair of oversized 90T ratchet rings delivering quick 4° engagement, perfect for the most technical mountain biking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These shiny polished silver hubs with retro DT logos sell for $230 / 170€ front and $500 / 377€ rear. They are available now in limited numbers through DT distributors for Shimano MicroSpline or SRAM XD in 6-bolt with Boost MTB spacing only, drilled for 32 J-bend spokes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DT EXC 1200 Classic DEG 3 Dec</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-30th-anniversary-EXC-1200-Classic-DEG-3-Dec-carbon-enduro-mountain-bike-wheels_rim-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-30th-anniversary-EXC-1200-Classic-DEG-3-Dec-carbon-enduro-mountain-bike-wheels_rim-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Limited edition 30th Anniversary DT Swiss hubs &amp; wheels, EXC1200 3 Dec enduro MTB wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-30th-anniversary-EXC-1200-Classic-DEG-3-Dec-carbon-enduro-mountain-bike-wheels_rim-detail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-30th-anniversary-EXC-1200-Classic-DEG-3-Dec-carbon-enduro-mountain-bike-wheels_rim-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-30th-anniversary-EXC-1200-Classic-DEG-3-Dec-carbon-enduro-mountain-bike-wheels_rim-detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-30th-anniversary-EXC-1200-Classic-DEG-3-Dec-carbon-enduro-mountain-bike-wheels_rim-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-30th-anniversary-EXC-1200-Classic-DEG-3-Dec-carbon-enduro-mountain-bike-wheels_rim-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-30th-anniversary-EXC-1200-Classic-DEG-3-Dec-carbon-enduro-mountain-bike-wheels_rim-detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-30th-anniversary-EXC-1200-Classic-DEG-3-Dec-carbon-enduro-mountain-bike-wheels_rim-detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the complete mountain bike wheels side, you can get a limited edition EXC 1200 Classic DEG 3 Dec wheelset. This $3000 / 2500€  carbon enduro wheel features DT Swiss’ revamped carbon molding tech and internal protection layers that promised to build much tougher lightweight carbon mountain bike wheels – <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/dt-swiss-1200-series-revamped-carbon-mountain-bike-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">debuted just over a month ago</a>. I’ve been riding the lighter all-mountain set since the start of summer trouble-free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1756g EXC enduro MTB wheels feature a 30mm internal and are built on those 90POE fast-engaging 240 DEG hubs. You can pick full 29er or mullet setups, and they come with both MicroSpline &amp; XD freehub bodies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>ARC 1100 Dicut DB 38 3 Dec</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-DT-Swiss-ARC-1100-Dicut-DB-38-3-Dec-limited-edition-lightweight-aero-road-wheelset.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-DT-Swiss-ARC-1100-Dicut-DB-38-3-Dec-limited-edition-lightweight-aero-road-wheelset.jpg\" alt=\"Limited edition 30th Anniversary DT Swiss hubs &amp; wheels, ARC1100 3 Dec road wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-DT-Swiss-ARC-1100-Dicut-DB-38-3-Dec-limited-edition-lightweight-aero-road-wheelset.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-DT-Swiss-ARC-1100-Dicut-DB-38-3-Dec-limited-edition-lightweight-aero-road-wheelset-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-DT-Swiss-ARC-1100-Dicut-DB-38-3-Dec-limited-edition-lightweight-aero-road-wheelset-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-DT-Swiss-ARC-1100-Dicut-DB-38-3-Dec-limited-edition-lightweight-aero-road-wheelset-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-DT-Swiss-ARC-1100-Dicut-DB-38-3-Dec-limited-edition-lightweight-aero-road-wheelset-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-DT-Swiss-ARC-1100-Dicut-DB-38-3-Dec-limited-edition-lightweight-aero-road-wheelset-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-DT-Swiss-ARC-1100-Dicut-DB-38-3-Dec-limited-edition-lightweight-aero-road-wheelset-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And lastly, roadies get a lightweight aero wheelset, too. The latest Aerodynamic Race Carbon road wheel series added this 38mm deep x 22mm internal hooked tubeless wheel to the line-up this year at a weight of just 1292g.
