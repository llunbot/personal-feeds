Brimming with new smart technology, these comfort commuters and all-terrain eBikes are able to improve as they age, thanks to their new ability to receive over-the-air updates via an App on the owner’s smart phone. The top-end 5.0 models of each bike pair a 710Wh battery with the newly refined Specialized Full Power 2.2 Motor to deliver a range of up to 90 miles of smooth and silent power-assisted pedaling. Here’s everything you need to know.</p><h2>2022 Specialized Turbo Como, Vado &amp; Tero eBikes</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075645/2022-specialized-turbo-vado-ebike-commuter.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075645/2022-specialized-turbo-vado-ebike-commuter.jpg\" alt=\"2022 specialized turbo vado\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075645/2022-specialized-turbo-vado-ebike-commuter.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075645/2022-specialized-turbo-vado-ebike-commuter-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075645/2022-specialized-turbo-vado-ebike-commuter-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075645/2022-specialized-turbo-vado-ebike-commuter-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075645/2022-specialized-turbo-vado-ebike-commuter-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075645/2022-specialized-turbo-vado-ebike-commuter-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>For 2022, Specialized bring three new Turbo eBikes to market. The Turbo Vado is what Specialized describe as their “vehicle for life”. This one is something of a comfort commuter, designed to get the rider from A to B as swiftly, safely and smoothly as possible.</p><p>To measure that “smoothness”, Specialized actually used a custom test mechanism previously used on their XC race bikes. The data pushed them to spec larger volume tires, an updated suspension fork and a suspended seat post, all of which work together to isolate road vibrations from the rider, giving them the most comfortable journey possible. Why go to all that trouble? Because less vibration equals reduced rider fatigue, and more comfort, obviously.

This one gets more upright seated position, giving the rider a “heads-up” riding position, taking pressure off the hands. The step-thru frame is said to be more manageable for riders who want to load the bike up, whether that’s with groceries or a child. This one also gets a “walk mode”, technology carried over from the line of Specialized eMTBs.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"attachment_272252\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21083439/specialized-full-power-ebike-motor.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-272252\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21083439/specialized-full-power-ebike-motor.jpg\" alt=\"specialized full power 2.2 ebike motor\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21083439/specialized-full-power-ebike-motor.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21083439/specialized-full-power-ebike-motor-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21083439/specialized-full-power-ebike-motor-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21083439/specialized-full-power-ebike-motor-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21083439/specialized-full-power-ebike-motor-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21083439/specialized-full-power-ebike-motor-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-272252\">The refined Specialized Full Power 2.2 eBike motor has a maximum torque of 90Nm and maximum power output of 560 Watts</p></div><p>Finally, the Turbo Tero is Specialized hardtail eMTB.

There are many practical considerations to be made if you’re seriously considering swapping your car for an eBike to do your daily journeys like commuting to work, grocery shopping, dropping the kids at nursery… the list goes on.&nbsp;For the new Turbo Como, Turbo Vado and Turbo Tero, Specialized have considered them all.&nbsp;</p><p>Safety, bike security, and carrying stuff are some of the top priorities.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"attachment_272248\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21080253/garmin-radar-specialized-turbo-como.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-272248\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21080253/garmin-radar-specialized-turbo-como.jpg\" alt=\"garmin radar specialized ebike commuter\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21080253/garmin-radar-specialized-turbo-como.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21080253/garmin-radar-specialized-turbo-como-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21080253/garmin-radar-specialized-turbo-como-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21080253/garmin-radar-specialized-turbo-como-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21080253/garmin-radar-specialized-turbo-como-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21080253/garmin-radar-specialized-turbo-como-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-272248\">A <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020/05/13/garmin-varia-rearview-radar-new-app-add-affordable-road-safety-options-with-or-without-a-garmin-gps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Garmin Radar</a> is affixed to the rear of the 27kg capacity rack on the ultra-low step-thru Specialized Turbo Como</p></div><p>The top-end 5.0 models of the new Specialized Turbo eBikes get a Garmin Radar. This device sits on the back of the bike, rearward facing, and alerts the rider to vehicles approaching from behind. These can be retrofitted to any bike, of course, but Specialized have gone the extra mile, integrating the Garmin Radar into the bikes’ Mastermind control and display unit. The display will actually show the rider how many cars are approaching from behind, as well as the relative distances between them in real-time. You can even set up haptic feedback for this; the handlebar grips will vibrate when a car approaches from behind, so you don’t ever have to divert your eyes away from the road.</p><div id=\"attachment_272246\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075652/specialized-mastermind-display-unit-turbo-ebikes.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-272246\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075652/specialized-mastermind-display-unit-turbo-ebikes.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized mastermind control unit display\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075652/specialized-mastermind-display-unit-turbo-ebikes.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075652/specialized-mastermind-display-unit-turbo-ebikes-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075652/specialized-mastermind-display-unit-turbo-ebikes-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075652/specialized-mastermind-display-unit-turbo-ebikes-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075652/specialized-mastermind-display-unit-turbo-ebikes-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075652/specialized-mastermind-display-unit-turbo-ebikes-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-272246\">The Specialized Mastermind Control Unit can display your regular ride stats such as speed, distance, battery use, etc., but is also home to on-ride diagnostics and pedal pace coaching functions. Specialized tell us that 70-80 rpm is the most efficient cadence for their motor and battery pairing – the Mastermind display unit will give the rider a green light when they are pedaling within this cadence range to let them know how efficiently they are pedaling.</p></div><p>Theft is another major consideration. These eBikes aren’t cheap, with pricing starting at $3,250 USD for the lowest spec 3.0 models. The Specialized Mastermind Control unit can lock the bike’s motor, unlockable via the Mission Control App on the rider’s smart phone. This doesn’t render the bike immovable (it doesn’t lock the drivetrain) but it does prevent the motor being used. The technology isn’t designed to replace an actual physical lock, but it is a theft deterrent nevertheless, especially if you set up the motion sensor alarm which will wail loudly as the thief makes their escape.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"attachment_272241\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075635/2022-specialized-tubo-como-child-seat-trailer-compatible.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-272241\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075635/2022-specialized-tubo-como-child-seat-trailer-compatible.jpg\" alt=\"2022 specialized turbo como ebike trailer child seat compatible\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075635/2022-specialized-tubo-como-child-seat-trailer-compatible.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075635/2022-specialized-tubo-como-child-seat-trailer-compatible-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075635/2022-specialized-tubo-como-child-seat-trailer-compatible-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075635/2022-specialized-tubo-como-child-seat-trailer-compatible-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075635/2022-specialized-tubo-como-child-seat-trailer-compatible-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21075635/2022-specialized-tubo-como-child-seat-trailer-compatible-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-272241\">The 2022 Specialized Turbo eBikes are child seat and trailer compatible</p></div><p>How about carrying stuff?

That said, they do tend to have a smaller gear range than traditional derailleur group sets, so if your journeys have a wide variety of gradients, including some very steep hills, you might want to opt for the cheaper drivetrain option.</p><h3>Specialized Mode Helmet</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21082745/specialized-mode-commuter-helmet-mips.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21082745/specialized-mode-commuter-helmet-mips.jpg\" alt=\"specialized mode helemt urban commuter\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21082745/specialized-mode-commuter-helmet-mips.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21082745/specialized-mode-commuter-helmet-mips-297x247.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21082745/specialized-mode-commuter-helmet-mips-800x667.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21082745/specialized-mode-commuter-helmet-mips-120x100.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21082745/specialized-mode-commuter-helmet-mips-768x640.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21082745/specialized-mode-commuter-helmet-mips-1536x1280.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>In conjunction with the launch of the 2022 Specialized Turbo eBikes, the brand are releasing the new Mode Helmet, designed with an urban appropriate aesthetic. At first glance, it looks as though it lacks any sort of ventilation but if you look more closely, you’ll see a ridge right the way around the helmet, under which there’s a heap of internal venting to keep the rider’s head cool.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21082955/specialized-turbo-ebike-launch-mode-helemt.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21082955/specialized-turbo-ebike-launch-mode-helemt.jpg\" alt=\"specialized turbo ebike launch\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21082955/specialized-turbo-ebike-launch-mode-helemt.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21082955/specialized-turbo-ebike-launch-mode-helemt-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21082955/specialized-turbo-ebike-launch-mode-helemt-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21082955/specialized-turbo-ebike-launch-mode-helemt-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21082955/specialized-turbo-ebike-launch-mode-helemt-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21082955/specialized-turbo-ebike-launch-mode-helemt-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The design isn’t all about urban aesthetics. The Specialized Mode helmet also gets MIPS rotational impact protection technology, designed to prevent concussion injuries arising from rotational impact. It generally makes helmets around 10% safer than those without MIPS.</p><h3>Pricing &amp; Availability</h3><p>The starting price for the 2022 Specialized Turbo Como, Tero and Vado eBikes is $3,250 USD (for the 3.0 model with a traditional drivetrain). An extra $500 USD gets you the low maintenance option with an Internal Gear Hub from Enviolo. Pricing tops out at $5,500 USD for the all-singing all-dancing 5.0 models with the IGH.</p><p>The Turbo Vado and Turbo Tero eBikes launch today with stock available globally. The Turbo Como won’t be available until Fall, but you should be able to to pre-order one from today.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en?gaRegionChange=US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>SpecializedBikes.com</em></a></p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Jessie-May Morgan","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"dca6d646706b766677d04e67751b9303a454ffc6aaaf968bde1782d01678d3c0","category":"Cycling"}
