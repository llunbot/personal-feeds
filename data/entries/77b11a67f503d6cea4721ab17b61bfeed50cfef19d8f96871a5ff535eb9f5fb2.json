Florida is the first state to win such an authorization, and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/2024/01/05/florida-becomes-first-in-the-nation-to-have-canadian-drug-importation-program-approved-by-fda/\">celebrated it</a>, claiming the drug imports will save the state \"up to $180 million in the first year alone.\" There are caveats, though. Before Florida can import any drugs, it must complete several obligations, including submitting to the FDA additional drug-specific information, testing the drugs for authenticity and FDA compliance, and relabeling them in accordance with FDA labeling.</p>\n<p>The FDA authorized the importation program in accordance with section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act). The move stems from President Biden’s \"Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy,\" which directed the FDA to help develop such programs.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994816#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994816&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"77b11a67f503d6cea4721ab17b61bfeed50cfef19d8f96871a5ff535eb9f5fb2","category":"Tech"}
