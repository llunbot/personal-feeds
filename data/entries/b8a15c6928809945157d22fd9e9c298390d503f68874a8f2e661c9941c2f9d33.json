And what are some of the <strong>critical conversations</strong> we need to have early to avoid problems down the line?</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are a few <strong>useful little helpers</strong> to get started ‚Äî and they are the ones I tend to rely on quite a bit when initiating any design system projects.</p>\nDesign System In 90 Days Canvas\n<p><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1275210165201477676\"><strong>Design System in 90 Days Canvas (FigJam template)</strong></a> is a handy set of <strong>useful questions</strong> to start a design system effort.
