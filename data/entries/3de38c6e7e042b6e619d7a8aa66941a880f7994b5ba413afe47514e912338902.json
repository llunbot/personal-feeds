Nestled between France and Spain right in the thick of the Pyrenees, the principality is just 468km² but it has 21 marked mountain passes, which have played host to Tour de France and Vuelta a España stages for over 50 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, there’s an ever-expanding network of mountain bike routes; it hosts UCI MTB World Cups every year and will welcome the World Championships in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"727\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Cami-panoramica-970x727.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Cami-panoramica-970x727.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Cami-panoramica-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Cami-panoramica-768x575.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Cami-panoramica-1536x1150.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Cami-panoramica-2048x1534.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Cami-panoramica-750x562.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Cami-panoramica-1140x854.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also the perfect destination for altitude training, with the country’s lowest point sitting at 840m above sea level and its highest almost 3,000m. There’s little wonder why its tiny population includes a large number of pro cyclists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to cycling’s popularity in Andorra, it’s set up perfectly for cyclotourists, with signposted routes, bike-friendly hotels, restaurants and cafés and even a museum and cycling centre in Bici Lab Andorra Museum, which features exhibits of cycling’s past, present and future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>On the road</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"727\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Carretera-970x727.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Carretera-970x727.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Carretera-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Carretera-768x575.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Carretera-1536x1150.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Carretera-2048x1534.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Carretera-750x562.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Carretera-1140x854.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Any fans of pro cycling will be familiar with some of Andorra’s legendary road climbs, which have featured countless times in both the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España. There are a total of 21 mountain passes – and yes that <em>is </em>a challenge – that take in stunning switchbacks and sensational scenery, it’s really a playground for <a href=\"https://visitandorra.com/en/cycling-in-andorra/?atm_campaign=2cab07f5-5ad7-4c4b-8534-b8fa251d9a34&amp;utm_campaign=en-gb_campanya_estiu_24&amp;utm_source=cyclist&amp;utm_medium=cpm&amp;utm_term=link2&amp;utm_content=contingut\" target=\"_blank\">road cycling</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To name just a few to tick off your next trip: Sant Juliá de Lòria has three classics in La Rabassa, the Coll de la Gallina and La Peguera; Andorra resident Sepp Kuss conquered the hairpin bends on the Port d’Envalira and the Col de Beixalis on his way to a famous win at the 2021 Tour; and you can’t forget the legendary pass of the Coll d’Ordino and the sculpture-topped Port del Cabús.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can spend weeks riding in Andorra and ride a new climb every day. Just make sure to look up because the scenery is definitely worth the struggle of the ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there’s more to Andorra than tarmac.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Off piste</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Paisatge-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Paisatge-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Paisatge-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Paisatge-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Paisatge-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Paisatge-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Paisatge-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Paisatge-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Paisatge-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Paisatge-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Paisatge-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Andorra is a regular on the pro mountain bike circuit – the UCI World Cup takes over at the end of August – and the Pal Arinsal resort will host the UCI MTB World Championships in 2024. Pal Arinsal is one of three dedicated parks for mountain bikers to discover, with endless trails for all kinds of riding and all levels of ability, the others being Naturland Bike Center and Grandvalira.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because Andorra is a popular winter sports destination, the ski runs become unmissable off-road descents when the snow melts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the extent of both the road and off-road routes, Andorra is an ideal place for cycle touring – it even has a signposted e-bike trail that takes riders around 94km of Grandvalira, and of course a motor is a blessing when you have to head back up into the mountains.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>For all the family</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Llac-cicloturisme-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Llac-cicloturisme-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Llac-cicloturisme-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Llac-cicloturisme-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Llac-cicloturisme-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Llac-cicloturisme-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Llac-cicloturisme-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Llac-cicloturisme-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Llac-cicloturisme-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Llac-cicloturisme-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Llac-cicloturisme-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While Andorra’s infrastructure means it’s possible to have a bike-centred holiday for all the <a href=\"https://visitandorra.com/en/with-family/?atm_campaign=2cab07f5-5ad7-4c4b-8534-b8fa251d9a34&amp;utm_campaign=en-gb_campanya_estiu_24&amp;utm_source=cyclist&amp;utm_medium=cpm&amp;utm_term=link3&amp;utm_content=contingut\" target=\"_blank\">family</a>, there is of course plenty more to do. It’s unsurprisingly a great place to hike, and in winter it’s a haven for winter sports-lovers. For even more adrenaline there are endless signposted and equipped climbing routes, plus five canyons to try your hand at canyoneering. For a calmer day out, Andorra is also home to Europe’s highest golf course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are 21 passes in Andorra, there are around 80 mountains to explore in total, with more than 100 signposted trails to hike that cross the whole of Andorra, including one that loops 120km around the country in seven parts. There are also loads of trail running routes if cycling isn’t tough enough for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The forests are also humming with activity, including zip-lining, tobogganing, archery, and horse and pony riding. There are loads of incredible panoramic viewpoints, and cable cars to help you reach the top (perfect for a rest day). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are trails just for kids, too. The Macarulla are easy loops packed with activities, hidden treasures and magic. They blend fun with education about the nature and and culture of the local area – including its association with myths, legends and magical characters. There’s also magic in the <em>tamarros</em>, which are legendary creatures in Andorran folklore that protect the countryside; there are at least seven of them around Andorra and your children will be rewarded for helping to find their magic portals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside that there are plenty of hiking routes that are child-friendly, including around the many beautiful lakes around the country such as Estanys de Tristaina in Ordino and Llac d’Engolasters near Andorra La Vella.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"727\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Pont-tibeta-970x727.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Pont-tibeta-970x727.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Pont-tibeta-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Pont-tibeta-768x575.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Pont-tibeta-1536x1150.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Pont-tibeta-2048x1534.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Pont-tibeta-750x562.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Pont-tibeta-1140x854.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a wealth of nature to see – the Madriu-Perafita-Claror Valley is a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its natural beauty, while Ordino is recognised as a UNESCO biosphere reserve <em>and </em>has been named ‘best tourist village’ by the World Tourism Organisation for its commitment to nature and the environment. Ordino is also home to the Sorteny Nature Park, which has an incredible selection of flora and fauna that you can see on guided tourist routes that focus on birds, butterflies, wetlands, glacial circus countryside and ancient forests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other must-see park is the Comapedrosa Nature Park in la Massana, which includes Andorra’s highest peak, the Pic del Comapedrosa, and is a Starlight Destination and Reserve, meaning its view of the night sky is protected. Being so high up the scenery includes forests, lakes and even waterfalls, which you can see via hikes, bikes and horseback, it also has plenty of family-friendly activities and mountain huts that have eating options and places to stay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For cyclists – in fact, for anyone that loves being outdoors – you’d be hard pressed to find a better place for a summer getaway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information visit <a href=\"https://visitandorra.com/en/?atm_campaign=2cab07f5-5ad7-4c4b-8534-b8fa251d9a34&amp;utm_campaign=en-gb_campanya_estiu_24&amp;utm_source=cyclist&amp;utm_medium=cpm&amp;utm_term=link4&amp;utm_content=contingut\" target=\"_blank\">www.visitandorra.com</a> and @andorraworld</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/andorra-cycling\">Andorra is cycling at its peak</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"3de38c6e7e042b6e619d7a8aa66941a880f7994b5ba413afe47514e912338902","category":"Cycling"}
