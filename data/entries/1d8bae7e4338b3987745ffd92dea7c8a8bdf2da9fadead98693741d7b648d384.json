By comparison, all four iPhone 16 models are equipped with a 12-megapixel front camera.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnother analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, also claimed that at least one iPhone 17 model <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/\">would be equipped with a 24-megapixel front camera</a>, so this upgrade has been rumored by multiple sources. Kuo said it will \"significantly improve the image quality.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith a higher 24-megapixel resolution, photos can maintain their quality even when cropped to a greater degree, providing more flexibility in post-processing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPu reiterated other iPhone 17 rumors, including an increased 12GB of RAM and a 48-megapixel Telephoto camera for the Pro and Pro Max models. He also expects the A19 and A19 Pro chips to use TSMC's newer third-generation 3nm process, known as N3P.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll four iPhone 17 models are expected to launch in September.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/\">iPhone 17 Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/iphone-17-24mp-front-camera-more/\">All Four iPhone 17 Models Rumored to Feature Upgraded 24-Megapixel Front Camera and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-four-iphone-17-models-rumored-to-feature-upgraded-24-megapixel-front-camera-and-more.2453370/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1d8bae7e4338b3987745ffd92dea7c8a8bdf2da9fadead98693741d7b648d384","category":"Apple"}
