Apple did not include a gold option in the iPhone 15 lineup, so a similar variant could see heightened demand.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOne <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/29/iphone-16-pro-new-polished-titanium-finish/\">rumor</a> suggests that Apple is using an improved process for finishing and coloring titanium, which will result in a glossier look than the brushed aluminum finish of the iPhone 15 Pro models. The glossy finish could look much more like the stainless steel that Apple used in prior years, but it will be more resistant to scratches.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe don't actually know the official color names yet, but Apple may choose to stick with the Titanium colorway branding it used for the iPhone 15 Pro models. The next-generation iPhone 16 lineup is due to arrive around mid-September, so we will know for sure soon.
