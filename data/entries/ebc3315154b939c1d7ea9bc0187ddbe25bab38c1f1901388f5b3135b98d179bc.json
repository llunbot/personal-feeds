As you can see from some of the new trade-in values below, the adjustments are slight, but the promotion still means more credit toward an upgrade than customers would have gotten yesterday:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 14 Pro Max: Up to $650 (vs. $630)</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 14 Pro: Up to $530 (vs. $520)</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 14 Plus: Up to $430 (vs. $420)</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 14: Up to $380 (vs. $370)</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 13 Pro Max: Up to $460 (vs. $450)</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 13 Pro: Up to $380 (vs. $370)</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 13: Up to $320 (vs. $300)</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 13 mini: Up to $300 (vs. $270)</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone SE (3rd generation): Up to $170 (vs. $160)</li>\r<br />\n</ul>Over the weekend, <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/18/apple-increase-trade-in-value-iphone-15-customers/\">shared news</a> of the promotion ahead of time. However, Gurman said the better trade-in values would only apply to customers purchasing one of Apple's latest iPhone 15 models, and that's not the case. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn the contrary, the boosted values listed above apply to any series model in Apple's current smartphone lineup, including the iPhone 14, iPhone 13, and iPhone SE.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTrade-ins can be completed on Apple's website or at an Apple Store, and the credit can be applied towards the purchase of a new Apple product, or placed on an Apple gift card for later use.
