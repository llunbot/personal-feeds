If an exoplanet is too far away for even the most powerful telescopes to search directly for water or certain biosignatures, is there something else that may tell us about the possibility of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/10/what-would-signal-life-on-another-planet/\">habitability</a>? The answer could be carbon dioxide.</p>\n<p>Led by Amaury Triaud and Julien de Wit, an international team of researchers is now proposing that the absence of CO<sub>2</sub> in a planet’s atmosphere potentially increases the chances of liquid water on its surface. Earth’s own atmosphere <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/OceanCarbon#:~:text=The%20ocean%20takes%20up%20carbon%20dioxide%20through%20photosynthesis%20by%20plant,with%20seawater%2C%20creating%20carbonic%20acid\">is depleted of CO<sub>2</sub></a>. Unlike dry Mars and Venus, which have high concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> in their atmospheres, oceans on our planet have taken immense amounts of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere because the gas dissolves in water. CO<sub>2</sub> deficits in exoplanet atmospheres might mean the same.</p>\n<p>Another molecule could be a sign of a habitable planet: ozone. Many organisms on Earth (especially plants) breathe carbon dioxide and release oxygen. This oxygen reacts with sunlight and becomes O<sub>3</sub>, or ozone, which is easier to detect than atmospheric oxygen. The presence of ozone and absence of carbon dioxide could mean a habitable, and even inhabited, planet.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994585#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994585&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ab70fc5f518b1ee626f0701599a548a0fccfd64d1ce45f93f1495edc2d9b83f5","category":"Tech"}
