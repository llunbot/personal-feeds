Kennedy Jr., who experts say are partially responsible\nfor helping seed the skepticism that’s contributed to slowing\nvaccination rates across the country.</p>\n\n<p>As part of a new set of policies aimed at cutting down on\nanti-vaccine content on the Google-owned site, YouTube will ban\nany videos that claim that commonly used vaccines approved by\nhealth authorities are ineffective or dangerous. The company\npreviously blocked videos that made those claims about coronavirus\nvaccines, but not ones for other vaccines like those for measles\nor chickenpox.</p>\n\n<p>Misinformation researchers have for years said the popularity of\nanti-vaccine content on YouTube was contributing to growing\nskepticism of lifesaving vaccines in the United States and around\nthe world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>More like this, please.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/29/youtube-anti-vax-ban\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7dfa27fdca3825ffc1f8bbb4682afee4d0a0469f8073db98048e8844229ccedc","category":"Tech"}
