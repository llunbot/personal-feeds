The Privateers in size 45 without the cleat installed came in at 332g. The Distanza weighed in at 341g in a size 46, with the SPD cleat <em>installed</em>. A Shimano SPD cleat and bolts weighs 23g, so the Distanza is 318g in comparison.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How’d they Fit</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UDOG-Distanza-Gravel-Shoe-standing-in-the-dirt.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UDOG-Distanza-Gravel-Shoe-standing-in-the-dirt-800x533.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UDOG-Distanza-Gravel-Shoe-standing-in-the-dirt-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UDOG-Distanza-Gravel-Shoe-standing-in-the-dirt-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UDOG-Distanza-Gravel-Shoe-standing-in-the-dirt-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UDOG-Distanza-Gravel-Shoe-standing-in-the-dirt-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UDOG-Distanza-Gravel-Shoe-standing-in-the-dirt-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UDOG-Distanza-Gravel-Shoe-standing-in-the-dirt.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When I first slipped them on and laced them up, the Distanza felt big.

The TWS is supposedly part of the 16 points of contact that Udog created between the shoe’s upper and your feet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, the actual TWS are the straps that hug the metatarsal area of your foot when tightening your laces “from the instep to the bridge”. When trying to get it to tighten to see how it feels, I found it hard to get it to move by just tugging at the laces when tying my shoes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got it tight by pulling on the laces right after the strap, and I’ll tell you I didn’t like the way it feels and was not convinced of its claimed benefit. It honestly felt like it was going to create a hot spot before I even got on the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t know about you guys, but that area of my foot is where I get my hot spots and I keep it loose on my Privateers for that reason, it’s the last place I want to cinch down on my foot. More on this in the review. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UDOG-Distanza-Gravel-Shoe-difining-outsole.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UDOG-Distanza-Gravel-Shoe-difining-outsole-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"UDOG Distanza Gravel Shoe difining outsole\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UDOG-Distanza-Gravel-Shoe-difining-outsole-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UDOG-Distanza-Gravel-Shoe-difining-outsole-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UDOG-Distanza-Gravel-Shoe-difining-outsole-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UDOG-Distanza-Gravel-Shoe-difining-outsole-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UDOG-Distanza-Gravel-Shoe-difining-outsole-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UDOG-Distanza-Gravel-Shoe-difining-outsole.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Distanzas Nylon Carbon sole isn’t overly stiff, although when wearing it to walk around, and riding a little with them, so far it feels plenty stiff. Obviously, as I get out there more with them and get some climbing and harder efforts, I will have more info for you in the full review.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sizing and Retail</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Udog says that their shoes fit true to size and that they use standard cycling sizes. “If you wear brands such as Specialized, fi’zi:k, or Giro all you have to do is choose the number you usually use. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sizes range from 38 to 48. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Distanza Ash Grey: $200</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Distanza Carbon Cinder Black: $275</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m really looking forward to riding the crap outta these shoes. As of now, they look and feel like they can take it… we’ll see. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned! </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://udog.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">Udog.cc</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-look-udog-distanza-gravel-shoes/\">First Look: UDOG Distanza, a Gravel Shoe That Looks Like a Climbing Shoe?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"3e96b3f42be5739b7668f456fcaecfaa70356a6e20ac1bcd4cb174ce90130d2c","category":"Cycling"}
