I don’t know. Probably not. But two weeks after Vision Pro went on sale there was a bizarre rash of stories suggesting they were being returned in droves, probably driven by this Victoria Song piece for the Verge, with the — I must say — mildly jacktastic headline “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24072792/apple-vision-pro-early-adopters-returns\">Apple Fans Are Starting to Return Their Vision Pros</a>”.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I can tell there’s no public evidence that Vision Pros are being returned in higher-than-typical numbers, just click-bait social media posts making a show of it. And anecdotally, everything I’ve seen or been told is that returns are neither higher nor lower than typical.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/28/vision-pro-returns\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1e7ecccf3431d9735074366d680611eb0e9db46fb291be1619d287a9c4cfbeee","category":"Tech"}
