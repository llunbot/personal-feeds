Alternatively, you could choose to mix and match droplets to create your own flavor profile. That's the long-term goal of the so-called \"<a href=\"https://exertiongameslab.org/dancing-delicacies-interactive-food\">Dancing Delicacies</a>\" computational food project, which brings together scientists from Monash University’s Exertion Games Lab, Carnegie Mellon University’s <a href=\"https://www.morphingmatter.cs.cmu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Morphing Matter Lab</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.gaudi.ch/GaudiLabs/?page_id=2\" target=\"_blank\">Gaudi Labs</a> in Switzerland to explore innovative new ways to turn meals into interactive performance art. Their latest invention is a 3D-printed plate that uses electrical voltage to manipulate liquid droplets, according to a <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3563657.3596021\">paper published</a> as part of the 2023 Designing Interactive Systems Conference.</p>\n<p>“Cooking and eating is more than simply producing a dish and then facilitating energy intake,” co-author Floyd Mueller of Monash <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/lesliekatz/2023/10/16/whoa-food-just-danced-around-a-plate-all-by-itself/\">told Forbes</a>. “It is about sharing, caring, crafting, slowing down and self-expression, and Dancing Delicacies aims to highlight these virtues at a time when they are often forgotten. The integration of food and computing will transform how we understand both computing and food as not two very different things, but a new frontier that combines the best of both.”</p>\n<p>Chefs have been working with this kind of innovation for years via the molecular gastronomy and molecular mixology movements, creating a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpjouddaGuY\">\"Flor de Caco\" dessert</a> in which a cocoa bean expands like a flower when exposed to hot chocolate sauce, for instance. Then there was that cocktail (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/dining/blue-cocktails-blure-butterfly-pea-flower.html#:~:text=Offer%20a%20cocktail%20that%20changes,is%20the%20butterfly%20pea%20flower.\">the \"Disco Sour\"</a>) that changed color when blended with citrus, thanks to the incorporation of butterfly pea flower tea, which is a pH-sensitive ingredient. On the technology side, in 2014, MIT's Media Matters Lab <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/computational-food/overview/\">experimented with</a> a shape-changing fork that inflated depending on how fast a person was eating. Another fork design was outfitted with electronics, in which an LED changed from red to green when users touched a food item with a conductive element, indicating how much water was in the food.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977354#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977354&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fb52bd7a0c106147b74671943e6b25ec17e8043ab0dbf1d90c0e3c18282cd056","category":"Tech"}
