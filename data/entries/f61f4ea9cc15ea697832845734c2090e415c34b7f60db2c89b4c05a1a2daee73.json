Anderson and starring Milla Jovovich. But those films were only loosely based on the games, keeping a few primary characters and the basic concept, but little else. Sony Pictures just dropped the official trailer for its upcoming reboot,Â <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil:_Welcome_to_Raccoon_City\"><em>Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City</em></a>, and it looks like it will hew much more closely to the source material than its big-screen predecessors.</p>\n<p><strong>(Some spoilers for the first two games in the franchise below, but no major reveals.)</strong></p>\n<p>The sixth and final film in the Anderson series was released fairly recently, in 2016. But the franchise made a ton of money, so naturally a complete reboot was in the works by early 2017, with Johannes Roberts (<em>47 Meters Down</em>) at the helm.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802183#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802183&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f61f4ea9cc15ea697832845734c2090e415c34b7f60db2c89b4c05a1a2daee73","category":"Tech"}
