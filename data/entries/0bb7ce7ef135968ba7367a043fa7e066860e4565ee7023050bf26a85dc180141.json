He added that while the battery pack is quite thick, its rounded edges make it comfortable to hold.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPriced at $99 in the United States, the MagSafe Battery Pack attaches magnetically to the back of the iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, or iPhone 12 Pro Max, providing additional hours of battery life. Apple says the battery pack is able to wirelessly charge the iPhone at up to 5W on the go, or at up to 15W when the battery pack is connected to a 20W or higher power adapter with a Lightning to USB-C cable.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you attach the MagSafe Battery Pack to an iPhone 12 running iOS 14.7 or later, it will automatically begin to charge the iPhone and a charging status will appear on the Lock screen. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/13/apple-seeds-ios-14-7-rc-to-developers/\">iOS 14.7 is currently in beta</a> and should be released within the next few days.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe MagSafe Battery Pack can be <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJWY3AM/A/magsafe-battery-pack\">ordered on Apple's online store</a> in a white color only and currently has a late July delivery estimate.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe Battery Pack</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/19/magsafe-battery-pack-photos/\">Photos of Apple's New MagSafe Battery Pack Provide First Look at Thickness</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/photos-of-apples-new-magsafe-battery-pack-provide-first-look-at-thickness.2304741/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lHkCb2ZUZD8:04iIpz9G5-c:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lHkCb2ZUZD8:04iIpz9G5-c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/lHkCb2ZUZD8\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0bb7ce7ef135968ba7367a043fa7e066860e4565ee7023050bf26a85dc180141","category":"Apple"}
