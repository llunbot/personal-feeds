From the side, it looks downright normal for a time-trial helmet. But head-on, its bell-shaped flare cuts a unique profile that Rudy Project says will make you faster…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rudy Project Wingdream time trial aero helmet</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div><blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6yXrXdMqv7/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6yXrXdMqv7/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Team Bahrain Victorious (@teambahrainvictorious)</a></p></div></blockquote></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We already got a sneak peek at the new Rudy Project Wingdream in camo. Sneaking in back in the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/is-dark-helmet-illegal-uci-reevaluates-time-trial-helmet-design-rules/\" target=\"_blank\">UCI aero helmet controversy</a> at Tirreno-Adriatico over some of the many spaceship-inspired TT helmets. The sharp-edged Wingdream slipped pretty much under the radar. Plus, Rudy Project didn’t tack on any of the dubious extras, not focused on rider safety, that sparked the UCI’s ire. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_Giro-photo-by-Sprint-Cycling_side-view.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_Giro-photo-by-Sprint-Cycling_side-view.jpg\" alt=\"Rudy Project Wingdream time trial aero helmet side, Giro d'Italia race photos by Sprint Cycling\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_Giro-photo-by-Sprint-Cycling_side-view.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_Giro-photo-by-Sprint-Cycling_side-view-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_Giro-photo-by-Sprint-Cycling_side-view-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_Giro-photo-by-Sprint-Cycling_side-view-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_Giro-photo-by-Sprint-Cycling_side-view-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_Giro-photo-by-Sprint-Cycling_side-view-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Giro photos by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sprintcycling/\" target=\"_blank\">Sprint Cycling</a>/<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rudyproject/\" target=\"_blank\">Rudy Project</a>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, Rudy Project says the helmet’s unique shape can save a rider “<em>almost 10 watts compared to the previous Wing model, equivalent to 4 seconds per 10km, or more than a minute over an Ironman distance</em>” (<em>of 180km</em>). At a constant 200W rider output for that full distance, Rudy Project says the new Wingdream would cut 5 minutes &amp; 6 seconds off a rider’s time vs. a traditional road helmet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"922\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet-1536x922.jpg\" alt=\"Rudy Project Wingdream time trial aero helmet, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The official Giro debut doesn’t really reveal too much detail – besides the riders getting the Team Bahrain Victorious colors.

And the new Wingdream is the product of 2 years of R&amp;D to improve over the short-tailed Wing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_angled-rear-view.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1023\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_angled-rear-view-1536x1023.jpg\" alt=\"Rudy Project Wingdream time trial aero helmet, angled rear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_angled-rear-view-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_angled-rear-view-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_angled-rear-view-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_angled-rear-view-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_angled-rear-view-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_angled-rear-view-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_angled-rear-view.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new helmet opts for a more open lower half of the shell. It gets straight edges compared to the previous curving shape meant to tuck against a rider’s shoulder and back. The result of the more open design is apparently even better direction of the turbulent airflow over the rider’s shoulders and back for “superior aerodynamic penetration”.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_inside-view.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_inside-view-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Rudy Project Wingdream time trial aero helmet, inside tech details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_inside-view-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_inside-view-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_inside-view-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_inside-view-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_inside-view-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_inside-view-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_inside-view.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rudy Project says rider safety is still the first concern with the new Wingdream – with conventional strap, buckle &amp; dial retention.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_Bell-shaped-front.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_Bell-shaped-front.jpg\" alt=\"Rudy Project Wingdream time trial aero helmet, fronty bell-shaped\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_Bell-shaped-front.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_Bell-shaped-front-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_Bell-shaped-front-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_Bell-shaped-front-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_Bell-shaped-front-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Project-Wingdream-time-trial-aero-helmet_Bell-shaped-front-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But they also recognize that aero helmets must deliver ventilation to keep a racer from overheating – whether during a 40-minute TT or several hours in a triathlon.
