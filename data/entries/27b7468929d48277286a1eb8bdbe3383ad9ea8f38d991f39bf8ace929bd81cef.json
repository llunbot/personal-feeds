The injections also have to be timed in response to eating and exercise, as any consumption or use of glucose has to be managed.</p>\n<p>Research into glucose-responsive insulin, or “smart” insulin, hopes to improve the quality of life for people with type I diabetes by developing a form of insulin that needs to be injected less frequently, while providing control of blood-glucose levels over a longer period of time.</p>\n<p>A team at Zhejiang University, China, has recently released a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-023-01138-7%23\">study</a> documenting an improved smart insulin system in animal models—the current work doesn’t involve any human testing. Their insulin was able to regulate blood-glucose levels for a week in diabetic mice and minipigs after a single subcutaneous injection.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992850#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992850&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"27b7468929d48277286a1eb8bdbe3383ad9ea8f38d991f39bf8ace929bd81cef","category":"Tech"}
