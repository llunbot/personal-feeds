Kits will include a headset, bottom bracket, and King wheels, with configurations for all-road, gravel, and mountain bikes available. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jay Sycip, Chris King’s Design Manager said, “<em>The inaugural MADE show is here in Portland, so we just had to do something special, something we hadn’t done before, and that was the motivation for Splash. It will be both a component finish and a soft goods collection. There will be a LOT of King components and wheels on bikes all around the show. For us, it’s like a homecoming</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris King has been anodizing bicycle components as early as 1988, with limited colors being added and removed from the line each season. Remember earlier this year, they brought back their prized 1988 color, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/chris-king-3d-violet-purple-hubs-headset/\" target=\"_blank\">3D Violet</a>… nothin’ says “bling” like purple anno. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sycip continued, “<em>We’ve seen what others have done with splatter and drip anodize effects in the past, not just on bike parts, but in other industries as well, and wanted to create a more refined version incorporating some favorite colors from our palette. Our Matte Bourbon color was incredibly popular and a favorite of many here at King, and we loved the way that warm bronzy color worked with many paint and component choices, especially on handmade bikes, and how well it complemented vibrant color accents. We wanted to take the subtle sophistication of a bronze base color and add a ‘Splash’ of something bright and complementary to take it to the next level: our Matte Turquoise</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Splash colorway will make its global “in-person” debut on show bikes that were produced for the MADE Show this week. The Chris King booth will be displaying Splash-themed bikes from Mosiac, Argonaut, and Tomii. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Much? </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Chris-King-Splash-build-kit.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Chris-King-Splash-build-kit-800x800.jpeg\" alt=\"Chris King Splash build kit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Chris-King-Splash-build-kit-800x800.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Chris-King-Splash-build-kit-297x297.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Chris-King-Splash-build-kit-120x120.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Chris-King-Splash-build-kit-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Chris-King-Splash-build-kit.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo c.
