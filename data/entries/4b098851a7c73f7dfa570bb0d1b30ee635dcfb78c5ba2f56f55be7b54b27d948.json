These Galileo missions will occur later this year. The satellites, which each weigh about 700 kg, will be launched into an orbit about 22,000 km above the planet.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011210#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011210&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4b098851a7c73f7dfa570bb0d1b30ee635dcfb78c5ba2f56f55be7b54b27d948","category":"Tech"}
