This is the first time Canyon’s premier CFR tier has been an option for the Grail.</p>\n<p>Pricing starts at £2,599 / $2,699 / €2,699 / AU$4,199 for the Grail CF SL 7 and rises to £9,500 / $8,999 / €10,000 / AU$15,100 for the limited-edition Grail CFR LTD.</p>\n<p>How does it ride?

Canyon says it settled on 42mm because it believes that’s generally the maximum tyre width used by gravel racers.</p>\n<p>According to Canyon, the tyre clearance enables riders to use up to a 52/36t <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cranksets/\">crankset</a> without the frame having to use a dropped or longer chainstay.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Grail CFR Di2 review (13 of 25)\" title=\"Canyon Grail CFR Di2 review (13 of 25)\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You can mount a top tube bag to the Grail.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>Like its other road models, the Grail continues to use the BB86 press-fit <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">bottom bracket standard</a>.</p>\n<p>The frame has mounting points on the top tube and underneath the down tube.</p>\n<p>Canyon is including its custom ‘Defend Fast Fenders’ on the Grail, which are effectively quick-release alloy <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mudguards-fenders-a-buyers-guide/\">mudguards</a>.

This means you’re set with whatever width your bike comes with.</p>\n<p>The new bar features a 5-degree backsweep on the tops and a subtle drop from the stem. Canyon says this is a natural position for your hands to fall into to reduce pressure on your wrists and keep your elbows tighter to the body. The 5-degree flare at the hoods widens to 16 degrees at the drops.</p>\n<p>Canyon is also offering a ‘pro’ fit aftermarket CP0047 handlebar that is 40cm wide at the hoods with 15mm more drop to replicate a negative-angled stem, but these will have to be purchased separately.</p>\n<p>The new bar’s standard 1 ⅛ steerer and (simpler) cable routing means you could also swap to a wide variety of aftermarket handlebar options.</p>\n<p>The Double Drop Bar will be available in 42cm to 46cm widths and 60 to 80mm stem lengths. If you want a stem length longer than 80mm, you’ll have to buy an aftermarket CP0047 bar where you have stem options up to 110mm.</p>\n<h3>Gear Groove</h3>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure>\n<div>\n    \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/10/505712-230911GrailMY24CAMGIF02-09eeae-original-1696329326-2496915-e1697021558446.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Canyon Gear Groove with bike computer\" title=\"Canyon Gear Groove with bike computer\" />\n</div>    <figcaption>\n        <div>\n    <figcaption>\n        <span>The Gear Groove can be adapted to fit a computer. </span>\n    </figcaption>\n    <span>\n                    <i>Canyon</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      </div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure>\n<div>\n    \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/10/505713-230911GrailMY24CAMgif03-838684-original-1696329326-23fae04-e1697021629973.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Canyon Gear Groove with phone\" title=\"Canyon Gear Groove with phone\" />\n</div>    <figcaption>\n        <div>\n    <figcaption>\n        <span>You can mount a phone.</span>\n    </figcaption>\n    <span>\n                    <i>Canyon</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      </div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure>\n<div>\n    \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/10/505714-230911GrailMY24CAMgif04-848353-original-1696329326-0e277d0-e1697021651774.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Canyon Gear Groove with aero extensions\" title=\"Canyon Gear Groove with aero extensions\" />\n</div>    <figcaption>\n        <div>\n    <figcaption>\n        <span>You can also mount aero extensions to the bar. </span>\n    </figcaption>\n    <span>\n                    <i>Canyon</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      </div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure>\n<div>\n    \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/10/505711-230911GrailMY24CAMgif01-e11d81-original-1696329326-85278ed-e1697021669703.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Canyon Gear Groove\" title=\"Canyon Gear Groove\" />\n</div>    <figcaption>\n        <div>\n    <figcaption>\n        <span>Or you can leave it bare. </span>\n    </figcaption>\n    <span>\n                    <i>Canyon</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThe cockpit features what Canyon calls a Gear Groove, which is an indented slot moulded into the cockpit’s centre.\n<p>This is where accessories can be mounted to the Grail, such as a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-computers/\">bike computer</a>, phone, lights or even aero extensions.</p>\n<p>Only the Double Drop bar on the Grail CFR and Grail CF SLX features the Gear Groove – it is absent on the cheaper Grail CF SL CP0045 cockpit.</p>\n<p>The aero extensions for the Grail are borrowed directly from the brand’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/canyon-speedmax-cf-8-0-di2-review/\">Speedmax</a> time trial bike, with the base wings broadened to better suit gravel riding.</p>\n<h2>Frame storage</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Grail CFR Di2 review – storage compartment details\" title=\"Canyon Grail CFR Di2 review – storage compartment details\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Grail incorporates downtube storage.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The new Grail comes with Canyon’s Aero LOAD System, which is a compartment you can access via a hatch in the down tube.</p>\n<p>The system includes a LOAD Tool Pack, which can accept riding spares.
