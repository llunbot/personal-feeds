That product is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Docking-Wireless-Charging-ThinkPad/dp/B0BNZ4D72B/\" target=\"_blank\">Anker 675 docking station and monitor stand, which is now $200 on Amazon for Prime members</a>, a $50 discount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2232924/anker-675-usbc-12in1-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Anker docking station and monitor stand got a 4-star rating</a> from us and even our Editors’ Choice award. Our expert was thrilled about the combination, the speed delivered by the integrated USB ports, and the fact that the HDMI port supports 4K at 60Hz.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is such a versatile tool, featuring a 100W max USB-C for connecting your laptop, as well as two other USB-C ports. There are also three USB-A ports so you can plug in all your peripheral or charging devices. There’s even an SD/microSD card slot if you need to move data from your camera, for instance. The monitor stand comes with another super cool feature: a wireless charging pad. Located in the right-hand area, the pad delivers a 10W max charge for your iPhone or AirPods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And since this is more than an Anker docking station, we should also discuss how useful it is to have a monitor stand, bringing the monitor higher up and at a more appropriate eye level. This will hopefully lessen the strain on your eyes and your neck after all those long hours. Grab one of these amazing <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Docking-Wireless-Charging-ThinkPad/dp/B0BNZ4D72B/\" target=\"_blank\">Anker docking stations for $200 at Amazon</a>, but keep in mind this is a Prime-only deal, so you’ll need a subscription. If you don’t have one yet, you can start a 30-day free trial.</p>\n\n\n<span>Snatch this Anker docking station and monitor stand for $50 off</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Docking-Wireless-Charging-ThinkPad/dp/B0BNZ4D72B/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"040a674e86aa8959746e8c2f6ce23df6e161f24f051fe8dde652303e4f17e7d1","category":"Apple"}
