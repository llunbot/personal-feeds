Whether for practical, economic, environmental, or fitness reasons, we salute you!</p><p>To help you make that commute as easy as possible, we’re sharing our favorite accessories to turn whatever bike you’re riding into the ultimate back-to-school machine. From the best backpack for biking to a locking axle to prevent wheel theft, you’re covered whether you’re pedaling to the local elementary school or riding from the dorm room to the lab.</p><p><em>Note: Rather than our usual list of superlatives (‘best overall,’ and so on), we’ve just listed the accessories that we’re kitting out our kids (and ourselves) with as we get back to

graders to Ph.D. candidates.</p><p>The Cordura canvas is weather resistant, and handles all but the lengthiest torrential downpours. The roll-top makes it easy to stuff your bag full if you have to run to the grocery store after class or bring a yoga mat to the gym, but you can also buckle it down if you’re late for class and need to get a bit more aero on the bike.</p><p>And it’s fun to design: Choose from thousands of colors and fabrics, adding reflective and rain-repellent accents as well as fun colors and patterns. Your backpack will be easy to spot in a crowd, and uniquely yours.</p><p>This editor has the smaller&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.timbuk2.com/pages/customizer#/product/26-custom-mini-prospect-backpack/size/2/customize\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Custom Tuck Backpack</a> ($99) that’s held up to eight years of carrying books, computers, groceries, and pretty much anything else you can think of, and it’s still in perfect condition. But we recommend this larger Prospect model because it adds a large, external front pocket and padded laptop sleeve inside.</p><p>For mini-commuters—i.e short kiddos—<a href=\"https://www.timbuk2.com/pages/customizer#/product/26-custom-mini-prospect-backpack/size/2/customize\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Timbuk2 has a mini-version of this pack</a>.

bags on either side of your rear wheel.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FIAVHE/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Topeak Explorer</a> can hold 57 pounds of cargo—enough for even the densest course reading—and it has an integrated spring clip to help secure any extra cargo on top of the rack. You can also opt to add a rear basket if you want to stick with your regular backpack and skip getting panniers right away.</p><p>Available in a range of sizes, most bikes can use the basic version, which fits 26″, 27.5″ (650B), and 700C wheels. You’ll need to specify disc brake or non-disc brake version, though, and just make sure your bike has the necessary mounting points (see FAQ at bottom section for details).</p><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $50<br><strong>PROS</strong>:&nbsp;Great to carry bags without getting sweaty, easy to use<br><strong>CONS</strong>:&nbsp;Requires installation, won’t be able to use rear fender<br></p><h3><span>&nbsp;<strong>EASY FENDER</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=b5770911-39dc-46ac-ba0f-b49dbb30c5c7&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fsks-x-blade-fender-rear-sks0033\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SKS Rear Blade Fender</a>&nbsp;</span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102801/sks-rear-blade-fender-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102801/sks-rear-blade-fender-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories.jpg\" alt=\"sks rear blade fender best back to school bike accessories\" width=\"1600\" height=\"756\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102801/sks-rear-blade-fender-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102801/sks-rear-blade-fender-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-297x140.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102801/sks-rear-blade-fender-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-800x378.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102801/sks-rear-blade-fender-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-120x57.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102801/sks-rear-blade-fender-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-768x363.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102801/sks-rear-blade-fender-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-1536x726.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102801/sks-rear-blade-fender-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-696x329.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102801/sks-rear-blade-fender-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-1068x505.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102801/sks-rear-blade-fender-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-889x420.jpg 889w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102801/sks-rear-blade-fender-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102801/sks-rear-blade-fender-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102801/sks-rear-blade-fender-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-297x140.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102801/sks-rear-blade-fender-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-800x378.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102801/sks-rear-blade-fender-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-120x57.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102801/sks-rear-blade-fender-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-768x363.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102801/sks-rear-blade-fender-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-1536x726.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102801/sks-rear-blade-fender-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-696x329.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102801/sks-rear-blade-fender-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-1068x505.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102801/sks-rear-blade-fender-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-889x420.jpg 889w\"></a></p><p>For those rainy days, a fender is going to make a big difference in your comfort in getting to class.

If you’re leaving your bike locked outside of school, especially in higher crime areas, then you need a locking axle on the wheels if you want to keep them.</p><p>These replace your quick-release skewers and require a special key or tool (or both) to remove, and more time, all of which are very strong deterrents for would-be thieves.&nbsp;Left to right, here are our three favorite options:</p><p><strong>Hexlox Skewers<br></strong>Perhaps the sleekest, lightest, and coolest anti-theft wheel skewers out there, the Hexlox bolts use a proprietary plug-and-key system to effectively block access to the bolt. Meaning, you can’t insert an Allen wrench to loosen the axle until you’ve removed the plug…and you absolutely can not do that unless you have the key. You can even buy just the plug-and-key sets to secure your seatpost, saddle, stem, and almost any other part on your bike! MSRP is $70 for a complete set, available <a href=\"https://hexlox.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">directly from Hexlox</a>. Or <a href=\"https://robertaxleproject.com/product/hexlox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">just add the cap</a> to your existing thru axle!</p><p><strong>Pinhead Quick Release Skewers</strong><br>Similar to Hexlox, except using a keyed pattern on a matching lever that acts as both key and tool to remove the bolt. Not quite as stealthy, but a little more affordable at $60 MSRP. Available through <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001Y9VNS4/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=0d15472d-796a-41f7-afb4-32437118891b&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fequipment%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-racks-fenders-locks%2Fbike-locks%2Fpinhead-quick-release-lock-2-piece-set%2Fp%2F26952%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trek Bikes</a>.</p><p><strong>ABUS NutFix<br></strong>These work a bit differently in that you’ll need a thin 8mm wrench (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CVC5BDL/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">like these</a>) to remove your wheel, and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2017/02/16/abus-nutfix-security-wheels-seatposts-now-available/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the NutFix caps</a> simply prevent access to that bolt while the bike is upright &amp; locked to a rack. Meaning, you’ll need to lay your bike flat on the ground for the cap to lift and allow access to the bolt, and we doubt any thief will figure that out. MSRP is $70 for the set, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J9IG2IM/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">available on Amazon</a>. They also make <a href=\"https://www.sears.com/search=ABUS%20NUTFIX%20SOLID%20AXLE%202%20PACK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">larger versions</a> for the bolt-on wheels commonly found on 20″ – 26″ kids’ bikes, must make sure you order the correct M8, M9 or M10 version to match the solid axle’s size!</p><p>All three of these brands also make locking seatpost bolts, too!</p><h3><span>&nbsp;<strong>LIGHT SET</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PPSN8GW/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Knog Plugger Twinpack</a>&nbsp;</span></h3><p><a

They’re not just so you can see where you’re going… a bright blinky light makes it easier for drivers to spot you, and helps keep you safe.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PPSN8GW/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Knog Plugger Twinpack</a> with front and rear lights is the perfect budget-friendly option. They’re easy to charge with USB cables and have really long battery life in “flash” modes, and they&nbsp;attach with a simple silicone band that can be replaced if broken, so they’re ideal if you’re switching bikes, running late, or you don’t want to leave them on your bike while in class.

First, it’s exceptionally squishy and comfortable without slipping or sliding around on the seat. Second, it’s 100% waterproof, so if it does rain while you’re in class, you can just peel it off and you’ll have a dry saddle for the ride home…that’s way better than the plastic bag you see stuck over some seats!</p><p>And, if you’re riding your road or mountain bike to class, this makes it way more comfy for commuting without padded bike shorts on.

But of course, not everyone wants to show up to class in full spandex. Thankfully, there’s a middle option: A chamois liner, which looks like underwear but offers a bit of padding and comfort under your jeans while you pedal.</p><p>The women’s version of the Club Ride shorts—the June—has a three-inch inseam and three millimeter thick chamois. Just enough to make your ride to school more comfortable without adding bulk. It’s available in teal and black in XS to XL. The men’s Johnson version is similar, but with a slightly longer inseam. It’s available in blue and black in S to XL.</p><p>(Remember, you will want to bring a change of underwear to school with you and swap out of your chamois once you’re there!)</p><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $35<br><strong>PROS</strong>:&nbsp;Keeps you comfortable for a longer ride<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Need to change at school<br></p><h3><span>&nbsp;<strong>DORM STORAGE RACK</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XXSHGWR/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bike Nook Bicycle Stand</a>&nbsp;</span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories.jpg\" alt=\"nook bike stand best back to school bike accessories\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1160\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-297x215.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-800x580.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-120x87.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-768x557.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-1536x1114.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-696x505.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-1068x774.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-579x420.jpg 579w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-324x235.jpg 324w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-297x215.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-800x580.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-120x87.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-768x557.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-1536x1114.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-696x505.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-1068x774.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-579x420.jpg 579w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03102741/nook-bike-stand-best-back-to-school-bike-accessories-324x235.jpg 324w\"></a></p><p>In a dorm room, you almost certainly won’t have space for a wall mount or for a full bike rack, so how can you get your bike out of the way?

You’ll want to consider the length of your commute and what the weather is typically like during the school year. If it’s hot or you’re riding a longer way, consider installing a rear rack and opting for panniers rather than a backpack. We’ve included some pannier options that can be used as backpacks or tote bags so they’re easy to bring from the bike to the classroom. But plenty of bike-to-schoolers will use backpacks, and we’ve included our favorite option for that as well.</p><p><strong>What should I bring with me?</strong><br>Like any ride, a bike-to-school commute could require some tools along the way. Make sure you have what you need to fix a flat: A patch kit, a spare tube, a mini-pump, and tire levers. You’ll also want to have a multi-tool for making quick adjustments.</p><p>But you’ll also want to consider bringing a good lock if you’re leaving your bike outside, and a set of front and rear lights, especially if you sometimes head home after dark.</p><p><strong>What kind of bike should I use to ride to school?</strong><br>It depends on the type and duration of your commute, but generally, whatever bike you have currently is the best bike to ride to school! Just try it for a few days to see how it feels. You may realize that it’s a long ride to make on your old hybrid bike and a road bike or e-bike would be faster and easier.</p><p>Or you may find you’d prefer something more upright and comfortable, like a classic step-through commuter, if you’re wearing a stuffy school uniform and only pedaling a mile or two.</p><p>Either way, we’d say keep it simple. An alloy frame will hold up to rain better than steel, but a modern chromoly steel bike is fine, too. Just take care of it, and maybe slap a few stickers on the top tube to protect it from banging against the bike rack. We’d also recommend using <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/08/17/best-bike-chain-lubes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a good wax-based chain lube</a> as it’ll stay a <em>LOT</em> cleaner, making it less likely to leave a greasy mark on your pant leg.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23080554/Ritchey-Ascent-Mountain-bike-2022-7.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23080554/Ritchey-Ascent-Mountain-bike-2022-7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23080554/Ritchey-Ascent-Mountain-bike-2022-7.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23080554/Ritchey-Ascent-Mountain-bike-2022-7-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23080554/Ritchey-Ascent-Mountain-bike-2022-7-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23080554/Ritchey-Ascent-Mountain-bike-2022-7-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23080554/Ritchey-Ascent-Mountain-bike-2022-7-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23080554/Ritchey-Ascent-Mountain-bike-2022-7-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23080554/Ritchey-Ascent-Mountain-bike-2022-7-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23080554/Ritchey-Ascent-Mountain-bike-2022-7-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23080554/Ritchey-Ascent-Mountain-bike-2022-7.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23080554/Ritchey-Ascent-Mountain-bike-2022-7.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23080554/Ritchey-Ascent-Mountain-bike-2022-7-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23080554/Ritchey-Ascent-Mountain-bike-2022-7-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23080554/Ritchey-Ascent-Mountain-bike-2022-7-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23080554/Ritchey-Ascent-Mountain-bike-2022-7-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23080554/Ritchey-Ascent-Mountain-bike-2022-7-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23080554/Ritchey-Ascent-Mountain-bike-2022-7-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23080554/Ritchey-Ascent-Mountain-bike-2022-7-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p><strong>How do I attach a Rack or Fenders to my bike?</strong><br>If your bike has eyelets (aka Bosses, rack mounts, or fender mounts) near the dropouts on the frame and fork, and some higher up near the seat post clamp or fork crown, chances are you can use the bolt-on style rack like the Topeak one we recommend here.</p><p>If not, you’ll want to look at universal racks like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N6RORTM/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thule Tour Rack</a> and its <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ASSQJYU/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">optional side frames</a> if you want to add panniers.

You don’t want to race there because you’ll get hot and sweaty…not a great look for first period.</p><p>Find spots to lock your bike, or email the school principal or administrative assistant to see if there’s a spot inside where you can store your bike (you’ll still want to lock it up inside, though). And on your first day of riding to school, leave early enough that you have a buffer of 10 to 15 minutes so you have plenty of time to cool down, get your bike locked, and get to class.</p><p><strong>What about tips for college kids riding to class?</strong><br>Keep your head up and pay attention to your surroundings! This editor fractured her cheekbone in college when she got doored while riding to class (and running a little late).</p><p>College campuses are often packed with students in a hurry: Pedestrians will dart out in front of you, doors will swing open without the driver checking to see if anyone is coming, and buses sometimes aren’t paying close attention to what’s happening alongside them.
