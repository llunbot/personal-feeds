Well, you get another G303. But this time, it's called the <a href=\"https://fave.co/3IPFigM\" target=\"_blank\">Logitech G G303 Shroud Edition</a>. It's way more powerful and expensive ($130 MSRP) than its predecessor, and it's not for everyone.</p>\n<p>Some of the changes made to the G303 were necessary for the mouse to compete in today's gaming landscape. At 2.6 oz (75 g), it's ready for first-person shooters and long sessions. At the same time, it avoids the aggressive sub-2-oz (57 g) ultralight category.</p>\n<p>The G303 Shroud Edition is named so because it was made to the specifications of pro <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/shroud\" target=\"_blank\">streamer</a> Michael \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/shroud\" target=\"_blank\">Shroud</a>\" Grzesiek. What that means for you, besides some subtle Shroud branding on the mouse, is that you get a wider, flatter device. You'll need bigger hands to find comfort here, and even then, the mouse's pointy edges may turn you off. But if you're bigger-handed and have been seeking a wireless gaming mouse for your fingertip or claw grip, you may find some reasons to pick up the Shroud.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818672#p3\">Read 36 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818672&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9b0a4fb678668689345844d810ca7c95f672f5a042c33cf365d3748e6dc6daad","category":"Tech"}
