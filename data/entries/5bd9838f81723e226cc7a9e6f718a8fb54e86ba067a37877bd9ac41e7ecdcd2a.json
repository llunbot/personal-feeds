Apple Invites takes it all even further. It's got big beautiful cards, translucent cells, big bold buttons, and an emphasis on content. It feels so clearly like a hint of what is to come in a future iOS update.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/apple-invites-screenshots.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" /><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-Sports-App-Preview-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1961\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nIt seems like a reasonable possibility that this \"glassy\" design could extend to other iOS 19 apps and interfaces, although this is purely speculation for now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple should announce iOS 19 at WWDC 2025 in June.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 19</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/06/apple-invites-app-hints-at-ios-19-redesign/\">Apple's New Invites App Hints at iOS 19's Rumored Redesign</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-new-invites-app-hints-at-ios-19s-rumored-redesign.2448901/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5bd9838f81723e226cc7a9e6f718a8fb54e86ba067a37877bd9ac41e7ecdcd2a","category":"Apple"}
