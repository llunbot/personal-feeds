According to <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/12/11/m4-macbook-air-leaked-in-macos-sequoia-152-update-regulatory-documents\">AppleInsider</a>, regulatory documents that they obtained mention a “Front Ultra Wide Camera” for the upcoming MacBook Air. That’s different from the 1080p FaceTime camera in the current M3 MacBook Air, which could mean that the M4 MacBook Air will feature an upgraded camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the M4 MacBook Pro and M4 iMac, Apple upgraded the 1080p FaceTime camera to a 12MP Center Stage camera, so it’s not much of a leap to think that Apple will also outfit the M4 MacBook Air with a Center Stage camera as well. There was some speculation that Apple might not upgrade the Air’s camera to differentiate the laptop further from the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro, but that doesn’t seem to be the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AppleInsider also points out that references to the upcoming M4 MacBook Air are in the code of the macOS Sequoia 15.2 update that was released on Wednesday. That makes it practically certain that Apple will release the laptop, it’s just a matter of when (probably in the March-April-May timeframe). Apple released the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2259608/15-inch-macbook-air-m3-review.html\">M3 MacBook Air</a> in March of 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">Get the lowdown on the upcoming M4 MacBook Air</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"7da7a059a704eace0af1627d0d52a1170d90fb1486bb5d913c79a8a503134bcb","category":"Apple"}
