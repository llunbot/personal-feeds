However, Apple warned that, as preview versions of these apps, \"not all features may work as expected.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has provided no release notes for the latest updates, so we don't have a comprehensive list of changes and fixes. However, users on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/12yb81c/new_updates_for_the_windows_app_are_now_available/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=1\">Reddit</a> have discovered that the <a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/apple-music-preview/9PFHDD62MXS1\">Apple Music Preview</a> app now appears to include support for Windows 11 media controls and keyboard shortcuts, support for lyrics, and provides smoother continuous playback of consecutive lossless tracks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for the <a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/apple-devices-preview/9NP83LWLPZ9K\">Apple Devices Preview</a>, Apple has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1650790758385950720?s=46&amp;t=i7Bde0UGNMnolFc6LPuxZQ\">reportedly</a> removed mentions of the software that will run on its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/\">rumored mixed reality headset</a>. References to \"xrOS\" and \"RealityOS\" references are now gone. Apple internally called the headset software \"Reality OS\" or \"rOS\" when it was in development, then decided to update the public name to the less generic \"xrOS\" name, which stands for \"extended reality.\" Apple is expected to unveil its headset at WWDC in June. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is no information yet on what's new in the <a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/apple-tv-preview/9NM4T8B9JQZ1\">Apple TV Preview app</a>, but we will update this article when we learn more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNote that installing any of these apps will prevent iTunes for Windows from opening. As a result, other content types such as audiobooks and podcasts will be inaccessible until Apple releases a compatible version of iTunes or the user uninstalls the preview apps.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/windows/\">Windows</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/25/apple-updates-windows-preview-apps/\">Apple Releases Updates to Apple Music and TV Preview Apps for Windows</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-updates-to-apple-music-and-tv-preview-apps-for-windows.2387737/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"230f7d21ef31798eb4a7cb4f84aa88c6d9775dc3e0bbbf7e06a744b68d0b62fd","category":"Apple"}
