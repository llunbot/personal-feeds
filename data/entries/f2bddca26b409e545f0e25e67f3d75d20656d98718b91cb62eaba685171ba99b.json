The phone was announced <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/lenovo-puts-the-legendary-thinkpad-brand-on-a-phone-meet-the-thinkphone/\">in January</a> as a surprise expansion of the \"ThinkPad\" brand, and while there are likely lots of ideas you could come up with for a business-focused smartphone, the ThinkPhone appears to be just a regular Motorola phone without much in the way of unique features.</p>\n<p>It is going to be for sale, though! Lenovo announced the phone will be in the US this week for $699. Enterprise customers can order the device now, and starting April 28, it should be available unlocked <a href=\"https://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones-thinkphone/p\">from Motorola.com</a>.</p>\n<p>The SoC is last year's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 instead of the Gen 2 that's in most flagship phones. The display is a 6.6-inch, 2400×1080 OLED running at only 60 Hz, instead of the higher refresh rate most phones currently use. I suppose you could call 60 Hz \"businessy\" since it will stretch the 5000 mAh battery out a little longer. The phone has 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, 68 W wired charging, and 15 W wireless charging. There's an in-screen fingerprint reader, NFC, IP68 dust and water resistance, and Wi-Fi 6E compatibility.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934630#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934630&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f2bddca26b409e545f0e25e67f3d75d20656d98718b91cb62eaba685171ba99b","category":"Tech"}
