{"title":"2024 Apple Watch to Feature New Look, Blood Pressure Monitoring and Sleep Apnea Detection","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/apple-watch-2024-health-features/","date":1702828726000,"content":"Apple made few updates to the Apple Watch lineup in 2023, but the 2024 Apple Watch models are expected to include a new feature set that will make them much more appealing to consumers, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-17/apple-2024-plans-new-low-end-airpods-vision-pro-larger-iphone-16-oled-ipad-lq9jhed4\">said today in his Power On newsletter</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg\" width=\"2880\" height=\"1620\" />\r<br />\nAt least one Apple Watch model will feature an updated look, and while Gurman does not specify, it could be the standard Apple Watch that's getting a design update. Apple just introduced the Apple Watch Ultra in 2022, and while there are rumors of a larger microLED display for that device, current information suggests Apple won't be ready to add microLED until 2025 or 2026.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn prior reports, Gurman has said that Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/gurman-apple-watch-x-redesign-planned/\">working on a significant update</a> for the tenth anniversary of the Apple Watch. The Apple Watch was announced in September 2014, but it did not launch until April 2015, so it is a little unclear whether the \"tenth anniversary\" falls in 2024 or 2025. We are due for the \"Apple Watch Series 10\" in 2024, and with Gurman pointing to a design update next year, that could be the \"anniversary\" model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe updated Apple Watch could include a thinner design as well as a new magnetic mechanism for connecting bands, but the health features may be more appealing to customers. Gurman says that we can expect the next-generation version of the Apple Watch to detect hypertension and sleep apnea, conditions that affect millions of people.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHypertension will be detected through blood pressure monitoring done on the wrist, which is a notable feat of engineering. Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/2024-apple-watch-blood-pressure-sleep-apnea/\">said in November</a> that the Apple Watch will be able to tell the wearer if their blood pressure is trending upward so they can report the findings to a medical professional, but it will not provide specific systolic and diastolic measurements. A future version of the technology may be able to provide exact readings.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSleep apnea will be detected through sleep measurements and breathing patterns, letting users know if the condition is present. Detecting sleep apnea often requires a sleep study in an overnight sleep center, so the Apple Watch could relieve some of the friction in getting a diagnosis. More mild cases of sleep apnea may go unnoticed, which means at-home warnings about the condition could allow people who don't know they are afflicted to get help and improve their sleep.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple refreshes the Apple Watch on an annual basis, so we can expect the new model to come out right around September 2024 alongside the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> lineup.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/apple-watch-2024-health-features/\">2024 Apple Watch to Feature New Look, Blood Pressure Monitoring and Sleep Apnea Detection</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2024-apple-watch-to-feature-new-look-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-sleep-apnea-detection.2413982/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"eb081a0c297e21510d2a8654548c0ffd1b05d2010b2a9b8c00e0c17ecd766c0e","category":"Apple"}
