Apple also recently held discussions with OpenAI and has \nconsidered using its model, according to the people. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apple’s own LLM efforts seem directed toward on-device processing, but there are some AI tasks that require cloud computer, and Apple simply doesn’t have (and likely doesn’t want to build) the infrastructure for. <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2024/apple-releases-ai-research-paper-apple-gemini/\">As Ben Thompson noted</a> in today’s Stratechery daily update, it’s quite possible that Google alone could handle such features if built into iOS — OpenAI is currently struggling under load at times, without the veritable avalanche of traffic that would come from integration into iOS.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Alphabet shares rose as much as 7.4% on Monday as the markets \nopened in New York. It was the biggest intraday gain since Feb. 2, \n2023. Apple was up 2.2%. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bloomberg <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/apple_gpt_bloomberg\">gonna Bloomberg</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/18/gurman-apple-google-gemini\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b8cb686a1232bb2ba0bf6a4419f48f907c13013350176743c001c6091678258e","category":"Tech"}
