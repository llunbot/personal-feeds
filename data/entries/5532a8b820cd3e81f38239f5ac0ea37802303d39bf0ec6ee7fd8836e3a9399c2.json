The ‌iPhone 16e‌ offers up to 26 hours of video playback, which is the longest battery life in the 6.1-inch form factor.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iphone-16e-back.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1612\" height=\"907\" />\r<br />\nAlong with up to 26 hours of video playback, the ‌iPhone 16e‌ supports up to 21 hours of streaming video and up to 90 hours of audio playback.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nComparatively, the prior-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a> 3 offered up to 15 hours of video playback, while the similarly sized <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> offers up to 22 hours of video playback, which is four hours less than the 16e.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 16‌ and 16e have the same A18 chip inside with the exception of the GPU (4-core vs. 5-core for the 16) and the same display, so the main difference with power draw is the C1 modem chip. The standard ‌iPhone 16‌ has Qualcomm's modem chip, so it seems that Apple's modem offers some notable improvements to battery.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the ‌iPhone 16e‌ adopted a number of features from the ‌iPhone 16‌ models, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/iphone-16e-doesnt-have-magsafe/\">one curious exclusion</a>. Fast charging is supported with USB-C, but wireless charging is limited to 7.5W Qi speeds and there is no magnetic connection.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e\">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/iphone-16e-battery-life/\">iPhone 16e Has Longest Battery Life of Any 6.1-Inch iPhone</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16e-has-longest-battery-life-of-any-6-1-inch-iphone.2449722/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5532a8b820cd3e81f38239f5ac0ea37802303d39bf0ec6ee7fd8836e3a9399c2","category":"Apple"}
