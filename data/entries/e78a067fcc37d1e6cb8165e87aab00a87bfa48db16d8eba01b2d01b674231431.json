Kuo previously said key features of the new iPhone SE <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-iphone-se-2022-5g/\">will include 5G support</a> and a faster processor â€” <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/2022-iphone-se-a15-chip-5g/\">likely the A15 chip</a> that debuted in iPhone 13 models and the latest iPad mini.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new iPhone SE will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/30/iphone-se-3-release-date-rumor/\">released in the first quarter of 2022</a> specifically, according to Taiwanese research firm TrendForce. If this timeframe proves to be accurate, we can expect the device to be released by the end of March.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLooking farther ahead, rumors suggest that a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/apple-to-launch-new-iphone-se-models-2022-2023/\">fourth-generation iPhone SE is slated for launch in 2023</a> with more significant changes, including a larger display and 4GB of RAM. It's possible this larger iPhone SE will feature a design based on the iPhone XR.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe current iPhone SE launched in April 2020, with pricing starting at $399 for 64GB of storage.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE 2020</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">digitimes.com</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/09/iphone-se-3-suppliers-gearing-up/\">New iPhone SE Inches Closer to Launch as Suppliers Begin Preparing for Shipments</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-iphone-se-inches-closer-to-launch-as-suppliers-begin-preparing-for-shipments.2326820/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=yVf4CnTD02U:pAP_kbq8Yrs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=yVf4CnTD02U:pAP_kbq8Yrs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e78a067fcc37d1e6cb8165e87aab00a87bfa48db16d8eba01b2d01b674231431","category":"Apple"}
