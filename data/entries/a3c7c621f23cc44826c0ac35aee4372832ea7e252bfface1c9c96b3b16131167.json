It turns out the company has also made available a new <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU2G3AM/A/240w-usb-c-charge-cable-2-m?\">60W 1-meter USB-C Charge Cable ($19)</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU2G3AM/A/240w-usb-c-charge-cable-2-m?\">240W 2-meter USB-C Charge Cable ($29)</a>, designed for charging iPhone 15 models, iPads, and Macs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/USB-C-60w-240w-charge-cable.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nApple advertises the new woven charge cable with USB-C connectors on both ends \"ideal for charging, syncing, and transferring data between USB-C devices.\" It supports charging of up to 240 watts and transfers data at USB 2 rates. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nCompatible with all iPhone 15 models and Apple's latest iPad and Mac models, the cable can be paired with a compatible USB-C power adapter to charge the devices from a wall outlet and take advantage of fast-charging capabilities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the new standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are equipped with a USB-C port, data transfer over a cable remains limited to USB 2.0 speeds of up to 480 Mbps, which is equal to the Lightning port on previous iPhones. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe higher-end iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are also equipped with a USB-C port, but those devices support USB 3 data transfer speeds of up to 10 Gbps over a cable. For this reason, Apple made its previously-existing Thunderbolt 4 Pro cable available in a shorter one-meter size for $69. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks MacRumors forum member BeatCrazy!)</em><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c/\">USB-C</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/14/apple-selling-60w-and-60w-240w-usb-c-charge-cables/\">Apple Selling New 60W and 240W USB-C Woven Charge Cables</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-selling-new-60w-and-240w-usb-c-woven-charge-cables.2401676/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a3c7c621f23cc44826c0ac35aee4372832ea7e252bfface1c9c96b3b16131167","category":"Apple"}
