The journey covers 3,000 miles, meaning Itzler and his friends will need to average 214 miles a day relay style to get to Florida in time.</span></p>\n<p><span>The group has a goal of raising enough money to provide one bike and helmet per mile ridden for disadvantaged kids. One per mile means a goal of providing 3,000 bikes and helmets to Title 1 underserved third graders.</span></p>\n<p><span>Of course, this is done through a fundraiser partnered with the Bikes for Kids Foundation. Together, they claim that a donation of $135 is enough for a child to receive their own bike and helmet.</span></p>\n<p><span>The two-week ride across the United States starts on April 24th.
