These tips can help to surface hidden features, highlight brand new features, show a faster method of accomplishing a task, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/TipKit.jpg\" alt width=\"1628\" height=\"916\" />\r<br />\nTips may appear next to a button or other user interface element in an app at timely moments, providing contextual information about features. Of course, apps can already offer their own tips and helpful information, but Apple is now providing a native solution with a consistent design. Apple has a <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10229/\">WWDC session</a> with more details for developers interested in TipKit, but there is no documentation available yet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17, iPadOS 17, macOS Sonoma, watchOS 10, and tvOS 17 will be released to the public later this year, and more apps should start to incorporate TipKit over the coming months. All of the updates are available in beta now for anyone with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/developer-betas-free-to-download/\">free Apple developer account</a>, and public betas will be available in July.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/09/ios-17-tipkit/\">iOS 17 Apps Can Offer Tips to Help Users Discover Hidden Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-apps-can-offer-tips-to-help-users-discover-hidden-features.2392396/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"707e3680119cf0166d20c72af184b26f9fb07a6afef16f4c842074d0b93254fd","category":"Apple"}
