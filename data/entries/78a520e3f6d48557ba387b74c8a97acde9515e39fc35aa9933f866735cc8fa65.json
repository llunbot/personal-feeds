It was one of the first brands to switch from steel to aluminium frames and also one of the first to get into gravel bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cannondale-supersix-history\">original SuperSix</a> was a classic round tubed carbon road bike renowned for its ride quality and low weight and before that <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cannondale-50-years-of-pioneering-bike-design\">Cannondale’s alloy bikes</a> were prominent in the pro peloton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale introduced the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-systemsix-review\">SystemSix</a> in 2019 to fill a gap for an aero road bike in its range. But in the intervening period since, the SuperSix Evo has had <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-supersix-evo-review\">a radical makeover</a>, sprouting its own aero features. The current fourth generation SuperSix Evo is raced by the EF Education pro teams and claimed to have aerodynamics close to those of the SystemSix. Cannondale is not showing the SystemSix on its UK or US sites as of May 2025, although it’s still shown on its international and some other country-specific sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale was also an early proponent of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-endurance-road-bikes\">endurance bike</a> class. The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-synapse-carbon-1-rle-review\">Synapse</a> was launched 20 years ago, designed to offer a more comfortable ride for those who were not competing, but also used to good effect by the pros during cobbled races. Its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cannondale-synapse-2025\">sixth generation</a> was launched in May 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest generation Synapse comes in both carbon and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-aluminium-road-bikes\">aluminium </a>options, with the latter offering the most affordable entry into Cannondale’s disc brake road bike range. Cannondale continues to sell its CAAD alloy bikes too – we’ve more on the CAAD13 and CAAD Optimo below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do the current generation Cannondale SuperSix Evo, SystemSix and Synapse ranges stack up, what specs are available and at what prices? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on for a complete breakdown of Cannondale’s UK road bike offering and our recommendations on how to choose the best Cannondale road bike for you.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Cannondale SuperSix Evo vs SystemSix vs Synapse: Key features at a glance</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cannondale SuperSix Evo</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Aero/lightweight race bike</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Three frame grades: Lab71, Hi-Mod, standard</li>\n\n\n\n<li>BSA threaded bottom bracket</li>\n\n\n\n<li>30mm tyre clearance </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cannondale SystemSix</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Aggressively aero</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Two frame grades: Hi-Mod, standard</li>\n\n\n\n<li>PF30a bottom bracket</li>\n\n\n\n<li>More limited spec options than the SuperSix</li>\n\n\n\n<li>30mm tyre clearance</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cannondale Synapse</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Endurance road bike</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Two frame materials: carbon, alloy</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some carbon bike specs with SmartSense lights and radar powered by a central battery</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Internal cabling from handlebars into frame</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Internal frame storage</li>\n\n\n\n<li>42mm tyre clearance (carbon)/32mm (alloy)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"Cyclist banner saying 'the world's best cycling magazine, delivered to your door, click here to subscribe'\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-3-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'the best rides, bikes, kit and pro interviews every month, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-3-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-3-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-3-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-3-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-3-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-3-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-3-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cannondale SuperSix vs SystemSix vs Synapse: aerodynamics</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-12-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cannondale SuperSix Evo bicycle on woodland road\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-12-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-12-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-12-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-12-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-12-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-12-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-12-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-12-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-12.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale says that the current 2023 generation of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cannondale-supersix-evo-2023\">SuperSix Evo</a> is 12 watts more efficient than its predecessor at 45kph, despite the visual similarities, and that it’s more aero than many of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-aero-bikes\">best aero bikes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SuperSix Evo has Cannondale’s Delta Steerer design, which allows for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-integration\">internal cable routing</a> and also results in a narrow head tube to reduce drag. The rear of the bike is skinny too, so much so that the Shimano Di2 battery has to be housed inside the down tube as it won’t fit in the seat tube or seatpost. Cannondale offers aero bottles and cages on the bike, which it says actually make the SuperSix Evo more aero, although the cages can also accept a standard round bottle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SuperSix Evo has a one piece carbon bar and stem on higher specs, in contrast to the SystemSix, which has a separate proprietary HollowGram Knot bar and stem, allowing you to adjust the bar pitch through eight degrees.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cannondale-synapse-2025\">New Cannondale Synapse integrates SmartSense, adds storage and gets more aero</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cannondale-supersix-history\">The complete history of the Cannondale SuperSix</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-all-road-bikes\">Best all-road bikes 2025 reviewed</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cannondales-supersix-evo-2023-whats-changed\">Here’s every nerdy detail on Cannondale’s fourth generation SuperSix Evo frameset</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-endurance-road-bikes\">Best endurance road bikes 2025 reviewed for comfort on long rides</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\">Best road bikes 2025 reviewed and rated</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/02141355/cannondale_systemsix_1-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"cannondale_systemsix_1\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The SystemSix has deep aero tube sections throughout. It’s a design feature that newer aero road bikes, such as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/giant-propel-2023\">Giant Propel</a>, are moving away from in favour of a thinner seat tube that’s potentially more compliant. When reviewed, we reckoned that the SystemSix’s ride comfort was adequate rather than class-leading, even back in 2019, and aero bike design has moved on since then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carbon Synapse bikes have aero tube profiles as well. The top two specs of the Synapse share the one-piece bar/stem of the SuperSix and all carbon bikes use the same Delta steerer tube shape as the SuperSix Evo that allows for internal cabling. Other specs have a more standard separate alloy bar and stem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cannondale SuperSix vs SystemSix vs Synapse: standards</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cannondale SuperSix Evo bicycle\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale isn’t a brand to stick with the status quo and has over time used a number of proprietary designs in its bikes, from the Ai rear triangle and symmetrically dished rear wheel on its original <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-topstone-carbon-2-l-review\">Topstone</a> gravel bike to the 650b wheels and Lefty suspension fork on the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-slate-review\">Slate</a>. Both of these are <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-gravel-bike\">gravel bikes</a> and Cannondale was an early adopter of the gravel genre too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It developed the BB30 bottom bracket standard and was a big proponent of the advantages of a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/press-fit-vs-threaded-bb\">pressfit bottom bracket</a>, making the BB30 standard openly available to its competitors, to help encourage its take-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it’s something of a surprise that the fourth generation SuperSix Evo has reverted to a threaded <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bottom-bracket-standards-guide\">BSA bottom bracket</a> shell, which Cannondale says is both simple and reliable. It shouldn’t creak either. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Synapse also has a BSA threaded bottom bracket. The SystemSix retains a pressfit bottom bracket though, following the PF30a standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another area where Cannondale has played with a variant then reverted to a more standard design is thru-axles. The SystemSix has the Mavic Speed Release system, while both the SuperSix and Synapse now use a standard thru-axle design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also flirted with an ultra-narrow 25.4mm seatpost on a previous generation of the Synapse, while the current design has a standard width 27.2mm post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, the trend with the current generation of Cannondale bikes is to swap back to established industry standards, which improves interchangeability and increases the number of options if you want to change components, although its Delta steerer is a proprietary design.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cannondale SuperSix vs SystemSix vs Synapse: weight</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Mallorca_2735-970x645.webp\" alt=\"New Cannondale Synapse 2025 side-on view in front of fog\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Mallorca_2735-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Mallorca_2735-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Mallorca_2735-768x511.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Mallorca_2735-1536x1022.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Mallorca_2735-2048x1362.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Mallorca_2735-750x499.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Mallorca_2735-1140x758.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Mallorca_2735-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Mallorca_2735-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Mallorca_2735-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Cannondale</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale doesn’t in general quote complete bike weights. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some claimed frame weights for the SuperSix Evo.

The stack is comparable between the two bikes though. As you’d expect for an endurance bike, the Synapse is taller, although its reach is not dissimilar to the other two bikes. There are slight differences between the alloy and carbon Synapse frames’ geometry too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are subtle differences in other measurements too, such as the wheelbase, although these don’t consistently point to a difference in ride characteristics. Instead, the Synapse’s endurance focus is likely to come more from its in-built compliance zones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The differences in tyre clearance between Cannondale’s race and endurance bikes is more marked though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SuperSix Evo’s 30mm clearance is a little narrow by the standards of modern road race bikes. While some higher spec SuperSix Evo bikes make use of this with 28mm or 29mm tyres, many specs are equipped with 25mm tyres. All the SystemSix specs include 25mm tyres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years ago, that would have been considered on the wide side, but many race bikes are equipped with 28mm now, while <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/canyon-aeroad-ultimate-endurace-compared\">Canyon road race bikes</a>, for example, have a mixed 25mm front/28mm rear set-up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest generation Synapse Carbon goes wider, with 42mm tyre clearance and includes mudguard mounts, while the alloy Synapse’s tyre clearance is 32mm. Chainstay length is 5mm longer on the Synapse to accommodate the wider tyres and it should also give the bike a more planted ride feel than the SuperSix Evo and the SystemSix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Synapse range is equipped with 32mm tyres throughout. Giant too fits 32mm tyres to its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/giant-propel-tcr-defy\">Defy</a>, although the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/canyon-aeroad-ultimate-endurace-compared\">Canyon Endurace</a> is equipped with 30mms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cannondale SuperSix vs SystemSix vs Synapse: frame grades</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale offers three carbon frame grades, plus alloy, although not all carbon grades are available for each bike model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SuperSix Evo is offered with the top Lab71 frame. This uses higher grade carbon fibre and resin to reduce weight. Below that, both the SuperSix Evo and the SystemSix can be bought either in Hi-Mod or standard modulus carbon. As noted above, the Hi-Mod frames offer lower weight than the standard modulus option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest generation Synapse, for the first time, is offered with a Lab71 frameset option, as well as standard modulus carbon. The frame incorporates flex zones in the rear triangle, which increase vertical compliance and vibration damping.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cannondale SuperSix vs SystemSix vs Synapse: sizing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cannondale SuperSix Evo Lab71 is available in six sizes: 48, 51, 54, 56, 58 and 61. The SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod adds a size 44.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are just five sizes available in the UK for the SystemSix Hi-Mod aero bike: 51, 54, 56, 58 and 60, although the standard modulus frame adds 47 and 62 frame sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Synapse Carbon (expect for the Lab71 bike) is now offered in the same range of sizes as the SuperSix Evo: 48, 51, 54, 56, 58 and 61, while the Synapse alloy is available in sizes 44, 48, 51, 54, 56, 58 and 61.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cannondale SuperSix vs SystemSix vs Synapse: groupsets</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cannondale SuperSix Evo bicycle\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale’s UK specs are quite Shimano-heavy with relatively few SRAM specs sold. It offers the full range of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-shimano-groupsets\">Shimano groupsets</a> from 12-speed electronic Dura-Ace right down to 9-speed mechanical Sora across its range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are, though, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-red-axs-groupset-review-2024\">SRAM Red</a> specs available for the SuperSix Evo and SystemSix and a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-force-axs-review\">Force </a>spec for the SuperSix Evo, while the top spec Synapse has a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-red-xplr-axs-groupset-review\">SRAM Red XPLR AXS</a> 13-speed 1x groupset. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s increasingly common for bike makers to offer a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/best-power-meters-cycling\">power meter</a> on their higher spec bikes. Power meters are trickling down to mid-spec bikes too, particularly since SRAM offers single sided power meters at Rival and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/sram-apex-12-speed\">Apex </a>level which are comparatively inexpensive. But in Cannondale’s range it’s only the Lab71 grade SuperSix Evo and Synapse that have power meter options and only when equipped with SRAM Red.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cannondale SmartSense system</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0007-970x728.webp\" alt=\"New Cannondale Synapse 2025's front light\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0007-970x728.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0007-300x225.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0007-768x576.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0007-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0007-2048x1536.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0007-750x563.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0007-1140x855.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption>Cannondale</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale has upgraded the SmartSense system in its Synapse Carbon bike, but currently only offers it in its top spec Lab71 bike. SmartSense is Cannondale’s system that includes a front and rear light and a rearview radar developed in association with Garmin. They’re all powered by a single battery, which in the latest generation Synapse is housed within the down tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s fair to say that the jury is still out on SmartSense. On the one hand, it improves riders’ safety by making them more visible and providing an alert when vehicles approach from behind. On the other, it adds around 500g to the bike’s weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When he reviewed the previous generation <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-synapse-carbon-1-rle-review\">Cannondale Synapse Carbon 1 RLE</a> with the older SmartSense, tech editor Sam Challis said, ‘I couldn’t help feeling that the extra half a kilo neutered the bike uphill somewhat, toning down a ride feel that has always before felt pleasantly lively.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you like the idea of having an integrated light system, the SuperSix Evo and alloy Synapse frames are also compatible with SmartSense, although it’s not offered as standard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale equips its bikes with its own front wheel sensor, which measures the bike’s speed and distance travelled independently from a cycling computer. It links to the Cannondale phone app to remind you of service intervals too. On SmartSense-equipped bikes, it can also turn on the lights and radar automatically once you start to move.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cannondale CAAD alloy bike range</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/05062940/cannondale_caad13_1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cannondale_caad13_1\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t discount Cannondale’s alloy CAAD bikes. Before carbon fibre took over as the material of choice for performance road bikes, Cannondale was an early mover from steel to alloy and its CAAD range was one of the foremost pro-level race bikes, with its star rider the sprinter Mario Cipollini. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now incremented to CAAD13, Cannondale’s alloy bikes are still among the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-aluminium-road-bikes\">best aluminium road bikes</a> available.

There’s a more affordable rim brake <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/bike-we-like-cannondale-caad-optimo\">CAAD Optimo </a>range that sits below the CAAD13 and is priced from £900 to £1,300.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cannondale-synapse-2025\">New Cannondale Synapse integrates SmartSense, adds storage and gets more aero</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cannondale-supersix-history\">The complete history of the Cannondale SuperSix</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-all-road-bikes\">Best all-road bikes 2025 reviewed</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cannondales-supersix-evo-2023-whats-changed\">Here’s every nerdy detail on Cannondale’s fourth generation SuperSix Evo frameset</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-endurance-road-bikes\">Best endurance road bikes 2025 reviewed for comfort on long rides</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\">Best road bikes 2025 reviewed and rated</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Cannondale SuperSix vs SystemSix vs Synapse: ranges compared</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale’s road bikes are available in a good spread of specs.

look fast, there’s really only one choice: the SystemSix. If you want to go fast, the SuperSix Evo rivals Cannondale’s aero bike though and makes fewer compromises to achieve its speed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Sam Challis said in his SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod 1 review: “If Cannondale’s aero claims about the bike are to be believed, I’m struggling to see a case now for the brand’s SystemSix, which isn’t much faster and is over a kilo heavier.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SystemSix is showing its age too, while the SuperSix Evo’s recent refresh has kept it reasonably up to date, although not cutting-edge in design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the majority of riders on UK roads, the Synapse makes a good claim to be the Cannondale bike of choice though and Cannondale itself says it’s the best road bike in its range for most riders. It’s smoother and is more likely to suit the average non-racer. The 42mm tyre clearance gives the bike <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-all-road-bikes\">all-road</a> capabilities too, allowing you to fit treaded tyres and venture onto more gentle unpaved trails. The SmartSense system does add weight, but it’s only on the premium bike and if you ride with lights that’s extra mass that you’ll probably be clamping to your bike in any case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read our full reviews of the Cannondale <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-supersix-evo-review\">SuperSix Evo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-systemsix-review\">SystemSix</a> and our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cannondale-synapse-2025\">2025 Synapse Carbon</a> launch story to help you choose</em>, <em>and check out the full range at <a href=\"https://www.cannondale.com/en/bikes/road\" target=\"_blank\">cannondale.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/cannondale-supersix-systemsix-synapse\">New Cannondale Synapse vs SuperSix Evo vs SystemSix: Which is the best Cannondale road bike for you?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"78a520e3f6d48557ba387b74c8a97acde9515e39fc35aa9933f866735cc8fa65","category":"Cycling"}
