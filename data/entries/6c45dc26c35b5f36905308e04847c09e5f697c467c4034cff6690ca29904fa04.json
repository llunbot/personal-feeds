This suggests the first beta version of the update will be seeded to developers and public beta testers in the coming days.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/iOS-16.6-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple confirmed that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/09/apple-confirms-ios-16-5-release-date/\">iOS 16.5 will be released to the public this week</a>, so the first iOS 16.6 beta will likely be made available either later this week or next week. Apple has been internally testing iOS 16.6 since <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/13/apple-testing-ios-16-6/\">at least early April</a>, and it will likely be one of the final updates in the iOS 16 software cycle, as Apple is expected to announce iOS 17 at WWDC next month and shift its development efforts towards that update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 16.6 will likely be a smaller update given that iOS 17 is on the horizon, but it remains to be seen which new features, changes, and bug fixes will be included. Apple previously announced that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/07/new-imessage-apple-id-security-features/\">iMessage Contact Key Verification</a> would be available in 2023, but it is unclear exactly when the optional security setting will launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 16.6 should be released to the public in the weeks after WWDC, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/29/apple-announces-wwdc-2023/\">begins June 5</a>. There is no sign of Apple testing iOS 16.7 yet, but it's still early.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/\">iOS 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-16/\">iPadOS 16</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-16.238\">iOS 16</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/15/ios-16-6-beta-coming-soon/\">iOS 16.6 Beta Coming Soon for iPhones Ahead of iOS 17 at WWDC</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-16-6-beta-coming-soon-for-iphones-ahead-of-ios-17-at-wwdc.2389576/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6c45dc26c35b5f36905308e04847c09e5f697c467c4034cff6690ca29904fa04","category":"Apple"}
