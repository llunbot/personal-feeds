Today, together with ChargePoint, GM revealed that it will deploy \"hundreds\" of new DC fast chargers under the GM Energy brand in 2025.</p>\n<p>\"The transition to electric mobility continues to be driven by leaders such as General Motors offering innovative EVs and committing to make chargers as ubiquitous as possible,\" said Rick Wilmer, CEO of ChargePoint. \"Our collaboration with GM represents a significant investment in the infrastructure to enable fast and easy charging for all. Together, ChargePoint and GM will deliver a seamless fast charging experience via reliable charging hardware managed by our industry-leading software platform.\"</p>\n<p>Many (but not all) of the new chargers will be capable of delivering up to 500 kW, a higher power level than any EV currently on the market is able to charge. Many of the chargers will also feature ChargePoint's \"Omni Port,\" which has both CCS1 and NACS (J3400) plugs, allowing almost all EV drivers to make use of them.
