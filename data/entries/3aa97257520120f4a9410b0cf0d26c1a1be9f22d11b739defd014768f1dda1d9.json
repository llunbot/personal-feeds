Bike Ahead created an even lighter version with integrated internal cable routing channels. They call this new 1-piece carbon The Unit ICR bar+stem combo. <em>“The perfectly integrated cockpit solution”</em> for the high-end modern mountain bike. It’s even rated for enduro an eMTBs!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s now a surprising 10% lighter, while routing cables into the bar just 80mm before the center, so they can then smoothly curve inside the stem, down into the headset. Of course, since mountain bike brakes almost exclusively have external hoses, you’d want something like the latest <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-stealth-brake-levers-code-level-ultimate-silver/\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM Stealth</a> brake levers or another brake like the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/trickstuff-stealth-brakes-get-new-life-in-lower-cost-limited-edition-matte-black/\" target=\"_blank\">Trickstuff Piccola</a> that allows you to adjust the angle of the brake lines to tuck closely to the bar. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bike-Ahead-The-Unit-ICR-ultralight-1-piece-carbon-MTB-cockpit-mountain-bike-handlebar_integrated-routing-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1400\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bike-Ahead-The-Unit-ICR-ultralight-1-piece-carbon-MTB-cockpit-mountain-bike-handlebar_integrated-routing-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Bike Ahead The Unit ICR ultralight 1-piece carbon MTB cockpit mountain bike handlebar, internal cable routing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bike-Ahead-The-Unit-ICR-ultralight-1-piece-carbon-MTB-cockpit-mountain-bike-handlebar_integrated-routing-jpg.webp 1400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bike-Ahead-The-Unit-ICR-ultralight-1-piece-carbon-MTB-cockpit-mountain-bike-handlebar_integrated-routing-297x255.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bike-Ahead-The-Unit-ICR-ultralight-1-piece-carbon-MTB-cockpit-mountain-bike-handlebar_integrated-routing-120x103.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bike-Ahead-The-Unit-ICR-ultralight-1-piece-carbon-MTB-cockpit-mountain-bike-handlebar_integrated-routing-768x658.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But with more and more bikes featuring cable routing through their headset, this looks like one of the most tidy setups you can get when money is no object.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Picking the right MTB bar for you</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This new Bike Ahead bar is all about creating a sleek and lightweight mountain bike cockpit, shedding 16g off the previous version without internal routing. It’s super expensive, but claims to balance its light weight with ride-tuned stiffness.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebars-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebars-1-scaled.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebars-1-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebars-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebars-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebars-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebars-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebars-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebars-1-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebars-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Does your mountain bike bar need to be ultra-light or ultra-stiff? Earlier this year we took 42 different MTB bars out on the trail, then into the test lab to empirically see how material, clamp diameter &amp; rise affect how your mountain bike rides. If you haven’t checked that video out, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/does-handlebar-compliance-make-a-difference-faction-bike-studio-blind-test/\" target=\"_blank\">you really should</a>. I think the big takeaway was that stiffness wasn’t the only metric you want in an MTB bar. But even the most expensive bar in that test was less than 1/2 the price of this unit. Although we didn’t test any 1-piece bar+stem combos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we didn’t include any Bike Ahead bars in that test. And we’ve not laid hands on this new Unit, so let’s take a closer look at what sets it apart…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bike-Ahead-The-Unit-ICR-ultralight-1-piece-carbon-MTB-cockpit-mountain-bike-handlebar_underside-internal-cable-routing-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bike-Ahead-The-Unit-ICR-ultralight-1-piece-carbon-MTB-cockpit-mountain-bike-handlebar_underside-internal-cable-routing-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Bike Ahead The Unit ICR ultralight 1-piece carbon MTB cockpit mountain bike handlebar, underside cable ports\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bike-Ahead-The-Unit-ICR-ultralight-1-piece-carbon-MTB-cockpit-mountain-bike-handlebar_underside-internal-cable-routing-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bike-Ahead-The-Unit-ICR-ultralight-1-piece-carbon-MTB-cockpit-mountain-bike-handlebar_underside-internal-cable-routing-297x134.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bike-Ahead-The-Unit-ICR-ultralight-1-piece-carbon-MTB-cockpit-mountain-bike-handlebar_underside-internal-cable-routing-1536x691.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bike-Ahead-The-Unit-ICR-ultralight-1-piece-carbon-MTB-cockpit-mountain-bike-handlebar_underside-internal-cable-routing-120x54.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bike-Ahead-The-Unit-ICR-ultralight-1-piece-carbon-MTB-cockpit-mountain-bike-handlebar_underside-internal-cable-routing-768x346.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>handmade in Germany from UD carbon, with raw unpainted matte finish</li>\n\n\n\n<li>ultralight carbon layup optimized for “<em>good damping with the best possible torsional stiffness</em>“</li>\n\n\n\n<li>weight claims from 199g (44mm stem x 800mm wide) up to 210g (77x800mm)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>ICR internal cable routing compatible</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2 cables/hoses per side making it work with mechanical or electronic shifting, dropper posts &amp;
