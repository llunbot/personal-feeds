{"title":"Android Authority: ‘Google Is Transforming ChromeOS Into Android’","link":"https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-os-becoming-android-3500661/","date":1732040243000,"content":"\n<p>Mishaal Rahman, reporting for Android Authority:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While both Android and ChromeOS have seen huge success in\ndifferent markets, they’ve struggled to compete in one product\ncategory where they overlap: tablets. The high-end tablet market\nis dominated by the Apple iPad, and no matter what Google has\ntried, it has failed to change that. However, a source tells\nAndroid Authority that Google is working on a multi-year project\nto fully turn ChromeOS into Android, and the end result could be a\nplatform that finally bests the iPad.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Probably not. Frankly it’s kind of weird that Android is a peer to iOS when it comes to phones, but not at all when it comes to tablets, even though iPadOS remains just a big-screen version of iOS. There are zillions of tablets out there that run Android, but they’re all crap and everyone knows it. “Flagship Android phones” are a thing; “Flagship Android tablets” are not. And iPads are <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/10/apples-q424-results-95b-revenue-with-a-twist/\">a huge business for Apple</a>, and the iPad is now solidly established as a piece of our cultural firmament. Everyone knows what an iPad is.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To better compete with the iPad as well as manage engineering\nresources more effectively, Google wants to unify its operating\nsystem efforts. Instead of merging Android and Chrome OS into a\nnew operating system like rumors suggested in the past, however, a\nsource told me that Google is instead working on fully migrating\nChromeOS over to Android. While we don’t know what this means for\nthe ChromeOS or Chromebook brands, we did hear that Google wants\nfuture “Chromebooks” to ship with the Android OS in the future.\nThat’s why I believe that <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-laptop-android-3500619/\">Google’s rumored new Pixel Laptop</a>\nwill run a new version of desktop Android as opposed to the\nChromeOS that you’re likely familiar with.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So they’re not “merging” the two OSes as rumored, many times, in the past, but they’re “fully migrating ChromeOS over to Android”. The only way that really makes a lick of sense is that they’re shitcanning ChromeOS and working to make Android not suck on devices other than phones, like laptops and tablets. Good luck with that, given that even Apple has struggled to make iOS/iPadOS a good laptop OS. OS platforms are just hard — hard to design, hard to engineer, hard to evolve. And Apple, for one, seems more committed than ever to the idea that MacOS and iPadOS remain very different platforms.</p>\n\n<p>And, somehow, there’s no mention of <a href=\"https://fuchsia.dev/\">Fuchsia</a> in Rahman’s piece. Fuchsia is supposedly Google’s OS of the future, but which more and more is smelling like Google’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/190363/time_machine_copland.html\">Copland</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taligent\">Pink</a> — a sprawling “next-gen” OS project that collapses under the weight of its own ambition and lack of practical focus, spinning its wheels for years “in development” whilst the world moves on.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/19/chromeos-android-merge-maybe\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ec03743d6d77fec6235445cb1386471fe7731e86669bf59d0bb5fcfab53f9f59","category":"Tech"}
