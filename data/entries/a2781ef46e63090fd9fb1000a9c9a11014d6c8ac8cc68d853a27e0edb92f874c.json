It's $4.99 instead of $9.99, and is designed around <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith the Voice Plan, users can access and play songs, playlists, and albums on their Apple devices solely through ‌Siri‌ requests. The plan does not offer the standard ‌Apple Music‌ user interface, instead offering a customized in-app experience with suggestions based on music preferences.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThough ‌Apple Music‌ Voice Plan is limited to voice-based song playback, it provides access to all ‌Apple Music‌ songs, playlists, and stations. A Just Ask ‌Siri‌ feature suggests music based on listening history and likes or dislikes, and Play it Again allows users to access a list of their recently played music.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\niOS 15.2 is likely to see an official release next week, and it is available to developers and public beta testers at this time.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/07/ios-15-2-apple-music-voice-plan/\">Apple Music Voice Plan Coming in iOS 15.2</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-voice-plan-coming-in-ios-15-2.2326581/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9T76DJuV89I:_HUc1OVltws:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9T76DJuV89I:_HUc1OVltws:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a2781ef46e63090fd9fb1000a9c9a11014d6c8ac8cc68d853a27e0edb92f874c","category":"Apple"}
