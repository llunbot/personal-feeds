{"title":"24 Years After ‘Sorry, Steve: Here’s Why the Apple Stores Won’t Work’","link":"https://ritholtz.com/2025/05/sorry-steve/","date":1747947894000,"content":"\n<p>Barry Ritholtz, in an excerpt from his brand-new book, <em><a href=\"https://www.hownottoinvestbook.com/\">How Not to Invest</a></em>, marking the occasion of the 24th anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2001-05-20/commentary-sorry-steve-heres-why-apple-stores-wont-work\">Cliff Edwards’s claim chowder hall of famer</a>, predicting doom for Apple’s then-new foray into its own chain of retail stores:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are many genuinely revolutionary products and services that,\nwhen they come along, change everything. Pick your favorite: the\niPod and iPhone, Tesla Model S, Netflix streaming, Amazon Prime,\nAI, perhaps even Bitcoin. Radical products break the mold; their\ndifference and unfamiliarity challenge us. We (mostly) cannot\nforetell the impact of true innovation. Then, once it’s a wild\nsuccess, we have a hard time recalling how life was before that\nproduct existed.</p>\n\n<p>The Apple Store was clearly one of those game-changers: By 2020,\nApple had opened over 500 stores in 25 countries. They are among\nthe top-tier retailers and the fastest to reach a billion dollars\nin annual sales. They achieved the highest sales per square foot\nin 2012 among all retailers. By 2017, they were generating $5,546\nper square foot in revenues, twice the dollar amount of Tiffany’s,\ntheir closest competitor. Apple no longer breaks out the specifics\nof its stores in its quarterly reports, but estimates of store\nrevenue are about $2.4 billion per month.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>May 2001 is so long ago, Daring Fireball hadn’t yet launched. So I can’t say I predicted the success of Apple’s retail stores. But what I recall thinking, at the time, was that it <em>might</em> work, and was definitely worth trying. Here’s the nut of Edwards’s 2001 piece:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since PC retailing gross margins are normally 10% or less, Apple\nwould have to sell $12 million a year per store to pay for the\nspace. Gateway does about $8 million annually at each of its\nCountry Stores. Then there’s the cost of construction, hiring\nexperienced staff. “I give them two years before they’re turning\nout the lights on a very painful and expensive mistake,” says\nGoldstein. [...]</p>\n\n<p>What’s more, Apple’s retail thrust could be one step forward, two\nsteps back in terms of getting Macs in front of customers. Since\nmost Mac fans already know where to buy, much of the sales from\nApple’s stores could come out of the hides of existing Mac\ndealers. That would bring its already damaged relations with\npartners to new lows. In early 1999, Best Buy Co. dropped\nthe iMac line after refusing a Jobs edict that it stock all eight\ncolors. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. late last year dumped Apple,\nsources say, after concluding that sales were too hit or miss.\nAnd in recent weeks, Mac-only chains such as The Computer Store\nand ComputerWare have closed down, citing weak margins. Now,\nfaced with competition from Apple, others may cut back. “When you\nchoose to compete with your retailers, clearly that’s not a\ncomfortable situation,” says CompUSA Chief Operating Officer\nLawrence N. Mondry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Two decades later, talking about the importance of Sears as a retail partner looks pretty dumb. But to me, the obvious problem with this argument in 2001 is that if Apple’s existing retail partners in 2001 were doing an even vaguely good job, why was the Mac’s market share so low? At the time they were only a handful of years past the crisis where the company almost went bankrupt. Apple, in the old days, had some fantastic small mom-and-pop official retailers, but they were <em>small</em>. And the big partners, like CompUSA, absolutely sucked at showcasing the Mac. Their demo machines were frequently broken.</p>\n\n<p>If you understood and believed that the Mac was a superior product, it was easy to conclude that its relatively low market share must have been a function of problems with its marketing and retail strategy. Gateway’s fundamental problem had nothing to do with the fact that it was running its own retail stores — it was that they were selling shitty computers. Apple was selling great computers, but had shitty retail partners.</p>\n\n<p>(I’m a longtime fan of Ritholtz’s writing; I’ve got a copy of \n<em><a href=\"https://www.hownottoinvestbook.com/\">How Not to Invest</a></em> — <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/56320/9781804091197\">here’s a make-me-rich Bookshop.org link</a> — and it’s next on my reading list after I finish Patrick McGee’s <em><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/56320/9781668053379\">Apple in China</a></em>.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/22/ritholtz-sorry-steve\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4300f5266df5bf6a571d9aa6b49c02cc4a34a085195e26b5ae7f693bf3e7e1b3","category":"Tech"}
