However, health officials are not telling unvaccinated students who were potentially exposed to quarantine.</p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/02/measles-erupts-in-florida-school-where-11-of-kids-are-unvaccinated/\">The school has a low vaccination rate</a>, suggesting that the extremely contagious virus could spark a yet larger outbreak. But in <a href=\"https://wsvn.com/news/local/broward/students-return-to-manatee-bay-elementary-following-6-confirmed-cases-of-measles/\">a letter sent to parents late Tuesday</a>, Florida Surgeon General <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/florida-surgeon-general-wrong-on-vaccines-and-bad-at-his-job-cdc-and-fda-say/\">Joseph Ladapo</a>—known for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/floridas-new-surgeon-general-skeptical-of-vaccines-opposes-masks/\">spreading anti-vaccine rhetoric</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/02/floridas-polarizing-surgeon-general-accused-of-manipulating-covid-data/\">vaccine misinformation</a>—indicated that unvaccinated students can skip the normally recommended quarantine period.</p>\n<p>The letter, signed by Ladapo, noted that people with measles can be contagious from four days before the rash develops through four days after the rash appears. And while symptoms often develop between eight to 14 days after exposure, the disease can take 21 days to appear. As such, the normal quarantine period for exposed and unvaccinated people, who are highly susceptible to measles, is 21 days.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005122#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005122&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d82ed865bc5f2ab2cb5f420b9fcd87055b35c240c7e8ddd51689f34ef206211f","category":"Tech"}
