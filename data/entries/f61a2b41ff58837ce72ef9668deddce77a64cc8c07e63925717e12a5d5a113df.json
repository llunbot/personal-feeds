Comfort, control, even durability benefits come along for the cold ride. Let me explain.</p>\n<p>First, actually, let me concede a point. It's true that BEVs lose range in colder climates. The two main reasons for that stem from the need to keep both the cabin and battery pack warm, which requires energy that would otherwise go toward moving. And, generally speaking, it takes more energy to warm an electric vehicle in the winter than to cool it in the summer.</p>\n<p>But bear in mind, <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/fuel-economy-cold-weather#:~:text=Cold%20weather%20and%20winter%20driving,be%20at%2077%C2%B0F.\">all cars lose range in the winter</a>. Air gets denser as it cools, which takes more work to push through. And all the viscous fluids vehicles need take more time to warm up to their respective operating temperatures. And that means your engine, transmission, and differential all have more work to do—requiring more energy—in the cold.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1988567#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1988567&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f61a2b41ff58837ce72ef9668deddce77a64cc8c07e63925717e12a5d5a113df","category":"Tech"}
