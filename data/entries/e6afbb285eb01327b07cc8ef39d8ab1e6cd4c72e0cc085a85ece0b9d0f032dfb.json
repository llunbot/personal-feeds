Now Hahn is bringing the character back for her own standalone adventure with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_All_Along_(miniseries)\"><em>Agatha All Along.</em></a> Based on the first trailer, it looks like a lot of dark, spooky fun, just in time for the Halloween season. The nine-episode series is one of the TV series in the MCU's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe:_Phase_Five\">Phase Five</a>, coming on the heels of <em>Secret Invasion, Loki </em>S2, <em>What If...?</em> S2, and <em>Echo</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WandaVision\"><em>WandaVision</em></a> below.)</strong></p>\n<p><em>WandaVision</em> was set immediately after the events of <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> (but before <em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em>), with newlyweds Wanda and Vision starting their married life in the town of Westview, New Jersey. Wacky hijinks ensued as the couple tried to lead a normal life while hiding their superpowers from their neighbors—especially Hahn's nosy Agnes. Each episode was shot in the style of a particular era of sitcom television, from the 1950s through the 2000s. The couple noticed more and more jarring elements—a full-color drone, a voice calling out to Wanda over the radio, neighbors briefly breaking character—hinting that this seemingly idyllic suburban existence might not be what it seemed.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035566#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035566&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e6afbb285eb01327b07cc8ef39d8ab1e6cd4c72e0cc085a85ece0b9d0f032dfb","category":"Tech"}
