{"title":"Warren Buffett’s 2024 Report to Berkshire Hathaway Shareholders","link":"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2024ltr.pdf","date":1744490928000,"content":"\n<p>Warren Buffett’s annual shareholders letters are always a must-read. The honesty, clarity, and striking humility of his prose stands out in a world where corporate communications — from companies of any size — tend to be bland and obfuscating. <a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2024ltr.pdf\">This year’s letter</a>, published back in February, is no exception. Two sections stood out to me. First, in a section titled “Mistakes — Yes, We Make Them at Berkshire”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sometimes I’ve made mistakes in assessing the future economics of\na business I’ve purchased for Berkshire — each a case of capital\nallocation gone wrong. That happens with both judgments about\nmarketable equities — we view these as <em>partial</em> ownership of\nbusinesses — and the 100% acquisitions of companies.</p>\n\n<p>At other times, I’ve made mistakes when assessing the abilities or\nfidelity of the managers Berkshire is hiring. The fidelity\ndisappointments can hurt beyond their financial impact, a pain\nthat can approach that of a failed marriage.</p>\n\n<p>A decent batting average in personnel decisions is all that can be\nhoped for. The cardinal sin is delaying the correction of mistakes\nor what Charlie Munger called “thumb-sucking.” Problems, he would\ntell me, cannot be wished away. They require action, however\nuncomfortable that may be.</p>\n\n<p>During the 2019-23 period, I have used the words “mistake” or\n“error” 16 times in my letters to you. Many other huge companies\nhave <em>never</em> used either word over that span. Amazon, I should\nacknowledge, made some brutally candid observations in its 2021\nletter. Elsewhere, it has generally been happy talk and pictures.</p>\n\n<p>I have also been a director of large public companies at which\n“mistake” or “wrong” were forbidden words at board meetings or\nanalyst calls. That taboo, implying managerial perfection, always\nmade me nervous (though, at times, there could be legal issues\nthat make limited discussion advisable. We live in a very\nlitigious society.)</p>\n\n<p>At 94, it won’t be long before Greg Abel replaces me as CEO and\nwill be writing the annual letters. Greg shares the Berkshire\ncreed that a “report” is what a Berkshire CEO annually owes to\nowners. And he also understands that if you start fooling your\nshareholders, you will soon believe your own baloney and be\nfooling yourself as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As the great physicist Richard Feynman said, “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.”</p>\n\n<p>Second is an entire section, not complaining, but instead proudly declaring, that last year Berkshire set the record for the highest single-year corporate income tax payment in United States history:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Huge numbers can be hard to visualize. Let me recast the $26.8\nbillion that we paid last year.</p>\n\n<p>If Berkshire had sent the Treasury a $1 million check every 20\nminutes throughout all of 2024 — visualize <em>366 days and nights</em>\nbecause 2024 was a leap year — we still would have owed the\nfederal government a significant sum at yearend. Indeed, it would\nbe well into January before the Treasury would tell us that we\ncould take a short breather, get some sleep, and prepare for our\n2025 tax payments. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Berkshire’s activities now impact all corners of our country. And\nwe are not finished. Companies die for many reasons but, unlike\nthe fate of humans, old age itself is not lethal. Berkshire today\nis far more youthful than it was in 1965.</p>\n\n<p><em>However</em>, as Charlie and I have always acknowledged, Berkshire\nwould not have achieved its results in any locale except America\nwhereas America would have been every bit the success it has been\nif Berkshire had never existed.</p>\n\n<p>So thank you, Uncle Sam. Someday your nieces and nephews at\nBerkshire hope to send you even larger payments than we did in\n2024. Spend it wisely. Take care of the many who, for no fault of\ntheir own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better. And\nnever forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and\nthat result <em>requires</em> both wisdom and vigilance on your part.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, that was written back in February. Prescient as always.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/12/buffet-2024-berkshire-shareholders-letter\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8118092184e6e177b59a9cac5adb5ff5ad0dd235973efb708d54c89179be502e","category":"Tech"}
