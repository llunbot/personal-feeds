{"title":"OpenAI Shows Records and Plays Recordings for Washington Post Showing They Really Did Hire an Unnamed Actress to Voice ‘Sky’","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/05/22/openai-scarlett-johansson-chatgpt-ai-voice/","date":1716516374000,"content":"\n<p>Nitasha Tiku, reporting for The Washington Post:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But while many hear an eerie resemblance between “Sky” and\nJohansson’s “Her” character, an actress was hired in June to\ncreate the Sky voice, months before Altman contacted Johansson,\naccording to documents, recordings, casting directors and the\nactress’s agent.</p>\n\n<p>The agent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the\nsafety of her client, said the actress confirmed that neither\nJohansson nor the movie “Her” were ever mentioned by OpenAI. The\nactress’s natural voice sounds identical to the AI-generated Sky\nvoice, based on brief recordings of her initial voice test\nreviewed by The Post. The agent said the name Sky was chosen to\nsignal a cool, airy and pleasant sound.</p>\n\n<p>Joanne Jang, who leads AI model behavior for OpenAI, said that the\ncompany selected actors who were eager to work on an AI product.\n[...] Jang said she “kept a tight tent” around the AI voices\nproject, making Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati the sole\ndecision-maker to preserve the artistic choices of the director\nand the casting office. Altman was on his world tour during much\nof the casting process and not intimately involved, she said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seemingly clears OpenAI of any suspicion that they were lying about having hired an unnamed actress to provide Sky’s voice, and had actually trained it on recordings of Johansson. I will admit I had my suspicions. (It also speaks to the importance of trusted institutions like the Post.)</p>\n\n<p>But as Tiku elaborates, hiring an unnamed actress to provide the voice doesn’t necessarily get OpenAI out of jeopardy:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He compared Johansson’s case to one brought by the singer Bette\nMidler against the Ford Motor Co. in the 1980s. Ford asked Midler\nto use her voice in ads. After she declined, Ford hired an\nimpersonator. A U.S. appellate court ruled in Midler’s favor,\nindicating her voice was protected against unauthorized use. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Several factors go against OpenAI, he said, namely Altman’s tweet\nand his outreach to Johansson in September and May. “It just begs\nthe question: It’s like, if you use a different person, there was\nno intent for it to sound like Scarlett Johansson. Why are you\nreaching out to her two days before?” he said. “That would have to\nbe explained.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-05-09-me-238-story.html\">Tom Waits won a similar lawsuit against Frito-Lay</a> in 1990, based on the Midler precedent.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/23/openai-wapo-voice\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"996e6aeaae9c841d642754c3b5fb084010b9a0d6255ee145d7d06674dd205ac7","category":"Tech"}
