{"title":"Zuckerberg Talks About Apple With Joe Rogan: ‘They Haven’t Invented Anything Great in a While’","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/10/mark-zuckerberg-joe-rogan-apple-innovation/","date":1736554305000,"content":"\n<p>Chance Miller listened so we don’t have to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Zuckerberg also took issue with AirPods and the fact that Apple\nwouldn’t give Meta the same access to the iPhone for its Meta\nRay-Ban glasses:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>They build stuff like AirPods, which are cool, but they’ve just\nthoroughly hamstrung the ability for anyone else to build\nsomething that can connect to the iPhone in the same way.</p>\n\n<p>There were a lot of other companies in the world that would be\nable to build like a very good earbud, but Apple has a specific\nprotocol that they’ve built into the iPhone that allows AirPods to\nbasically connect to it.</p>\n\n<p>It’s just much more seamless because they’ve enabled that, but\nthey don’t let anyone else use the protocol. If they did, there\nwould probably be much better competitors to AirPods out there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If only there existed other phone platforms than the iPhone, we could see how cool these other earbuds would be. And Meta Ray-Bans could integrate with those phones in super cool ways that would make iPhone users realize what dopes they’ve been.</p>\n\n<p>What’s really rich about Meta and Zuckerberg’s incessant complaining about being restricted by Apple’s rules for third party software on Apple’s platforms is that Meta doesn’t allow third parties any sort of access to their successful platforms. There are no third-party clients for Facebook, Instagram, Threads, or WhatsApp. It is very hard to get any information out of them let alone integrate with them bi-directionally.</p>\n\n<p>Miller concludes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Let us also not forget that Meta has never “invented anything\ngreat.” Oculus was an acquisition, WhatsApp was an acquisition,\nInstagram was an acquisition, and intermixed with those\nacquisitions are features copied and pasted from other platforms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yeah but other than that they invented a lot.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/10/zuckerberg-rogan\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c694ade1897c7fa8640031604d9dff1fa264083e162fa118118e1952f427d30b","category":"Tech"}
