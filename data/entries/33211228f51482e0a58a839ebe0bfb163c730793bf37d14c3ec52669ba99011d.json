Their standout feature is right there in the name. “H-Core” refers to the two inserts that run the circumference of the rims. They’re made of a different carbon than the rim itself and are already pre-cured when they’re laid into the mold when the rims are being manufactured. They offer extra support between the bead walls and the rest of the rim below. Hunt says the inserts’ shape helps improve carbon compaction, which means a less porous, stronger structure without the need for excess material in the rim chassis itself.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/HUNT-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H_Core-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/HUNT-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H_Core-2.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/HUNT-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H_Core-2.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/HUNT-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H_Core-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/HUNT-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H_Core-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/HUNT-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H_Core-5.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/HUNT-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H_Core-5.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/HUNT-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H_Core-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>As with some of Hunt’s other wheelsets, the Proven Carbon Trail H-Core has unique front- and rear-specific rim construction and spokes. Both front and rear are 28-hole two-cross, but the rear uses 2.0/1.7/2.0 butted spokes, while the front uses 2.0/1.6/2.0. One of the goals is to give the front wheel a bit more lateral flex to limit deflection and improve traction. The front wheel has a more compliant build and a slightly wider inner width. The rear wheel gets slightly wider bead walls for better impact resistance, and is built to offer more lateral stiffness. All this is balanced against vertical compliance and, of course, strength and weight.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Strength-to-Weight-Ratio.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Strength-to-Weight-Ratio.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Strength-to-Weight-Ratio.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Strength-to-Weight-Ratio.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Proven-Trail-Failure-v-Stiffness.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Proven-Trail-Failure-v-Stiffness.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Proven-Trail-Failure-v-Stiffness.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Proven-Trail-Failure-v-Stiffness.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Hunt compared the Carbon Trail H-Core to other carbon wheels in their category (trail / all-mountain “designed for bikes up to 160 mm in fork travel”). At a claimed 1,732 grams for a 29″ pair, that’s about on par with the 1,750-gram Santa Cruz Reserve 30SL. But HUNT found the Trail H-Core wheels to withstand impacts better than Reserve and nearly as well as some of the best-regarded wheels you can buy. Except, you can buy the Trail H-Core wheels for significantly less. They go for $1,500. That’s $480 cheaper than the DT Swiss wheels that HUNT tested them against and $800 less than the ENVEs. That price includes HUNT’s far-reaching H-Care (not to be confused with H-Core) crash replacement service, which covers both parts and labor for replacing parts damaged while riding.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/HUNT-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H_Core-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/HUNT-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H_Core-10.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/HUNT-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H_Core-10.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/HUNT-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H_Core-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/HUNT-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H_Core-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/HUNT-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H_Core-9.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/HUNT-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H_Core-9.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/HUNT-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H_Core-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Carbon Trail H-Core wheels are built around HUNT’s new two-degree RapidEngage hub, which runs on two sets of three alternating two-tooth pawls. The hubs are currently Centerlock-only and Boost-only, with either HG, XD, or Micro-Spline freehub bodies. The wheelsets are available in either matching 29” or 27.5” rear and 29” front.</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://us.huntbikewheels.com/collections/proven-carbon-mtb-wheels\" target=\"_blank\">Hunt</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/hunt-wheels-trail-h-core-wheelset/\">Hunt Introduces Proven Carbon Trail H-Core Wheelset: Carbon-Reinforced Carbon</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Travis Engel","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"33211228f51482e0a58a839ebe0bfb163c730793bf37d14c3ec52669ba99011d","category":"Cycling"}
