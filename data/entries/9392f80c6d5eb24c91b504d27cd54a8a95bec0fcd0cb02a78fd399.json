The biggest threat to a liftoff today, almost certainly, is some issue during the countdown with the vehicle or ground systems, as commonly occurs with new rockets.</p>\n<p>If the rocket does lift off, then nominally, the Terran 1 will reach a 365 km by 373 km orbit at precisely eight minutes. But it's very far from clear that the launch of the Terran 1 rocket, the majority of which was additively manufactured by large 3D printers, will go as planned. In recognition that this is purely a test flight, Relativity has put no customer payloads on the flight. And the mission has a lighthearted name, \"Good Luck, Have Fun,\" that acknowledges there is a bit of a hold-my-beer aspect to this test flight.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922510#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922510&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"23e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9392f80c6d5eb24c91b504d27cd54a8a95bec0fcd0cb02a78fd399","category":"Tech"}
