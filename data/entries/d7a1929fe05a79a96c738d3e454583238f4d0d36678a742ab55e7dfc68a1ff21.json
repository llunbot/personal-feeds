{"title":"Review: Mickey 17’s dark comedic antics make for a wild cinematic ride","link":"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/review-mickey-17s-dark-comedic-antics-make-for-a-wild-cinematic-ride/","date":1741380247000,"content":"<p>Oscar-winning director <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/02/fish-monsters-barking-dogs-and-roach-patties-the-films-of-bong-joon-ho/\">Bong Joon-Ho</a> returns to the big screen this weekend with the sci-fi film <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_17\"><em>Mickey 17</em></a>. If you're expecting the subtly devastating social commentary of his 2019 drama/horror/thriller-hybrid <em>Parasite</em>, I suspect you'll be disappointed. <em>Mickey 17</em> is a very different beast in both aesthetic and tone. When the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA1s65o_kYM\">first trailer</a> dropped, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/09/robert-pattinson-dies-again-and-again-in-trailer-for-bong-joon-hos-mickey-17/\">I wrote</a> that the film felt like a darkly comedic version of Duncan Jones' 2009 film <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_(2009_film)\"><em>Moon</em></a>, with a dash of the surreal absurdity of Terry Gilliam's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_(1985_film)\"><em>Brazil</em></a> (1985) thrown in for good measure. I stand by that assessment, and it proves to be a winning combination.</p>\n<p><strong>(Some spoilers below but no major reveals.)</strong></p>\n<p>The film is based on the 2022 novel <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey7\"><em>Mickey7</em></a> by Edward Ashton. Ashton's inspiration for the novel was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletransportation_paradox\">teletransportation paradox</a>—a thought experiment pondering the philosophy of identity that challenges certain notions of the self and consciousness. It started as a short story about what Ashton called \"a crappy immortality\" and expanded from there into a full-length novel. (Ashton also penned a sequel, <em>Antimatter Blues</em>, which was published in 2023.)</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/review-mickey-17s-dark-comedic-antics-make-for-a-wild-cinematic-ride/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/review-mickey-17s-dark-comedic-antics-make-for-a-wild-cinematic-ride/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d7a1929fe05a79a96c738d3e454583238f4d0d36678a742ab55e7dfc68a1ff21","category":"Tech"}
