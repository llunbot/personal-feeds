The lira dropped 15 percent after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan staunchly defended recent rate cuts, reports <em><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkish-lira-drifts-off-record-low-erdogan-defends-policy-rate-2021-11-23/\">Reuters</a></em>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/turkey-apple-store.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nRight now, Apple's <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/tr/store\">Turkey storefront</a> is up and operational, but no devices are able to be added to a virtual cart or purchased at this time because of the volatility.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA Turkish lira is equivalent to approximately 0.078 U.S. dollars at the current time, and its value has been steadily falling since last week. Over the course of the last year, the Lira has dropped 45 percent vs. the dollar.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere is no word on when Apple might resume sales in Turkey, but inflation is close to 20 percent and with Erdogan continuing to refuse to raise interest rates, the downward slide may continue.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(Thanks, Can!)</em><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/turkey/\">Turkey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/23/apple-store-turkey-sales-halted/\">Apple Temporarily Halts Sales in Turkey After Currency Crash</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-temporarily-halts-sales-in-turkey-after-currency-crash.2324637/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=CbqJ0cRZ2UM:jrcU0Hq2kug:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=CbqJ0cRZ2UM:jrcU0Hq2kug:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b4c6bb58791cddc5b32d70b8793116cdb630128da1003de732d59496c952d177","category":"Apple"}
