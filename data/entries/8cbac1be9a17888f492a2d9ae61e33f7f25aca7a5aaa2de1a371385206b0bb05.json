The Scott team has been working on tightening up the Addict RC for quite a while <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/scott-addict-rc-road-bike-is-all-new-for-2020-more-integrated-aero-much-more/\">(five years to be exact)</a>. They looked to make it leaner without removing its climbing and sprinting power. It seems the work has paid off, with the newest frameset iteration coming in 300g lighter when compared to its predecessor. It’s not all about weight, though; the Scott Addict RC brings extra spice with an updated geometry, and new Syncros one piece cockpit and a more compliant seatpost design. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-top-tube-logo-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-top-tube-logo-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC 10 top tube logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-top-tube-logo-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-top-tube-logo-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-top-tube-logo-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-top-tube-logo-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-top-tube-logo-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-top-tube-logo-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-top-tube-logo-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(All Photos: Jordan Villella/BikeRumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s New? Scott Addict RC </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated Scott Addict RC is a super lightweight (under 5.9kg for some models) race bike with a special love for the mountains. As mentioned above, the new frame sheds 300g from the previous version but keeps the liveliness of the ride. For a full breakdown, check out<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/all-new-addict-rc-is-scotts-lightest-road-bike-ever-from-under-5-9kg/\"> our new piece here.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC 10 syncros seatpost\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>How? </strong></em>This involves reducing ‘dead-end tube segments’ during the carbon molding process or creating a more fluid and efficient molding process. The engineering team at Scott says this process is unique in the cycling industry, and it’s only applicable if the frame design is tailor-made for this manufacturing method.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-head-on--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-head-on--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC 10 syncros bars head on\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-head-on--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-head-on--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-head-on--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-head-on--120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-head-on--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-head-on--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-head-on--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated molding process utilizes an inflatable perform core that keeps the inside of the frame clean and doesn’t show voids or wrinkles in the carbon. Scott says, <em>“Due to the precise inside shape, all the excessive resin is extracted from the frame during molding, leaving only what’s necessary for stiffness and strength.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, consistent molding pressure across the complete frame surface gives a super compact layup, making any additional reinforcement unnecessary while reducing the thickness to about 0.6mm in some areas. You can learn more about Scott’s unique carbon process and how they trimmed the excess weight in the video below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div><figcaption>A deep dive into the process of creating the Addict RC </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott’s manufacturing process (PP Mandrel) enables the molding of high-precision inner surfaces and transition zones. When paired with strength-optimized tube shapes that eliminate additional reinforcements and unnecessary filler material, the result is a super lightweight, responsive bike frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-back-side--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-back-side--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC 10 back side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-back-side--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-back-side--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-back-side--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-back-side--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-back-side--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-back-side--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Scott Addict RC Geo </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with shedding some weight, the new Addict RC’s geometry has been redesigned. Don’t worry—it’s not a complete overhaul, but Scott moved towards dynamic sizing. This helps carry the Addict RCs’ <em>“true ride feel”</em> throughout the size spectrum. For example, the medium (54cm) now has a headtube angle of 72.8° compared to the previous model’s 72.5° the same size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Addict RC comes in a staggering seven sizes, starting with XXS/47cm and maxing out at XXL/61cm. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-geo-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1466\" height=\"748\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-geo-top.png\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC geo top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-geo-top.png 1466w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-geo-top-297x152.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-geo-top-120x61.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-geo-top-768x392.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-geometery-.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1452\" height=\"810\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-geometery-.png\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC geometery\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-geometery-.png 1452w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-geometery--297x166.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-geometery--120x67.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-geometery--768x428.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott’s vision for the new Addict RC is that of a modern rider that embraces wider tires but still wants a performance machine. The update is what we’ve seen from most brands this season. They want to make the race bikes lightly more palatable for various riders without affecting the handling or stability of descending.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-tail-light--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-tail-light--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC 10 tail light\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-tail-light--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-tail-light--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-tail-light--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-tail-light--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-tail-light--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-tail-light--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-tail-light--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Comfort Tuned </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott has doubled down on comfort for the new Addict. It comes stock with 30mm tires, but the frame has enough clearance for 34mm tires, ensuring a smooth and comfortable ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-detached--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-detached--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC 10 detached\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-detached--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-detached--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-detached--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-detached--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-detached--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-detached--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-detached--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Redesigned Seatpost and Clamp</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another re-do for many companies this season is the seatpost clamp design, and Scott is on pace. The new seatpost clamp supports the Addicts’ overall mission of comfort and a lightweight chassis. The updated clamp allows for thinner seat tube walls and reduced material, saving weight and permitting some seatpost flexion. The clamp also keeps the post in place securely without needing a hefty torque. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost-cover--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost-cover--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC 10 syncros seatpost cover\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost-cover--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost-cover--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost-cover--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost-cover--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost-cover--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost-cover--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost-cover--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>SP-R100-SL Seatpost</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Scott Addict arrives with two different seatpost options, depending on your ride needs and weight demands. The new SL seat post is 10% lighter than the previous model, and the Comfort Seapost offers 30% more flexion than the SL. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>How?</em></strong> The new carbon fiber-friendly seat post clamp design and an optimized seat post layup. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC 10 syncros seatpost\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-seatpost--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Comfort seatpost also hides a magnetic bracket system to swap the cover with the new SYNCROS rear light. It’s an excellent addition and melts into the seaport design, never affecting the bike’s silhouette. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bar-end-tool-stem--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bar-end-tool-stem--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC 10 syncros bar end tool stem\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bar-end-tool-stem--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bar-end-tool-stem--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bar-end-tool-stem--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bar-end-tool-stem--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bar-end-tool-stem--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bar-end-tool-stem--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bar-end-tool-stem--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>IC-R100-SL Integrated Cockpit </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The introduction of the new Addict RC set the stage for developing the Syncros cockpit, the IC-R100-SL. The Scott team’s design goal was to create an aerodynamic handlebar that ticked the comfort and stiffness boxes. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-side--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-side--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC 10 syncros bars side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-side--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-side--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-side--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-side--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-side--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-side--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-side--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like the updated Syncros seatpost, the new Syncros IC-R100-SL shaves down the material with a super cool clamp design and an FEA-optimized carbon layup.

But our time (one ride) has been memorable, and I’m stoked for more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the ride details, I would like to comment on the assembly and dial-in of our review rig. The T25 is the only fitting needed for adjustments (except the shifter body and axles). <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fourth-gen-canyon-aeroad-is-faster/\">Canyon did the same thing</a>, and I found it fantastic. Unlike Canyon, the Scott Addict RC hides its T25 in the bar end of the new IC-R100-SL rather than the axle, which keeps the bike clean-looking. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-saddle--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-saddle--1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC 10 syncros saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-saddle--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-saddle--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-saddle--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-saddle--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-saddle--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-saddle--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-lever--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-lever--1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC 10 syncros bars lever\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-lever--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-lever--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-lever--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-lever--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-lever--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-bars-lever--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The touch points on the bike are comfortable. Though the Syncros Belcarra saddle is too narrow for my liking, but it’s not unrideable. My favorite new addition to the Scott Addict RC is the Syncros IC-R100-SL cockpit. It has a unique shape and reminds me slightly of the Syncros MTB bar with a dramatic bend near the stem.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-Syncros-bars--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-Syncros-bars--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC 10 Syncros bars\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-Syncros-bars--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-Syncros-bars--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-Syncros-bars--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-Syncros-bars--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-Syncros-bars--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-Syncros-bars--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The shape of the bars (I opted for a 40cm/110mm) is slightly progressive without getting overly narrow or aero with the hoods.

There is no mistake, however. This bike wants to move, especially when the road points uphill. Our Addict RC 10 with Shimano Dura-Ace comes in at 15 lbs stock with no cages or pedals. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-derail--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-derail--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC 10 derail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-derail--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-derail--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-derail--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-derail--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-derail--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-derail--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The geometry is a nice mix of sitting comfortably on the climb and churning out a solid pace. When the descent starts, the Addict RC comes alive. Its steering is sharper than expected, especially with the current 30mm tire setup.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-Capital-1.0s-wheelset--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-Capital-1.0s-wheelset--1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC 10 syncros Capital 1.0s wheelset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-Capital-1.0s-wheelset--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-Capital-1.0s-wheelset--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-Capital-1.0s-wheelset--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-Capital-1.0s-wheelset--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-Capital-1.0s-wheelset--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-syncros-Capital-1.0s-wheelset--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-wheels--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-wheels--1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC 10 top tube logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-wheels--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-wheels--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-wheels--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-wheels--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-wheels--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Syncros wheels perfectly match the Addict RC’s climbing prowess. The Capital 1.0s wheels have a modern 25mm internal width, and a hookless bead. The 40mm depth is a nice mix of aero and climb-worthy light. The rims are laced to DT-240 hubs are an excellent match in weight and longevity. The same applies to the extra Dura Ace 34T climbing gear speed spec’d on the Addict RC 10. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Comfort and Power </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The feel and sensation of the Addict RC on the road are a bit old school, as in not overly stiff. Seeing rounder, fluid designs rather than boxy, brutalist shapes is a nice change of pace, especially on the progressive road front. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-logo--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-logo--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC 10 logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-logo--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-logo--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-logo--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-logo--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-logo--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-logo--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-logo--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On rougher road sections, the Addict RC is more than capable. The thin and boxy seat stays round out enough chatter, and what they miss, the 30mm Schwalbe Pro One tires will. Considering the thin walled, lightweight tubes, the Addict RC has a tranquil and resonance-free ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-full-bike--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-full-bike--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC 10 full bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-full-bike--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-full-bike--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-full-bike--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-full-bike--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-full-bike--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-full-bike--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-10-full-bike--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike’s silhouette is beautiful, especially when the glossy white with slight sparkle meets the matte black carbon. Subtle touches in the designs and logo keep the Addict RC classy but still you know its a Scott. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look for a full review soon as we tick off more miles on the Scott Addict RC. As for our first ride impressions, this bike flies uphill, can handle some rough roads, and will surely catch some retro eyes parked outside the cafe stop. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scott-sports.com/addict-rc\">Check out the full range at: Scott.com</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/scott-addict-rc/\">First Look: Scott’s Addict RC Pro Was Worth the Five-Year Wait</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"8cbac1be9a17888f492a2d9ae61e33f7f25aca7a5aaa2de1a371385206b0bb05","category":"Cycling"}
