Think small</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, the bad news. ‘New Year’s resolutions don’t work,’ says <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-fit-20\" target=\"_blank\">bike fit guru and former British Cycling physio Phil Burt</a>. ‘Research strongly shows that trying to make big changes inevitably ends in failure.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there is <i>something</i> you can do. ‘Aim instead for small, incremental changes within a sensible plan. So identify the goal, work a plan out of how to get there with sensible changes, and implement it. I’d apply this to my world of bike fit but also almost any aspect of weight loss or performance improvement in cycling.’</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Work on your cadence</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/pedalling-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/pedalling-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/pedalling-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/pedalling-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/pedalling-1-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/pedalling-1-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/pedalling-1-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/pedalling-1-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/pedalling-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/pedalling-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/pedalling-1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Joseph Branston / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘What you do this winter can really make or break your year,’ says Hunter Allen, founder and CEO of Peaks Coaching Group (<a href=\"https://www.peakscoachinggroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">peakscoachinggroup.com</a>). ‘There are some vital components to creating a good winter training programme, and one of them is using a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/best-power-meters-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">power meter</a> for focussed workouts using wattage and cadence.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Higher-cadence workouts help to maintain your ability to quickly contract and relax your muscles, and enhance that critical ability to quickly change your cadence. One of my favourites is simply one-minute fast-pedalling intervals, where you pedal over 110rpm for one minute, then return to your normal cadence for a minute, and repeat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Then, lower-cadence workouts enhance your muscular strength, which can help you to sprint and climb. Muscular strength workouts are based around short, hard intervals in the biggest gear you can manage at a low rpm.’</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our feature on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-pedal-road-bike\" target=\"_blank\">road and gravel bike bike pedalling technique</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+2\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-2-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-2-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-2-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-2-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-2-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-2-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-2-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-2-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Be consistent</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Consistency is key because the amount of training you do is the most important aspect of training,’ says coach Ric Stern (<a href=\"https://www.cyclecoach.com/\" target=\"_blank\">cyclecoach.com</a>). If you’ve got four days a week to train, set a goal to hit three of those days each week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It can be really hard to maintain high levels of training consistency, so taking a more relaxed approach will ensure you see better gains – rather than being upset because you missed a session and then overcompensating to make up lost ground.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Be gentle</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Just doing endurance training will only get you so far. If you really want to improve you’ll need to include some intensity in your training – once a week is enough,’ adds Stern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘But this can be mentally and physically draining, so accept that sometimes it can be better to miss that über-hard training session and just ride easy. Everyone needs an easy day and there’s no point hurting yourself.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/altitude-training-cycling\">How attitudes to altitude training are changing</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 159: on sale now</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-become-a-better-climber-in-just-one-month\">How to become a better climber in just one month</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-far-do-you-need-to-ride-to-lose-1kg-of-fat\">How far do you need to ride to lose 1kg of fat?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>5.

Try sweet spot training</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The second type of training that I prescribe to my athletes in the winter is called “sweet spot” training,’ says Allen. ‘When you ride just below your functional threshold power (FTP) – at approximately 88-93% of your FTP – you are said to be riding in your sweet spot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The level of physiological strain – read: pain – is relatively low, while the time you can stay in this area is quite high. Your increase in FTP is greatest when training in this area, so it gives you the most bang for your buck without causing you to peak in January.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7. Book a bike fit</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/04192922/phil_burt_performance_6-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"phil_burt_performance_6\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘This will help to refine your position on the bike, and also analyse any weaknesses or imbalances in your riding style and pedal stroke,’ says Stern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘A lot of people ride with their knees stuck out, their bodies upright and their necks sore. Working on these issues in winter will make you a far better cyclist by the summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘When it comes to pedalling, what was once thought correct – trying to apply an even force around the whole pedal stroke – we now know is wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Evidence shows us that better cyclists tend to stomp down more and pull up less, when you actually measure the forces using force-sensing pedals. Less efficient cyclists tend to pull up more.’</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-fit-20\" target=\"_blank\">How bike fit has changed: Phil Burt interview</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>8.

This makes it critical that you test them on a regular basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Understanding your strengths and weaknesses determines the type of training that you will be doing within each two to three-week period, and also will help you determine if your weakness is a barrier to success.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘If you’ve never had an objective assessment of your riding position, maybe it’s time to invest in one,’ says Burt. ‘Most people invest at the point of injury, pain, discomfort or underperformance, so get proactive for the year ahead and understand what’s sub-optimal about your setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Even if it’s nothing or relatively little, at least you will know.

Most people have no clue and are shocked when they actually record what they eat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Ten years ago counting calories was hard work, but now it’s a lot easier. A lot of people suffer with creeping weight gain, but middle-aged spread is not normal. Being skinny-fat is not normal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘People accept it – even cyclists and other active people – but there’s no reason why we should get bigger as we get older.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You need to embed habits that will support you for the next 25 years.

Buy a diary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Use a diary to keep a training log,’ says Lane. ‘It’s old-school, but combined with modern tech it can help you track improvements, which is great for motivation. The process of recording means you start to reflect on training and evaluate what went well or what didn’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riding hard into the wind might mean you rode slowly, but it might mean you rode at a high heart rate in a lactic swamp with icy wind in your face and you maintained a determined effort. You can tick this off as a mental toughness-building session. Developing self-awareness will help you set realistic and challenging goals.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>14.
