Passkeys log you in with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> rather than a password, and because on-device authentication is required, passkeys put a stop to online attacks like phishing. There's no password to steal or authentication code that can be intercepted.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSeveral popular websites and services have implemented Passkey support since Apple started using passkeys in 2022, including Twitter, Google, WhatsApp, TikTok, PayPal, Best Buy, Microsoft, PlayStation, and eBay.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPasskeys are supported in the new Passwords app that's available in ‌iOS 18‌, iPadOS 18, ‌macOS Sequoia‌, and Windows PCs through <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> for Windows. \r<br />\n<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-automatic-passkey-update/\">iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia Let Websites and Apps Automatically Update Existing Logins to Passkeys</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-and-macos-sequoia-let-websites-and-apps-automatically-update-existing-logins-to-passkeys.2428774/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e42c1e1fb677050f4d98bbbbd20ddc3febaa9e09f583d6902df09cb546b28054","category":"Apple"}
