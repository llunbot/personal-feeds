Multiple teams protested overnight, he says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tokyo2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Tokyo2020</a></p>— Tom Cary (@tomcary_tel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomcary_tel/status/1422450472560992264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 3, 2021</a></blockquote><p> </p>\n<p>According to Park, the undervests were not available for sale publicly on 1 January 2021 and therefore contravene the UCI’s strict rules on commercial availability.</p>\n<p>As a result, the Danish team did not use either the shin tape or undervests from qualifying when they faced Great Britain in the first round of heats this morning.</p>\n<p>Cary also quoted Park as saying the undervests could have contributed a “pretty significant advantage”, potentially “up to 3 per cent”.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/GettyImages-1234418729-b989887.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The controversial shin tape was nowhere to be seen during Denmark’s first-round heat versus Great Britain.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>PETER PARKS/AFP via Getty Images</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/GettyImages-1234417664-f52eb6a.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Denmark’s team pursuit squad were not wearing baselayers either, indicating the UCI may have ruled both items to be illegal for use in competition.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>GREG BAKER/AFP via Getty Images</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nAs for how Park might know how effective such undervests (or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-base-layers/\">baselayers</a> as they’re more commonly known) can be, it’s interesting to note <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2021-worldtour-bikes/\">WorldTour team</a> Ineos-Grenadiers (who have a long-standing close relationship with Great Britain) have also been using <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2021-pro-bike-tech-trends/\">baselayers with what appear to be integrated trip strips</a> for a while. As far as we can tell, Great Britain is not using these at the Tokyo Games, though.\n<p>As things stand, the UCI has not released a public statement confirming or denying the ruling, but the absence of shin tape and baselayers on the Danish squad would appear to confirm the ruling did indeed take place.</p>","author":"Simon Bromley","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"1eadf7b22cec776cc6bcc5aa7ee902fd6bfc562a9254491bd3f4c48f252866ac","category":"Cycling"}
