That is the same process that is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/a19-and-a19-pro-n3p-rumor/\">expected to be used for the A19 and A19 Pro chips</a> coming in the iPhone 17 models, so the iPhone 18 models could have relatively small overall performance improvements compared to the previous generation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPu does expect the A20 chip to have one upgrade that he said will benefit Apple Intelligence capabilities. Specifically, he said the chip will use TSMC's so-called <a href=\"https://3dfabric.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/technology/cowos.htm\">Chip on Wafer on Substrate (CoWoS)</a> packaging technology, which would allow for tighter integration of the chip's processor, unified memory, and Neural Engine.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf this information is accurate, the first iPhone chip to use TSMC's 2nm technology would be the A21 chip in 2027 at the earliest.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-18/\">iPhone 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/a20-chip-still-3nm-rumor/\">A20 Chip for iPhones Said to Remain 3nm, But With Key Upgrade for Apple Intelligence</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/a20-chip-for-iphones-said-to-remain-3nm-but-with-key-upgrade-for-apple-intelligence.2453368/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"03c3092e788aa19d1aa0d4714d6dc4f37e73ab9c2ed72dc8554f2570dbc20348","category":"Apple"}
