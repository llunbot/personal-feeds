Once again the Swedish watchmaker gives followers of the Giro d’Italia a new way to show off their cycling fandom. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s undeniably a luxury to buy an expensive hand-crafted mechanical watch. But cyclists are already known for spending a lot more than this on high-tech bike kit they don’t necessarily need. There are plenty of wheelsets alone that we’ve covered that cost more than one of these watches. Not to mention a slew of bikes 4-6x as much. So maybe, it’s not such an extravagance?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think?
