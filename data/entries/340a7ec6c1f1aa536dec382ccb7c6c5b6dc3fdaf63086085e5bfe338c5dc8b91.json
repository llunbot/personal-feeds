(There’s also a Black Friday deal going on that knocks £1,000 off both models!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The original Rambler spec gives it Campagnolo Ekar, Hunt Gravel X Wide wheels, and a housebrand cockpit with carbon seatpost. That post is 27.2, and the sloping top tube gives you most post extension so it can flex more under your weight. Claimed weight for this model is 14.3kg, MSRP is ~$5,200 (£4,289).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cairn-e-adventure-e-gravel-bike-3.jpg\"><img width=\"1296\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cairn-e-adventure-e-gravel-bike-3.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of cairn e-adventure electric gravel bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cairn-e-adventure-e-gravel-bike-3.jpg 1296w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cairn-e-adventure-e-gravel-bike-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cairn-e-adventure-e-gravel-bike-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cairn-e-adventure-e-gravel-bike-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cairn-e-adventure-e-gravel-bike-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cairn-e-adventure-e-gravel-bike-3-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new SRAM Rival build comes in at $4,245 (£3,489) with a 1×11 mechanical shifting and a SunRace 11-42 cassette. It gets a Ritchey RL1 Balquiano flared handlebar, and both models get Vittoria gravel tires. Claimed weight is also 14.3kg.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cairn-e-adventure-e-gravel-bike-2.jpg\"><img width=\"1296\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cairn-e-adventure-e-gravel-bike-2.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of cairn e-adventure electric gravel bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cairn-e-adventure-e-gravel-bike-2.jpg 1296w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cairn-e-adventure-e-gravel-bike-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cairn-e-adventure-e-gravel-bike-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cairn-e-adventure-e-gravel-bike-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cairn-e-adventure-e-gravel-bike-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cairn-e-adventure-e-gravel-bike-2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame and carbon fork clear 700×45 gravel tires, and the frame has rack, fender, and anything cage mounts.
