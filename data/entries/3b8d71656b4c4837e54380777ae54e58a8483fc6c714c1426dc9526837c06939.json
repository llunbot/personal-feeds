The court's decision effectively reverses a previous verdict that had halted the probe, reinforcing the authority of the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/app-store-blue-banner-uk-fixed.jpg\" width=\"1794\" height=\"1009\" />\r<br />\nIn November 2022, the CMA <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/22/uk-cma-market-probe-apple-google/\">launched an investigation</a> into the cloud gaming and mobile browser restrictions put in place by both Apple and Google, suggesting that the two companies were holding back innovation and increasing costs for web developers, cloud gaming service providers, and browser vendors. This decision was initially <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/31/uk-apple-browser-probe-shut-down/\">overturned</a> by the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), which agreed with Apple that the CMA <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/31/uk-apple-browser-probe-shut-down/\">took too long to open an investigation</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Court of Appeal's latest judgment clarified that the CMA acted within its legal bounds, rejecting Apple's argument regarding time limits. The ruling emphasized that such restrictions apply only to consultation processes within a market study and do not limit the CMA's broader investigative powers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe court highlighted the CMA's role in promoting competition and safeguarding consumer interests, pointing out the potential \"serious consequences\" of restricting these powers. The CMA's investigation, which remains paused pending Apple's option of a Supreme Court appeal, is set to resume efforts to scrutinize the company's influence in the mobile browser market and its approach to cloud gaming on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/uk-revives-antitrust-probe-into-apple-restrictions/\">UK Revives Antitrust Probe Into Apple's Browser and Cloud Gaming Restrictions</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/uk-revives-antitrust-probe-into-apples-browser-and-cloud-gaming-restrictions.2412483/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3b8d71656b4c4837e54380777ae54e58a8483fc6c714c1426dc9526837c06939","category":"Apple"}
