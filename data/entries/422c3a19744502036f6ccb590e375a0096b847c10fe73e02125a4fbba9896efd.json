The tyre uses Specialized’s T7/T5 dual-compound design, which is intended to offer better speed in a straight line and improved grip when cornering.</p>\n<p>We don’t know what width the Specialized riders were running, but given broader trends, it’s likely to be in the 2.3 to 2.4in range.</p>\n<h2>More prototype suspension</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lenzerheide XC tech gallery – more new XC tech\" title=\"Lenzerheide XC tech gallery – more new XC tech\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> RockShox’s new SID appears to use a new damper.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Finlay Anderson / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Schurter’s Flight Attendant-equipped Spark may have hogged the limelight, but there was plenty of other suspension tech to be found in the pits.</p>\n<p>New versions of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/2021-rockshox-sid-ultimate-fork-review/\">RockShox SID</a> appeared on a number of bikes in both the men’s and women’s fields. Some of these appeared to feature a new version of the RockShox Charger Race Day damper. Assuming this follows standard RockShox naming conventions, we guess it will be called the Charger Race Day 2.</p>\n<p>Naturally, the new forks were hooked up to a remote lockout, with both the Canyon Collective and Trek Factory Racing teams using a new, slimmer version of RockShox’s TwistLoc remote.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lenzerheide XC tech gallery – more new XC tech\" title=\"Lenzerheide XC tech gallery – more new XC tech\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> These link-style cables drop a few grams over the standard outer.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Finlay Anderson / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>XC riders are notorious weight weenies, with Trek’s mechanics taking this to the extreme.
