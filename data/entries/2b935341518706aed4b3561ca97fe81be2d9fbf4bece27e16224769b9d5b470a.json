The attacks, which began no later than June 12 and are likely ongoing, allow the threat actors to install \"VersaMem,” the name Lumen gave to a custom web shell that gives remote administrative control of Versa Director systems.</p>\n<h2>Getting admin control of ISP infrastructure</h2>\n<p>The administrative control allows VersaMem to run with the necessary privileges to hook the Versa authentication methods, meaning the web shell can hijack the execution flow to make it introduce new functions. One of the functions VersaMem added includes capturing credentials at the moment an ISP customer enters them and before they are cryptographically hashed. Once in possession of the credentials, the threat actors work to compromise the customers. Black Lotus didn’t identify any of the affected ISPs, MSPs, or downstream customers.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045401#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045401&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2b935341518706aed4b3561ca97fe81be2d9fbf4bece27e16224769b9d5b470a","category":"Tech"}
