Unlike Myspace, the songs don't autoplay when someone visits a user's profile. Visitors can play and pause the song - or song sample, since the duration of the music is capped at 30 seconds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"We're excited to announce that you can now add a song to your profile, giving you more ways to express yourself through music,\" Instagram said in a <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@creators/post/C--rFylx7Be\">post</a> from its creators account. \"Your profile song selection will be live until you swap out the song.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo add a song, users need to go to the \"edit profile\" page and select \"Add music to your profile,\" where they can search for and select a track from Instagram's library of licensed music (the same music that can be used in Reels or posts).\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new feature is being launched in collaboration with singer Sabrina Carpenter, whose profile features a teaser of her new song, \"Taste,\" ahead of its official release later this week. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instagram/\">Instagram</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/23/instagram-song-on-profile-feature/\">Instagram Gains Myspace-Style 'Song on Profile' Feature</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/instagram-gains-myspace-style-song-on-profile-feature.2434217/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c29c9b0dabc3f87ef1fb677e29e6ddaba868099d6a4344b2380b09921e71b7ca","category":"Apple"}
