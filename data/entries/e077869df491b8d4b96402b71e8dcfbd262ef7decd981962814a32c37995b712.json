The \nlegislation, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2024/tiktok-ban-house-vote/\">approved 352 to 65</a>, is a sweeping bipartisan \nrebuke of the popular video-sharing app — and an attempt to \ngrapple with allegations that TikTok’s China-based parent, \nByteDance, presents national security risks. </p>\n\n<p>For years, lawmakers have been introducing proposals seeking to \nrestrict the company’s activities in the U.S., and finding limited \nmomentum. But these lengthy behind-the-scenes deliberations were \nhastened, lawmakers said, by the Biden administration’s growing \nsupport of the effort, coupled with concerns about TikTok’s \npotential to influence U.S. politics, which <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/02/tiktok-israel-hamas-video-brainwash/\">intensified</a> after \nthe Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel. </p>\n\n<p>Private briefings from national security and law enforcement \nofficials, including a classified hearing last week, served as a \n“call to action” for Congress to “finally” take a stand against \nTikTok, said Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), a member of the House \nEnergy and Commerce Committee. It’s unclear whether these meetings \nwith the FBI, Justice Department and Office of the Director of the \nNational Intelligence surfaced new evidence against the company. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems pretty clear those briefings <em>did</em> surface alarming evidence. The two concerns about TikTok are that (a) the Chinese government is using it to surveil  Americans; and (b) that it serves as a powerful propaganda vehicle for the PRC. It’s the letter concern — propaganda — that has had me <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2020/08/on_tiktok_as_a_security_threat\">calling for a TikTok ban (or divestiture by ByteDance) for years</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/13/house-passes-tiktok-ban\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e077869df491b8d4b96402b71e8dcfbd262ef7decd981962814a32c37995b712","category":"Tech"}
