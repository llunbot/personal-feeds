Small, isolated populations of animals lead to inbreeding and genetic defects, and it has long been thought that the Wrangel Island mammoths ultimately succumbed to this problem about 4,000 years ago.</p>\n<p>A paper in Cell on Thursday, however, compared 50,000 years of genomes from mainland and isolated Wrangel Island mammoths and found that this was not the case. What the authors of the paper discovered not only challenges our understanding of this isolated group of mammoths and the evolution of small populations, it also has important implications for conservation efforts today.</p>\n<h2>A severe bottleneck</h2>\n<p>It’s the culmination of years of genetic sequencing by members of the international team behind this new paper. They studied 21 mammoth genomes—13 of which were newly sequenced by lead author Marianne Dehasque; others had been sequenced years prior by co-authors Patrícia Pečnerová, Foteini Kanellidou, and Héloïse Muller. The genomes were obtained from Siberian woolly mammoths (<i>Mammuthus primigenius</i>), both from the mainland and the island before and after it became isolated. The oldest genome was from a female Siberian mammoth who died about 52,300 years ago. The youngest were from Wrangel Island male mammoths who perished right around the time the last of these mammoths died out (one of them died just 4,333 years ago).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034436#p3\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034436&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jeanne Timmons","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"df9647f7edffdfd1db629bf9ae5d96769e13e06ad37ca3e6bcc430d301c2aef5","category":"Tech"}
