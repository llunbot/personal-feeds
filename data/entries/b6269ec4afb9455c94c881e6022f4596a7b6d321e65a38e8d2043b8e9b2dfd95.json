He taught us to be open to the beauty of the world, to be curious around new ideas, to see around the next corner, and most of all to stay humble in our own beginner's mind.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere are many things we still see through his eyes, but he also\r\n<br />\r\ntaught to look for ourselves. He gave us equipment for living,\r\n<br />\r\nand it has served us well.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOne of our greatest sources of consolation has been our association of Steve with beauty. The sight of something beautiful — a wooded hillside, a well‑made object — recalls his spirit to us. Even in his years of suffering, he never lost his faith in the beauty of existence.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMemory is inadequate for what is in our hearts: we miss him profoundly. We were blessed to have him as husband and father.</blockquote>Also in commemoration, Apple's former design chief Jony Ive has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/04/jony-ive-shares-remembrance-of-steve-jobs/\">penned a remembrance</a> of his friend and colleague for the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> Magazine.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/steve-jobs/\">Steve Jobs</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/05/apple-10th-anniversary-steve-jobs-death/\">Apple Commemorates 10th Anniversary of Steve Jobs' Passing</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-commemorates-10th-anniversary-of-steve-jobs-passing.2315453/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lmgZ_qeMSgA:MB3gQs5X6hw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lmgZ_qeMSgA:MB3gQs5X6hw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/lmgZ_qeMSgA\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b6269ec4afb9455c94c881e6022f4596a7b6d321e65a38e8d2043b8e9b2dfd95","category":"Apple"}
