The new U.L. FUN Drip 2.0 looks like a clever design that would make your #coffeeoutside kit a lot lighter. The Ultra-Light Fun Drip 2.0 weighs a mere 11g (the same weight as 12 M&amp;Ms or one Oreo cookie) and is made of 100% recyclable expanded polypropylene. It can be washed and used again and again. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Yamatomo-UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-Coffee-dripper-pour-over1.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Yamatomo-UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-Coffee-dripper-pour-over1-800x450.webp\" alt=\"UL Fun Drip 2.0 tasty pour over\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Yamatomo-UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-Coffee-dripper-pour-over1-800x450.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Yamatomo-UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-Coffee-dripper-pour-over1-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Yamatomo-UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-Coffee-dripper-pour-over1-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Yamatomo-UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-Coffee-dripper-pour-over1-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Yamatomo-UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-Coffee-dripper-pour-over1-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Yamatomo-UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-Coffee-dripper-pour-over1-400x225.webp 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Yamatomo-UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-Coffee-dripper-pour-over1-1200x675.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Yamatomo-UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-Coffee-dripper-pour-over1.webp 1920w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.L. Fun Drip 2.0 is a true cone-shaped coffee dripper that is so slim, sleek, and light, that it can be easily stuffed in the crevices of your coffee outside kit, bikepacking, camping, or hiking gear. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-in-four-colors.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"528\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-in-four-colors-800x528.jpg\" alt=\"UL Fun Drip 2.0 in four colors\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-in-four-colors-800x528.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-in-four-colors-297x196.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-in-four-colors-120x79.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-in-four-colors-768x507.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-in-four-colors.jpg 931w\" /></a><figcaption>Four color options with available LokSak storage bag</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It actually is said to fold down to only 1mm thick. It even comes in four colors, yellow, light blue, light grey, and dark grey. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the OG U.L. Fun Drip, the 2.0 offers expanded compatibility with various cup sizes ensuring a seamless transition from dripper to drinker. They also added a “stopper” that will make the 2.0 easier to use in the wind, leaving the drip process undisturbed. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-fits-in-an-envelope.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"448\" height=\"253\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-fits-in-an-envelope.jpg\" alt=\"UL Fun Drip 2.0 fits in an envelope\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-fits-in-an-envelope.jpg 448w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-fits-in-an-envelope-297x168.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-fits-in-an-envelope-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UL-Fun-Drip-2.0-fits-in-an-envelope-400x225.jpg 400w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the U.L.
