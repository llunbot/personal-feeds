First, the new model, CFI-1102A, runs 0.6 pounds lighter compared to the original console, although Sony has given no indication about what has changed. Back in May, reports emerged that a new <a href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-has-seemingly-referenced-a-new-ps5-model-in-product-registration-documents/\">wireless module</a> was planned, and that’s likely what is inside these tweaked consoles. The update applies to both the digital and disc versions.\n<p>Secondly, and most importantly, there’s a new screw for the console’s annoying and required base/stand. While the screw isn’t necessary when the system is placed in a horizontal position (there’s a small compartment to store the screw), anyone setting up a PS5 vertically needs the screw to keep the stand stable. The revised screw can be tightened by hand thanks to a new grip around the head. While that doesn’t make aligning the base/stand any easier, you no longer need a screwdriver to do the operation.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/screw2.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/screw2-980x551.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/screw2.jpg\"></a> </p></div>\n<p>The console, which has been plagued by a scalper market since launch, remains in short supply. A quick glance at eBay auctions shows new PS5s still consistently running near $700–$900, well over the $400–$500 MSRP, depending on edition. Apps like <a href=\"https://www.stockinformer.com/checker-ps5-console-playstation-5\">StockInformer</a> can alert those who are still trying to track one down—minus the reseller premium.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789108\">Read on Ars Technica</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789108&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Matt Paprocki","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"040f67d9a75717f72d36bfe789bc52dd4d670d7ee493140384b74fa11fd68644","category":"Tech"}
