And today, you can get one for a crazy low price: <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1668250-REG/apple_mbp_14_sg_50_14_2_macbook_pro_with.html?BI=21883&amp;KBID=28249&amp;SID=1-1-1923775-1-0-0\"><s>B&amp;H Photo is selling a fully loaded 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 Max processor, 64GB of RAM, and 8TB of storage for $3,999</s></a>. B&amp;H Photo is selling the <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1668246-REG/apple_mbp_14_sg_46_14_2_macbook_pro_with.html?BI=21883&amp;KBID=28249&amp;SID=1-1-1923775-1-0-0\">14-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 Max processor, 64GB of RAM, and 2TB of storage for $2,799</a>, a savings of $1,300 and the best price we’ve ever seen on this configuration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though you’re getting an older machine it’s still a monster. It has Apple’s top-of-the-line M1 Max processor with a 10-core CPU and 32-core GPU, 64GB of RAM, and 8TB of storage, the most you can get in this machine. You’re also getting a brilliant 14.2-inch display with ProMotion, a fantastic keyboard, and lots of expansion, including three Thunderbolt ports, an SD card reader, and HDMI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than the chip, there are only three differences between this laptop and the 2023 M2 model: WiFi 6E instead of WiFi 6 (which only matters if you have a WiFi 6E router), Bluetooth 5.3 instead of 5.0 (which has no discernible difference at the moment), and HDMI 2.1 instead of 2.0 (which lets you connect <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1485454/how-to-connect-an-8k-display-to-your-mac.html\">an 8K display</a>). But when it comes to performance, this machine will still handle everything you can throw at it for years and years to come.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0e15c8959cb7da88e70b9e858099145625859dcf26ec2ca5d9ea272a8a397dab","category":"Apple"}
