{"title":"M2 Ultra Chip Benchmark Results Reveal Impressive Performance Gains","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/10/m2-ultra-chip-benchmarks/","date":1686419119000,"content":"The <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/search?k=v6_cpu&amp;q=M2+Ultra&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93\">first benchmark results</a> for Apple's new M2 Ultra chip have surfaced on Geekbench 6, providing a closer look at CPU performance improvements. The high-end chip is available in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/mac-studio-m2-max-m2-ultra-chips/\">new Mac Studio</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/apple-introduces-new-mac-pro-with-m2-ultra-chip-available-to-order-starting-today/\">Mac Pro</a> models launching next week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-M2-Ultra-Chip.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThere is currently some variance in the results, but the Mac Studio with the M2 Ultra chip appears to have single-core and multi-core scores of up to approximately 2,800 and 21,700, respectively. As expected, these scores confirm that the M2 Ultra chip offers up to 20% faster CPU performance compared to the M1 Ultra chip, as Apple advertised. This also means the M2 Ultra is now the fastest chip that Apple has ever released.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Geekbench-M2-Ultra.jpg\" alt width=\"1502\" height=\"774\" /><div><em>Geekbench 6 result for Mac Studio with M2 Ultra chip</em></div>\r<br />\nMore interestingly, the scores reveal that the new Mac Pro should have around 2× faster overall CPU performance than the <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/mac-pro-late-2019-intel-xeon-w-3275m-2-5-ghz-28-cores\">fastest Intel-based Mac Pro</a> with a 28-core Xeon W processor. This feat is even more impressive given that the new Mac Pro starts at $6,999, while the 28-core Intel-based model started at $12,999, nearly double the price. During its WWDC keynote, Apple said the new Mac Pro is up to 3× faster than the Intel-based model, but that only applies to select \"real-world pro workflows like video transcoding and 3D simulation.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe primary reason to consider the Mac Pro over the Mac Studio is for the desktop tower's six available PCIe expansion slots. Otherwise, customers should consider the Mac Studio, as it can be configured with the M2 Ultra for $3,000 less than the Mac Pro.
