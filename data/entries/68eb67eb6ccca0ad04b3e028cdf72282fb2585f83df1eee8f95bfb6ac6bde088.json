The pricing changes are set to go into effect on October 8.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPricing on the Disney Bundle that includes access to Hulu ad-supported content, Disney+, and ESPN+ is not changing, and it will continue to be available for $13.99. The Disney Bundle with ad-free Hulu is still $19.99.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNow that there's a $1 price difference between the ad-free Hulu subscription and the lower tier Disney Bundle, customers may be more willing to choose the Disney bundle to get access to all three Disney streaming services.
