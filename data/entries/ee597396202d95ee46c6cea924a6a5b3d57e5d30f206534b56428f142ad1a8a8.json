The UCI – the world cycling governing body, has rubber-stamped the ACE as fair game in the peloton. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UCI seems to be extra generous (and petty) this year. They’ve also approved the<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/uci-approved-nix-biosensors-hydration-monitoring/\"> NIX Biosensor for in-competition use</a>, and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/op-ed-ritchey-wcs-in-monochrome-sadly-no-more-world-champ-rainbows/\">ended their world champ stripes agreement with Ritchey after three decades. </a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wahoo-ACE-UCI-EF--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wahoo-ACE-UCI-EF--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Wahoo ACE UCI EF\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wahoo-ACE-UCI-EF--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wahoo-ACE-UCI-EF--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wahoo-ACE-UCI-EF--1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wahoo-ACE-UCI-EF--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wahoo-ACE-UCI-EF--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wahoo-ACE-UCI-EF--2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wahoo-ACE-UCI-EF--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wahoo-ACE-UCI-EF--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Wahoo</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Will this give Wahoo ELEMNT ACE users an unfair advantage? </em></strong>In the ACE’s current state, probably not. However, this is the first time Wahoo and World Tour teams can get their hands on these numbers from every team member in intense, high-stakes racing. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-ELEMNT-ACE-unit-side--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-ELEMNT-ACE-unit-side--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Wahoo ELEMNT ACE unit side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-ELEMNT-ACE-unit-side--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-ELEMNT-ACE-unit-side--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-ELEMNT-ACE-unit-side--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-ELEMNT-ACE-unit-side--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-ELEMNT-ACE-unit-side--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-ELEMNT-ACE-unit-side--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Jordan Villella/Bikerumor</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For those unfamiliar, the all-new ELEMNT ACE is the largest cycling computer we’ve tested (unless you consider a phone a computer) and Wahoo’s most advanced bike computer to date. The new ELEMNT ACE computer boasts many updates and Wahoo ecosystem integrations. However it’s large, heavy, and I don’t think the pros need the mapping help — but it does have a pretty cool extra feature.

This data doesn’t just give cyclists a number; it could help them adjust their drafting position and optimize aero efficiency. Post-ride, the team can sit down and quantify the effects of wind and wattage in real-time. Check the very limited example bellow from a personal ride with the Wahoo ELEMNT ACE. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-ELEMNT-ACE-WWD-1--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1183\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-ELEMNT-ACE-WWD-1--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Wahoo-ELEMNT-ACE-WWD-1-\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-ELEMNT-ACE-WWD-1--scaled.webp 1183w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-ELEMNT-ACE-WWD-1--139x300.webp 139w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-ELEMNT-ACE-WWD-1--55x120.webp 55w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-ELEMNT-ACE-WWD-1--768x1662.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-ELEMNT-ACE-WWD-1--710x1536.webp 710w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Wahoo-ELEMNT-ACE-WWD-1--947x2048.webp 947w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Jordan Villella/Bikerumor</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br />Wahoo believes that over time, its Wind Dynamics system will generate the largest real-world cycling wind dataset, enhancing performance analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wahoo-ACE-UCI-UAE-front--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1710\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wahoo-ACE-UCI-UAE-front--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Wahoo ACE UCI UAE front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wahoo-ACE-UCI-UAE-front--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wahoo-ACE-UCI-UAE-front--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wahoo-ACE-UCI-UAE-front--1536x1026.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wahoo-ACE-UCI-UAE-front--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wahoo-ACE-UCI-UAE-front--768x513.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wahoo-ACE-UCI-UAE-front--2048x1368.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wahoo-ACE-UCI-UAE-front--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wahoo-ACE-UCI-UAE-front--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Wahoo</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What Do Riders See Using <strong>Wahoo Wind Dynamics</strong>?</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Right now, riders see two key insights:</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AirDrag:</strong> How much their groundspeed is <strong>hindered by headwinds</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>AirBoost:</strong> How much their groundspeed is <strong>aided by tailwinds or drafting</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/unreleased-new-SRAM-Red-road-bike-groupset_raced-by-Lidl-Trek-at-2024-Giro-d-Italia_photo-by-Getty-Images.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/unreleased-new-SRAM-Red-road-bike-groupset_raced-by-Lidl-Trek-at-2024-Giro-d-Italia_photo-by-Getty-Images.jpg\" alt=\"unreleased new SRAM Red road bike groupset, raced by Lidl-Trek at 2024 Giro d Italia\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/unreleased-new-SRAM-Red-road-bike-groupset_raced-by-Lidl-Trek-at-2024-Giro-d-Italia_photo-by-Getty-Images.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/unreleased-new-SRAM-Red-road-bike-groupset_raced-by-Lidl-Trek-at-2024-Giro-d-Italia_photo-by-Getty-Images-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/unreleased-new-SRAM-Red-road-bike-groupset_raced-by-Lidl-Trek-at-2024-Giro-d-Italia_photo-by-Getty-Images-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/unreleased-new-SRAM-Red-road-bike-groupset_raced-by-Lidl-Trek-at-2024-Giro-d-Italia_photo-by-Getty-Images-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/unreleased-new-SRAM-Red-road-bike-groupset_raced-by-Lidl-Trek-at-2024-Giro-d-Italia_photo-by-Getty-Images-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/unreleased-new-SRAM-Red-road-bike-groupset_raced-by-Lidl-Trek-at-2024-Giro-d-Italia_photo-by-Getty-Images-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo SRAM/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Who’s Riding the ELEMNT ACE?

However, the ACE is not only a huge step up in terms of software and hardware, but the additional metric of wind speed sets it apart from other devices in the game. Our riders can use real-time data to optimize their position on the bike or in the bunch to save energy—providing them with valuable insights that translate into performance gains.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_EF-development.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_EF-development.webp\" alt=\"Rapha Pro Team Roadsuit aero road bike racing skinsuit, EF Pro Cycling R&amp;D wind tunnel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_EF-development.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_EF-development-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_EF-development-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_EF-development-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Rapha-Pro-Team-Roadsuit-road-racing-skinsuit_EF-development-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Rapha</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Peter Schep, Head of Performance at EF Pro Cycling, adds:<br /></strong><em>“The new ELEMNT ACE brings wind speed data in real-time, which we think could be a game-changer in drafting dynamics.
