It was the first of a whole range of new electric vehicles from General Motors built on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/03/general-motors-announces-new-battery-platform-claims-100kwh-soon/\">shared electric powertrain components</a>. Compared to more recent Ultium-based EVs from GM, the Lyriq launch went relatively smoothly, despite pre-production test vehicles. Hype was so great that Cadillac was said to have increased the first year's production run by almost a factor of 10.</p>\n<p>But customers faced a long wait for their orders as the company stumbled at the step where cells get turned into battery packs. Now the production kinks have been worked out, and Lyriqs are becoming a more common sight. So it seemed like a reasonable time to check in on the electric Caddy.</p>\n<p>We've written <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/08/cadillac-reveals-the-lyriq-its-new-long-range-electric-suv/\">quite a lot</a> in the past <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/not-your-grandpas-ride-the-2023-cadillac-lyriq-tested/\">about the Lyriq's Ultium powertrain</a>, so I won't repeat too much detail here. For model-year 2024, the underpinnings remain the same, although our test car is an all-wheel-drive version. (Cadillac only had the rear-wheel-drive variant at the first drive in 2022.) There are a pair of new trims, Tech and Sport—this test car was the top-of-the-line Sport 3, with a $78,295 sticker price (including delivery charge).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027785#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027785&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
