Starling Cycles is offering a tiny batch of 26” wheeled MTBs, called the Dive. They’ve apparently been thinking about reintroducing a 26” MTB, and finally decided to go for it. Today’s launch date puts an ironic twist on the fact that it’s not a joke at all! In their own words, “Maybe we’re the fools, let’s find out!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only does the Dive give off retro vibes with its 26” wheels, but it’s also made from steel and boasts a single-pivot suspension linkage. Starling is offering the Dive as a frame only, frame/shock, or even complete builds at the customer’s request.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Starling Dive – Frame Features:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-side.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-side.webp\" alt=\"Starling Cycles Dive, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-side.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-side-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-side-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-side-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-side-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-side-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now this isn’t just an adaptation of a 27.5” frame, Starling wants to make it clear they designed the Dive from the ground up as a 26” specific bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The name ‘Dive’ was inspired by the dingy Bristol dive bars Starling’s Joe McEwan liked to party in while racing single-pivot 26” MTBs towards the podiums. Both the retro bikes and cheap grungy bars provoke nostalgic feelings of fun and good times… but no regrets about moving up and onward!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-rear-shock.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-rear-shock.webp\" alt=\"Starling Cycles Dive, rear shock\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-rear-shock.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-rear-shock-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-rear-shock-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-rear-shock-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-rear-shock-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-rear-shock-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dive is a 160mm travel single-pivot full-suspension MTB. Given that long travel 26” suspension forks are not very available these days, Starling has built the Dive’s front end around a 170mm travel, 27.5” Fox 38 fork – but it is intended to run a 26” wheel. If you buy a rear shock from Starling, they’ll provide a Fox DHX2 Factory Coil (230x65mm).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starling’s adjustable shock mount is included on The Dive, so the frame’s travel can be reduced to 135mm if you run a 210x55mm rear shock. Starling recommends a fork of similar travel to maintain the Dive’s intended geometry.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-head-tube-gusset.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-head-tube-gusset.webp\" alt=\"Starling Cycles Dive, head tube gusset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-head-tube-gusset.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-head-tube-gusset-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-head-tube-gusset-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-head-tube-gusset-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-head-tube-gusset-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-head-tube-gusset-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame’s front triangle is built by hand in Bristol, UK, and constructed from Reynolds 853 steel tubing. The rear triangle is made from heat treated chromoly. Despite its retro flair, the Dive was built with all the DNA of a modern Starling V3 bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dive frame features an extra tough anti-flare tapered headtube, and an aluminum seat mast insert to eliminate seized posts.The frame fits 31.6mm posts and is routed for droppers, and its rear end offers generous tire clearance for treads up to 26×2.6”.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-machined-BB-junction.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-machined-BB-junction.webp\" alt=\"Starling Cycles, machined BB junction\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-machined-BB-junction.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-machined-BB-junction-297x238.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-machined-BB-junction-120x96.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-machined-BB-junction-768x614.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>This photo is not the Dive frame, but a good shot Starling provided to show their machined BB junction.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another unique frame detail is the machined BB shell/main pivot junction. Introduced with their V3 frames, this piece hosts a 73mm threaded BB, and is stiffer and stronger than their outgoing design.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-UDH-dropout.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-UDH-dropout.webp\" alt=\"Starling Cycles Dive, UDH dropout\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-UDH-dropout.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-UDH-dropout-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-UDH-dropout-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-UDH-dropout-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-UDH-dropout-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-UDH-dropout-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Some modern touches on the Dive include a UDH derailleur hanger, and a Boost 148x12mm rear axle. The Dive also gets an integrated upper chain guide, and an ISCG05 bash guard mount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cable routing remains fully external, and there is one water bottle mount on all frame sizes. The small’s is on the bottom of the down tube while medium and large frames get one on the underside of the top tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dive’s frame geometry is up to date with today’s numbers, ensuring the bike can shred modern trails. Small, medium, and large frame sizes are available.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-geometry-chart.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1110\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-geometry-chart.webp\" alt=\"Starling Cycles Dive, geometry chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-geometry-chart.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-geometry-chart-297x275.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-geometry-chart-120x111.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-geometry-chart-768x710.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the Dive does run a 27.5” fork, you could of course set it up as a 26/27.5” MX bike. However, that’s not in the spirit of this retro build, so Starling only provided geometry numbers for 26” wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Build Options:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-rear-angle.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-rear-angle.webp\" alt=\"Starling Cycles Dive, rear angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-rear-angle.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-rear-angle-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-rear-angle-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-rear-angle-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-rear-angle-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-rear-angle-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dive frame only sells for £2046.67. Buyers can add a Fox DHX2 Factory Coil shock for an extra £537.50. Starling does offer the option of a complete build by request, but since that would be fully custom no specs or prices were provided.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-frame-853-tubing.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-frame-853-tubing.webp\" alt=\"Starling Cycles Dive, 853 tubing closeup\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-frame-853-tubing.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-frame-853-tubing-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-frame-853-tubing-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-frame-853-tubing-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-frame-853-tubing-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starling-Cycles-Dive-frame-853-tubing-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>All photos c. Jamie Edwards</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As one last special touch, the Dive will be available in a unique IPA/Dark Lacquer raw finish. This finish keeps the frame’s unpainted aesthetic but protects it against rust. The Dive is debuting this new finish, which will later become available on all of Starling’s bikes. Starling is also offering Dive frames in four other colors: Steel is Teal, Powder Pink, Landy Green and Anodic Bronze.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starling Cycles will be accepting orders for the Dive until May 1<sup>st</sup>, or until they’re sold! Frames will be available in 8-12 weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.starlingcycles.com/frames/dive-26-inch/\">starlingcycles.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/starling-cycles-revives-26-wheels-with-the-dive/\">Starling Cycles Revives 26” Wheels with The Dive</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"77edaa89f6631ac8977f7330cfddb1466699d533a4ec97e2a42b11a54c304c6c","category":"Cycling"}
