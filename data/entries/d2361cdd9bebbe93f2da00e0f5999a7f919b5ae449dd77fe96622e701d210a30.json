The significant refresh to the product line could boost Apple's sluggish tablet sales next year.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-keyboard/\">Magic Keyboard</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/\">OLED iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/27/new-ipad-pro-and-redesigned-magic-keyboard/\">Gurman: Redesigned Magic Keyboard to Accompany New iPad Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-redesigned-magic-keyboard-to-accompany-new-ipad-pro.2399784/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d2361cdd9bebbe93f2da00e0f5999a7f919b5ae449dd77fe96622e701d210a30","category":"Apple"}
