He said the speaker will be equipped with Apple's own combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip, which <strong>supports Wi-Fi 6E</strong>. It is unclear if the chip's Wi-Fi 6E support will be enabled for the new HomePod mini, but if it is, that would allow for faster wireless connectivity compared to the current model's Wi-Fi 4 support. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile there are no other rumors yet, likely upgrades for the next HomePod mini include a <strong>newer \"S\" chip, improved sound quality, a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip</strong> for a lower-latency Handoff experience, and <strong>new color options</strong>. The current HomePod mini is equipped with the S5 chip, which debuted in 2019's Apple Watch Series 5.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to a new HomePod mini, Apple reportedly plans to release an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/\">all-new smart home hub</a> as soon as March next year. The hub is expected to feature around a 6-inch display that can be mounted on a wall, or attached to a tabletop base with a speaker, so the device could be similar to the HomePod mini in some ways.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is unclear if the next HomePod mini will have Siri improvements, as unlike the home hub, the speaker is not expected to get Apple Intelligence.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCheck out our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini roundup</a> for more details.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini\">HomePod Mini (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/17/what-to-expect-from-2025-homepod-mini/\">What to Expect From the HomePod Mini 2 Rumored to Launch Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-the-homepod-mini-2-rumored-to-launch-next-year.2445646/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0a8faaa022838bc2000fbcfa061661f2bb6ae8a82475864680c01e1cde65b76b","category":"Apple"}
