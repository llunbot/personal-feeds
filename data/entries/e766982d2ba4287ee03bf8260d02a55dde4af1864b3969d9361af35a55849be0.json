They add some extra power on the flat too.</p>\n<p>You can turn your focus to climbing the steepest, most technical slopes you can find – or just go longer and faster with a grin from ear-to-ear. The ability to cover ground quickly means you can go out and explore places you wouldn’t otherwise consider.</p>\n<p>These bikes also enable you to ride in ways you usually couldn’t. As designs become more refined, their handling increasingly rivals – and in some cases exceeds – that of non-assisted <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike/\">mountain bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>For more on what to look for when buying an e-MTB, read our buyer’s guide at the bottom of this article.

You can add a 252Wh range extender.</p>\n<p>The H10’s frame has nicely smoothed welds at the top tube junctions that could fool you into thinking it’s carbon, and side-on it’s not obvious there’s a battery in the down tube either. Geometry is trail-oriented and modern but not cutting-edge.</p>\n<p>With its higher-torque motor than the Specialized Turbo Levo SL, the Rise feels more powerful on climbs. It can handle rougher, steeper trails, although it’s not as sure-footed as more enduro-oriented ebikes. It’s happiest on rollercoaster singletrack and berms though.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/orbea-rise-h10-review/\">Read

Our reviewer rated it the “best bike he’d ever ridden”.</p>\n<p>The Brose motor pushes out up to 565 watts and 90Nm for impressive climbing with smooth power delivery and there’s battery capacity to stay the course. The rest of the spec is as top-drawer as you’d expect.</p>\n<p>With 150mm of suspension travel and variable geometry, the bike can be fine-tuned to whatever you want to ride, although we swapped out the tyres for something better able to keep up with the rest of the bike’s capabilities.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/specialized-s-works-turbo-levo-review/\">Read our full Specialized S-Works Turbo Levo review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Specialized Turbo Levo Expert</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Turbo Levo Expert full suspension mountain eBike -

That drops the bike’s weight and ups agility over more heavily built machines.</p>\n<p>You’ll find e-MTBs with either 29in or 27.5in wheels, but ‘<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-faster-mullet-bike-29er/\">mullet builds</a>’ with a 29in wheel up front and a 27.5in rear are becoming increasingly common. This setup gives good stability at the front and better agility from the smaller rear wheel. Examples include the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-canyon-spectral-on/\">Canyon Spectral:ON</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/vitus-e-escarpe-vrx-review/\">Vitus E-Escarpe</a>.</p>\n<p>Most e-MTBs are full-suspension bikes, but you can also find trail-oriented electric hardtails, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/canyon-grand-canyon-on/\">Canyon Grand Canyon:ON</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/kinesis-rise-hardtail-e-bike/\">Kinesis Rise</a>.</p>\n<h3>Electric mountain bike motors</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bosch's latest Performance CX motor on the Overvolt GLP2 full suspension mountain ebike\" title=\"Lapierre Overvolt GLP2 Team review 10\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bosch, Shimano and Yamaha motors are popular for electric mountain bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mathieu Echeverri / Lapierre</i></span></div>\n<p>Popular choices for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tech/best-electric-mountain-bike-motor/\">electric mountain bike motors</a> are Bosch, Shimano Steps and Yamaha, while Fazua’s lightweight motor is increasingly making an appearance on weight-focused bikes.</p>\n<p>Bosch Performance Line CX motors provide 600Wh peak power and 85Nm of torque for fuss-free climbing. There’s a natural ride feel and good battery management that gets impressive range out of the system’s battery.</p>\n<p>Shimano’s Steps E-8000 and E-7000 systems are still found on some eMTBs, although they’ve started to show their age, with lower power output and torque than newer rivals. Its smaller batteries give you less range too, but still boast low weight and a compact design, along with the ability to tune the output.</p>\n<p>However, Shimano has added the EP8 motor to its range. This boosts torque to 85Nm while reducing weight by around 200g, lowering pedalling drag, increasing range and lowering Q-Factor. The EP8’s launch coincided with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-du-ep800-motor/\">Shimano increasing battery capacity</a> to 630Wh. More and more, you’ll find it being specced on newer electric mountain bikes, including many of our picks above of the best electric mountain bikes.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Giant uses the Yamaha Syncdrive Pro motor on its e-MTBs. Its Smart Assist mode uses an array of six sensors, including a gradient sensor, to work out how much power to deliver in any given situation.</p>\n<p>A popular choice on road-going ebikes, the Fazua motor system is to be found on some lighter-weight e-MTBs, such as the Lapierre eZesty. It’s lighter, less powerful and has a smaller battery. That means you typically need to put in more of your own pedalling effort, but it drops the bike’s weight down closer to non-assisted models. Plus, you can remove the battery completely and ride the bike without it.</p>\n<p>Specialized has its own motor units, which it specs on the majority of its electric bikes. Its Turbo Levo SL trail bike uses the low-torque SL 1.1 motor and a 320Wh battery for less assistance and lighter weight.</p>\n<h3>Electric mountain bike battery capacity</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Turbo Levo SL range extender\" title=\"Specialized Turbo Levo SL range extender\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some bikes allow range to be extended with an additional battery.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>To get you up hills, produce enough power and provide adequate range, most electric mountain bikes will have battery capacities of around 500Wh to 700Wh.</p>\n<p>An internal battery in the down tube makes for clean lines, but there are also e-MTBs with external batteries. These typically lower the weight and, in models such as the Lapierre Overvolt, mean the battery can be placed lower and more centrally.</p>\n<p>But, as mentioned above, e-MTBs with smaller-capacity batteries down to 250Wh are appearing. These trade a more limited range for lighter weight and the potential for improved handling.</p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"e766982d2ba4287ee03bf8260d02a55dde4af1864b3969d9361af35a55849be0","category":"Cycling"}
