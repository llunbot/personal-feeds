Arriving in vehicles next year, the first cars to feature the new interface will be from Porsche and Aston Martin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a46188510/apple-carplay-next-gen-interface/&amp;xcust=1-1-2177439-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">reported by Car and Driver</a>, CarPlay will be customized for each of the cars. For example, the Porsche interface (seen below) features three gauges above the steering wheel and a “background wallpaper that mimics the brand’s distinct houndstooth (or Pepita in Porsche-speak) seat pattern.” The Aston Martin interface “includes a central information screen bookended by a circular speedometer and tachometer, the latter of which integrates “Handbuilt in Great Britain” wraparound text.”</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/next-gen-carplay-porsche.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Porsche's next-gen carplay interface\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/next-gen-carplay-porsche.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/next-gen-carplay-porsche.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/next-gen-carplay-porsche.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/next-gen-carplay-porsche.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/next-gen-carplay-porsche.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/next-gen-carplay-porsche.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/next-gen-carplay-porsche.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/next-gen-carplay-porsche.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Car and Driver didn’t share much in the way of information about the experience, but says it “requires an iPhone to share app-related information.” However the bulk of the system runs on the vehicle itself, so presumably Android users will be able to buy one, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aston Martin says the new system is “compatible with its latest infotainment system that launches in 2024,” including the DB12 coupe and Volante convertible, which start at $250,000. Porsche was mum on the models supported by next-gen CarPlay, but the first cars will presumably target the highest end of the market as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as Car and Driver notes, Porsche is owned by Volkswagen and Aston Martin has close ties with Mercedes, so next-gen CarPlay should make its way into more affordable cars soon enough.</p>\n\nApple Inc</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"dfd946522b5ff427375b54c3b78db9d0f44049f431aa129abf7874d508883e56","category":"Apple"}
