NASA has also brought back a former senior manager, Jim Free, to serve as a program leader.</p>\n<p>Lueders will lead one segment of the new office, the Space Operations Mission Directorate, and oversee operational programs such as the International Space Station and commercial crew programs. The other part of the reorganized office, with the unwieldy nameÂ Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, will manage development of the Artemis Moon program, including the Orion spacecraft, Space Launch System rocket, and Human Landing System. Free will serve as its chief.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795502#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795502&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5ceb47caefd011c242f4bf68c1571bc2179df7b38bcc18c99b4ea97e8c65e4a2","category":"Tech"}
