Apple silicon Macs and Intel Macs with a T2 security chip (2017-2020 models) have an \"Erase All Content and Settings\" option available in macOS Monterey and later. If you have an older pre-2017 Mac, it's a more convoluted process – <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/erase-and-factory-reset-your-mac/\">follow this link instead</a> to erase and factory reset your machine.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/spring-2022-possible-macs.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nTraditionally, wiping a Mac and returning it to factory settings involved manually signing out of a range of services, erasing your Mac's internal drive, then reinstalling macOS. These steps are quite involved when you consider how easy it is to wipe an iPhone or iPad (<strong>Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Transfer or Reset iPhone -&gt; Erase All Content and Settings</strong>).\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFortunately, Apple includes the same option on newer Macs running macOS Monterey and later. Erase All Content and Settings in macOS offers a very simple and straightforward way to erase your Mac without needing to reinstall the operating system. Thanks to the way storage is encrypted on Macs with Apple silicon or the T2 chip, the option is able to instantly and securely \"erase\" all user date by destroying the encryption keys.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNot only does this effectively erase all user data and user-installed apps from your Mac without reinstalling macOS, it also signs out your Apple Account from a range of services, removes any Touch ID fingerprints, purchases, and all Apple Wallet items, and turns off Find My and Activation Lock, making it far easier to restore your Mac to like-new factory settings.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe following steps show you how it's done. Whether you simply want to start fresh with your Mac or are planning to sell or gift your computer to another person, after erasing it using this option, your Mac will display the Setup Assistant and be ready to be set up like new.\r<br />\n<ol><li>Click the <strong>Apple () symbol</strong> in the menu bar and select <strong>System Settings</strong> (<strong>System Preferences...</strong> if you're not running macOS Ventura or later).</li>\r<br />\n<li>If you're running macOS Ventura or later, select <strong>General</strong> in the sidebar, then choose <strong>Transfer or Reset -&gt; Erase All Content and Settings...</strong>.
