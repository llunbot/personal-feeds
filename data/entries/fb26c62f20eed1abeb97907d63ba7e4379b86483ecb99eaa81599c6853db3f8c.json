But in 2025 the 4th generation carbon Lapierre Pulsium is ready to get back to racing as a lighter and more aerodynamic road bike with race-tuned geometry. While at the same time, still managing to deliver even better rider comfort to take on the longest days in the saddle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2025 Lapierre Pulsium carbon endurance all-road bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_up-close-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_up-close-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Lapierre Pulsium carbon endurance road bike, NDS\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_up-close-jpg.webp 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_up-close-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_up-close-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_up-close-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_up-close-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_up-close-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_up-close-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_up-close-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Lapierre)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lapierre says they can deliver both comfort AND performance, perfect for riders taking on their first gran fondo <em>and</em> for racers tackling longest ultra-distance events.

optimization is everywhere these days. And endurance road means longer times out, riding solo in the wind, even if at lower than pro racing speeds. So, Lapierre tweaked the new Pulsium to make it faster where they could.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Aero isn’t always everything, but it’s a performance factor that our engineers couldn’t neglect or set aside.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2025 Pulsium inherits aero headtube and fork leg shaping from the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/lapierre-xelius-drs-aero-road-bike-does-it-all-lightweight-comfort-race-ready-speed/\" target=\"_blank\">recent Xelius DRS</a> to smooth airflow over the front of the new endurance road bike. Lapierre says it makes this new bike “5% more aero” vs. the 2021 Pulsium. And that means a 6.1W savings at 50kph, or in real terms 4 seconds saved every 10km. Or still 2.1W savings at a more realistic 35kph speed, which actually means even more – 5 seconds saved every 10km.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_mountain-ride-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_mountain-ride-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Lapierre Pulsium carbon endurance road bike, riding solo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_mountain-ride-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_mountain-ride-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_mountain-ride-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_mountain-ride-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_mountain-ride-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_mountain-ride-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_mountain-ride-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Those marginal gains add up when you are out on the road longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>All-new race-ready geometry</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_group-ride-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_group-ride-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Lapierre Pulsium carbon endurance road bike, group ride\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_group-ride-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_group-ride-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_group-ride-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_group-ride-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_group-ride-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-carbon-endurance-road-bike_group-ride-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With more of a focus on speed, Lapierre also fine-tuned endurance geometry for a “sportier” feel, while keeping it “accessible to all amateur cyclists”.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-v4-lightweight-affordable-carbon-endurance-all-road-bike_geometry-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-v4-lightweight-affordable-carbon-endurance-all-road-bike_geometry-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Lapierre Pulsium carbon endurance road bike, updated geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-v4-lightweight-affordable-carbon-endurance-all-road-bike_geometry-jpg.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-v4-lightweight-affordable-carbon-endurance-all-road-bike_geometry-297x134.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-v4-lightweight-affordable-carbon-endurance-all-road-bike_geometry-1536x691.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-v4-lightweight-affordable-carbon-endurance-all-road-bike_geometry-120x54.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Lapierre-Pulsium-v4-lightweight-affordable-carbon-endurance-all-road-bike_geometry-768x346.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest shift was to decrease Stack between 9-19mm for riders looking for a lower, more aero fit on the bike. Plus, slightly longer Reach on the smaller sizes to limit toe overlap with big tires and improve stability. So, Stack:Reach ratios are a bit more aggressive but still in a neutral range.
