Didi the Devil</a></p>\n\n<p>Just two hours south of London, the weather couldn’t be more different. Admittedly I’ve flown here, but it’s incredible to think that the temperature in degrees on Portugal’s northwest coast is double that of home, and the idea it might rain preposterous. It’s why signing up for this late-season sportive was such a no-brainer – unlike the Low Countries or the High Alps you’re all but guaranteed a sun-shining time in Portugal, right through into winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s October now, but even December days are bright and clement. Still, fine weather is not enough on its own – the draw here is L’Étape Portugal, which promises 2,500m of climbing over 140km of roads rolling gently out of seaside town Viana do Castelo.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/france-pyrenees-cycling\">The Circle of Death: France Big Ride</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/haute-route-davos\">The high roads: Haute Route Davos sportive review</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gran-canaria-cycling\">Flight of the Canaries: Gran Canaria Big Ride</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Viana might not be on many UK cyclists’ bucket lists but what it lacks in reputation it more than makes up for in charm, cuisine and climate. As I wait in the start pen and tune in to the multilingual chatter, it appears that most of mainland Europe has cottoned on to these things too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a pistol crack that chatter is silenced, and as one mass we pedal off behind the commissaire’s car, winding through narrow streets and out towards the Puente Eiffel bridge. Just 2,499m of climbing to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Tour goes on tour</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Etape Portugal\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The Santuário de Santa Luzia sits above Viana do Castelo and marks the finale of the day’s ride. </figcaption><figcaption>Matt Grayson</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In the past few years more than 30 L’Étape events have spun off from the famous Tour de France sportive. You’ll recognise each by their name, ‘L’Étape <em>insert place name her</em>e by Tour de France’ – the suffix ever-present in official literature, just in case you should forget whose idea it was. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These sportives occur as far and wide as Cancun, Johor, Rotterdam and Las Vegas, yet while the original follows the route of a key mountain stage in each year’s Tour, these distant cousins make do with the best local terrain, a sprinkle of yellow bunting and the chance to see Tour fixture Didi the Devil. That guy must really be racking up the air miles.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Etape Portugal\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-03-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-03-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-03-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The local vineyards do fabulous work in creating Vinho Verde. </figcaption><figcaption>Matt Grayson</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The first three riders in any of these tertiary races win a trip to take part in L’Etape du Tour, while participation affords priority entry to the original French edition. Mercenary as this is, it makes L’Étape Portugal an ideal way into the notoriously oversubscribed French L’Étape. However, I didn’t come to Portugal to discuss France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hemmed in by Spain on one side and the Atlantic on the other, Portugal’s climate and culture is defined by its proximity to the sea. Viana do Castelo sits in the country’s populous north, and its location beside a major river, the Limia, helped it become a significant port.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-04-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Etape Portugal\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-04-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-04-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-04-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-04-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Matt Grayson</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Like in many such places, maritime jobs have declined in the face of globalisation, with tourism and sport coming to the economic rescue. Hence why the remnants of Viana’s fishing fleet still lands its catch beside the ride’s start line, but why this area is now more widely known for its sailing, rowing and surfing. So much so, in fact, that Viana do Castelo has been crowned European City of Sport for 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As our peloton glides along, I’m not surprised to find this is a pretty great place to ride a bike too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Climbs and chapels</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The morning is warm, my arm warmers are off, and although I’d earmarked this early part of the race as the least attractive stretch, it is nevertheless a dramatic improvement on the outskirts of most UK towns. The roads are wide and empty, with splendidly weathered pensioners clapping as our peloton passes by their homes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The yards outside the pensioners’ houses are invariably framed with vines, presumably ready to produce a home-brew version of the region’s famous Vinho Verde, a wine I became well-acquainted with last night. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Etape Portugal\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Heading for home with the sea hidden behind the day’s final climbs. </figcaption><figcaption>Matt Grayson</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As a result I’m a little fuzzy, yet despite engaging cruise mode to compensate for my overindulgence, it’s only a short time before the Limia Valley’s built-up areas are behind me. The greenery has become more abundant, the houses less frequent and the roads have turned from quiet to empty, except for us cyclists. But I’m surprised by one thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, when I hop off a plane and pull on my cycling shorts I want to cram in as much riding as possible, so with this in mind I’d assumed the full-length 140km version of L’Étape Portugal would be the most popular. Yet as I approach the route split it appears most riders are opting for the shorter 100km course. Perhaps the lure of an entire afternoon on the beach outshines the extra distance and the chance of winning a trip to France. Either way, I soon have far less company than I’d expected.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A welcome implication of my route choice soon greets me – the Aveleiras climb – which meanders gently from around sea level through cultivated terraces and up to an altitude a touch below 400m. At 5km and averaging 5.7%, it’s what might be called a civilised affair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adopting a pace best suited to appreciating my surroundings, I’m soon confronted by the handsome facade of the medieval Capela de São João Baptista da Comenda and, as if on cue, the tarmac beneath my tyres gives way to stone blocks to complete the medieval picture. It’s an unexpected combination of chapel and cobbles that wouldn’t feel out of place in the spring Classics.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Etape Portugal\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-06-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-06-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>No single ascent is too challenging in itself, but once you add them together you get 2,500m of elevation on the longest route.</figcaption><figcaption>Matt Grayson</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>I progress upwards, the scenery starting to break open as the asphalt makes its return. Looking down the valley I can almost see my way back to the sea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the top the cobbles reappear beside the Capela de Rio Frio, a chapel that marks the pinnacle of today’s climb and for the rest of the year serves as the focal point for the scattering of nearby houses and farms. Despite this, no residents are in attendance, leaving only cyclists to disturb the warm, dusty air.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pray for me</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The descent from Aveleiras is steeper than the way up, but sweeping and readily navigable at speed, and soon I’m deposited below the route profile’s most prominent hump. With 55km ticked off and still at a helpful couple of hundred metres of altitude, the next climb, Vascoes, doesn’t induce much nervousness. That said, with a peak of 600m it is still six times higher than the highest hill within riding distance of my house back home.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-07-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Etape Portugal\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-07-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-07-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-07-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-07-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-07-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-07-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-07-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-07.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Didi the Devil is, in fact, German. Nevertheless, he adds a manic dash of Tour de France style.</figcaption><figcaption>Matt Grayson</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Having grown tired of repeating my local loop I’m sorely out of practice, so despite its relatively mild slopes I make heavy going of Vascoes’ snaking road. The stretch that follows is near interminable, a ponderous 8km at 4.4%, and as I approach the summit the effort has led to some strange, thumping beat in my head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I finally make the top it transpires the organisers have deployed a troop of drummers to mark the day’s highest point. Without any other riders to stage a mock battle with for non-existent mountain points, I offer a bashful wave, painfully aware of my slow progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following 35km drop almost to sea level yet the going is rarely a free spin. The descent is peppered with short kicks, breaking up my rhythm and once again causing me to curse my lack of training. Happily for my legs there’s a festival going on in a small hamlet, so I decide it’s the perfect place for a rest stop.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-08-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Etape Portugal\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-08-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-08-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-08-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-08-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-08-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-08-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-08-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-08.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The medieval Capeloa de Sao Joao Baptista da Comenda and its accompanying cobbles mark the start of the climbing.</figcaption><figcaption>Matt Grayson</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As I’m filling my bottles a local parishioner comes over and invites me to church. It is Sunday, after all. In my broken Portuguese I thank her but politely decline the invitation, then get back on my bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Meeting with the devil</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Salvation deferred, I focus on the road ahead, which by now has lost most of its height to clip itself to the flanks of the Coura River as it flows to the coast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Down in the valley the flora has changed back from dusty to verdant and forested. The hillsides are too steep for houses; the road smooth and winding. It’s a soft and pleasant landscape made all the more lovely by the total lack of traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today’s route promised 2,500m of climbing but despite having swallowed most of it up without too much difficulty, a trio of late spikes remains for me to deal with. The first two, the Venade and Outeiro, are a touch over 200m and come just after the route detaches from the river and heads south to Viana. But before I can make the third and final crest, the course drops tantalisingly back into town and then swings cruelly away onto a winding cobbled track. Another mouthful of a place, the Byzantine-revivalist Santuário de Santa Luzia sanctuary awaits, and it’s here that I bump into the devil.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-09-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Etape Portugal\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-09-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-09-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-09-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-09-750x1124.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-09-1140x1708.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-09.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Riders pass through one of the many picturesque hamlets on the route.</figcaption><figcaption>Matt Grayson</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It’s decidedly late in the day for Didi, I’m sure – and I can only guess at his age – but credit to the man that when he sees me coming he leaps up into his trademark jumps, manic smile spread across his face, and treats me to a display as if I was leading a Tour-winning break. It’s all I need as a last morale boost, and a couple of hairpins later I’m over the finish line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even at my slow pace there’s still plenty of day left. From my vantage point I can see the hills behind me, the town spread out below and, just beyond that, the beach. Thanks to gravity, these last two won’t require any more pedalling to reach.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The details</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>There’s still time to sign up</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What: </strong>L’Étape Portugal<br /><strong>Where: </strong>Viana do Castelo, Portugal<br /><strong>How far: </strong>50km/100km/140km<br /><strong>Elevation: </strong>700m/1,600m/2,500m<br /><strong>Next one:</strong> 1st October 2023<br /><strong>Price<strong>:</strong> </strong>€40-€68 (£35-£50)<br /><strong>More info:</strong> <a href=\"https://portugal.letapebytourdefrance.com/\" target=\"_blank\">portugal.letapebytourdefrance.com</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The rider’s ride: Scott Addict RC 20</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-11-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Etape Portugal\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-11-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-11-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-11-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-11-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-11-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-11-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-11.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Matt Grayson</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Buy the more affordable Scott Addict RC 30 now from <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6821&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tredz.co.uk%2F.Scott-Addict-RC-30-2023-Road-Bike_260030.htm%3Fsku%3D934812\" target=\"_blank\">Tredz (£5,299)</a></strong></li><li><strong>Read our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/scott-addict-rc-ultimate-review\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Addict RC Ultimate review</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Scott Addict has existed in one form or another since 2007, and over the years it has evolved into an adept all-rounder. This <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-force-etap-axs-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM Force</a>-equipped version clocks in at a hair over 8kg and sports everything you’d expect for a platform in its third generation – cables are hidden, tubes are aero-optimised, cockpit is one piece and the wireless Force groupset has a huge gear range, with a 48/35 crankset and 10-33 cassette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to its sister bike, the Foil, the Addict is the less racy of Scott’s headline platforms. It’s still very stiff, however, and although the mid-section wheels provided are fine, a pair of deep sections would really unleash the bike’s drag-reducing potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Geometry is the more relaxed end of racy. With the supplied 28mm tyres the Addict is surprisingly comfortable and could be even more so, as Scott says the frameset has clearance for up to 32mm tyres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might not be a bargain, but it is an exceptionally good bike that’s perfectly suited to rides like this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we did it</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-10-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Etape Portugal\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-10-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-10-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/etape-portugal-10.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Drummers offer encouragement atop Vascoes, the day’s highest climb.</figcaption><figcaption>Matt Grayson</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Travel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to get to Viana do Castelo is to fly to Porto, then drive or take the train 75km north along the coast. Budget flights from the UK cost from £55 return, but overall it may actually be cheaper to fly with a premium airline that includes bikes as standard luggage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Accommodation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We stayed on the beach at the wonderful FeelViana Sport Hotel. With a pool and sauna, it’s an excellent spot for post-ride relaxing, and they rent bikes too – we hired the Scott Addict for €50 a day. FeelViana also has its own cycling club, bike shop and workshop, and for L’Étape Portugal puts on a seven-night deal that includes food, support, guiding and massage. Rooms from £160pn; L’Étape Portugal package €1,245 (£1,080) per person. Contact <a href=\"https://feelviana.com/en/home\" target=\"_blank\">feelviana.com</a> for more details.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Thanks </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Sofia and Ricardo at FeelViana for their excellent hosting and impeccable knowledge of riding in the local area. Much appreciation is also due to Antonio for our invitation to the event.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/etape-portugal-review\">L’Étape Portugal review: 140km with 2,500m climbing ft.
