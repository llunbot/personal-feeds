Now, \"Apple's patent portfolio is beginning to mirror the period prior to the Watch launch.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAhead of the Apple Watch's unveiling in 2014, Apple heavily patented the technology behind the device, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2014/07/22/apple-patent-smart-wristband/\">iPhone connectivity and sensors</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2014/03/13/ipod-nano-pedometer-iwatch/\">pedometer functionality and step detection</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2013/11/07/apple-patent-application-for-bluetooth-le-mediated-hotspot-functionality-sparks-iwatch-speculation/\">low-power Bluetooth</a>, and more. While <em>MacRumors</em> has been covering many of Apple's patents over a decade, there has been a noticeable uptick in patent filings <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2013/12/10/apples-work-on-video-goggles-highlighted-in-newly-granted-patent/\">related to head-mounted displays</a> in recent times.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/11/apple-mixed-reality-headset-revealed-patents/\">Apple's Work on Mixed Reality Headsets Revealed in New Patent Filings</a></li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor example, today, Apple was <a href=\"https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=55&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;p=2&amp;S1=(%22Apple+Inc%22.AANM.)&amp;OS=AANM/%22Apple+Inc%22&amp;RS=AANM/%22Apple+Inc%22\">granted a patent for wrist-based devices</a>, such as the Apple Watch, \"to produce a virtual representation of the hands or otherwise be used to receive and interpret gestures as user input\" in a head-mounted display.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMorgan Stanley highlighted that while Apple has faced difficulties with the development of its AR technology, the project is steadily nearing launch:<blockquote>The enormity of the technical challenge — compressing daylong battery, 5G, compute, cameras, lidar, projectors and wave guide lenses into a lightweight, attractive pair of glasses — is hard to overstate, but we are approaching liftoff.</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe note added that \"Apple's entry into the eyewear market will be the game changer for all participants as the technology gets normalized and popularized.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> believes Apple's \"mixed reality\" headset <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/07/kuo-apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022/\">will launch</a> in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/19/apple-ar-vr-headset-mass-production-delay/\">late 2022 to early 2023</a>, with a separate smart glasses device following between <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/21/apple-ar-vr-headset-2022-launch/\">2023</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/07/kuo-apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022/\">2025</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/\">Apple Glasses</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/morgan-stanley/\">Morgan Stanley</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-glasses-ar-and-vr.209\">Apple Glasses, AR and VR</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/16/apple-ar-headset-approaching-liftoff/\">Apple AR Headset 'Approaching Liftoff' as Development Mirrors Period Before Apple Watch Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ar-headset-approaching-liftoff-as-development-mirrors-period-before-apple-watch-launch.2323625/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0pfCVoQ0VNM:Dc2KZJnx1J4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0pfCVoQ0VNM:Dc2KZJnx1J4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3d8790b15d8c6826e0b9cf140f5fa2e65d84db817687fec28d1b00e74ed919c9","category":"Apple"}
