But as the price of wind and solar plunged, the arguments shifted. Suddenly, concerns about the waste left behind when solar panels hit end-of-life became so common that researchers at the US's National Renewable Energy Lab felt compelled to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-023-02230-0\">publish a commentary</a> in Nature Physics debunking them.</p>\n<p>Part of the misinformation is pure nonsense. The primary ingredients of most panels are silicon, aluminum, and silver, none of which is a major environmental threat. Solar panels also have a useful lifespan of decades, and the vast majority of those in existence are less than 10 years old, so waste hasn't even become much of a problem yet. And, even once these panels age out, recycling techniques are available.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the only realistic concern is that existing recycling technologies rely on nitric acid and can produce some toxic waste. But a group of researchers from Wuhan University have figured out an alternative means of recycling that avoids the production of toxic waste, and is more energy-efficient as a bonus.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028993#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028993&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f63641eb4cc8a00e9d575c4b2dc760b18df4136860de760d71af7a646344c3f1","category":"Tech"}
