For over a Martian year, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/04/listen-up-weve-detected-our-first-marsquake/\">we've had a seismograph on Mars</a> in the hope that it would help us figure out the red planet's interior.</p>\n<p>But Mars is relatively quiet seismically, and we only have a single seismograph instead of an entire network. Still, with records of a handful of significant marsquakes, we now have some sense of what Mars' interior looks like. And a set of new studies indicates that it's pretty weird, with a large, light core and an unexpectedly warm crust.</p>\n<h2>Itâ€™s complicated</h2>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1782724#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1782724&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d24f714a6e5026f79de092586468f3515770d4c556c7fdc991e8babf9988df37","category":"Tech"}
