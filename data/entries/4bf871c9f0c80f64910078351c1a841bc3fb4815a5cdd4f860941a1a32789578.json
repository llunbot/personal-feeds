And it is, but it isn’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wolf Tooth Drop-Stop B chainrings were introduced when SRAM introduced their road Flat Top chains. The tooth profile changed slightly, making the wide teeth slightly less wide so they fit in between the outer chain plates better with less rubbing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-sram-t-type-chainring-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1366\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-sram-t-type-chainring-1.jpg\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth mountain bike chainrings for sram transmission t-type flattop MTB chain\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-sram-t-type-chainring-1.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-sram-t-type-chainring-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-sram-t-type-chainring-1-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-sram-t-type-chainring-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-sram-t-type-chainring-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-sram-t-type-chainring-1-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-sram-t-type-chainring-1-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They also increased the roller pocket diameter for the Flat Top MTB chains, because those chains have slightly larger diameter rollers. This lets the chain fully drop in between the teeth, and keeps the roller resting on the load-bearing portion of the tooth rather than bottom out and not fully engaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, they’re adding mountain bike-sized Drop-Stop B chainrings with the SRAM 8-bolt direct mount pattern, which will have the proper 3mm and 0mm offsets…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which chainring offset do you need?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-sram-t-type-chainring-offset-chart-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1246\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-sram-t-type-chainring-offset-chart-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"wolf tooth 12-speed mountain bike chainring compatibility chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-sram-t-type-chainring-offset-chart-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-sram-t-type-chainring-offset-chart-297x145.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-sram-t-type-chainring-offset-chart-800x389.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-sram-t-type-chainring-offset-chart-120x58.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-sram-t-type-chainring-offset-chart-768x374.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-sram-t-type-chainring-offset-chart-1536x748.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-sram-t-type-chainring-offset-chart-2048x997.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM’s DUB WIDE spindles are what come with the new Transmission groups, which use a 3mm offset chainring to achieve a 55mm offset. For most riders, that means you’ll buy the 3mm offset chainring to match things up. But just in case you’re using a different crankset, use the chart above to check what you need…because there’s a narrower 52mm chainline XX SL spindle for racers that would use a 0mm offset to achieve the desired 55mm chainline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Confused yet? It’s not Wolf Tooth’s fault, it’s the way the bike industry has named the standard. The chain <em>LINE</em> offset is measured from the center line of the bike out to the chain line. The chain <em>RING</em> offset is actually a negative offset, bringing the chain line back in <em>closer</em> to the center line of the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What about other cranks?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-drop-stop-b-12sp-MTB-chainrings.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1183\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-drop-stop-b-12sp-MTB-chainrings.jpg\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Drop Stop B mountain bike chainrings for sram transmission t-type flattop MTB chain\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-drop-stop-b-12sp-MTB-chainrings.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-drop-stop-b-12sp-MTB-chainrings-297x176.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-drop-stop-b-12sp-MTB-chainrings-800x473.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-drop-stop-b-12sp-MTB-chainrings-120x71.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-drop-stop-b-12sp-MTB-chainrings-768x454.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wolf-tooth-drop-stop-b-12sp-MTB-chainrings-1536x909.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These new “B” chainrings are backward compatible and will eventually replace the Drop-Stop A versions, so you can just order Drop-Stop B chainrings for any 9, 10, 11, or 12-speed chain. The chainrings are machined from 7075-T6 aluminum and come with eight stainless steel bolts. Weights from 65g to 77g, prices from $79.95 to 84.95, available in 30/32/34/36 tooth counts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re also working on 104BCD and Race Face CINCH versions of the Drop-Stop B chainrings with the proper offsets and tooth counts for mountain bikes, so you’ll be able to run other cranksets with a SRAM Transmission group, including the original SRAM 3-bolt direct-mount cranks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/collections/mountain/products/direct-mount-chainrings-for-sram-8-bolt-mountain-cranks?utm_source=Klaviyo&amp;utm_medium=campaign&amp;utm_campaign=Consumer%20Facing%20SDM8%20Mountain%20Chainring%20Announcement&amp;_kx=Xsxg23mSucMAbNelJ91QtJGGapJtwfj3z57DUOTro_A%3D.UyKAxr\" target=\"_blank\">WolfToothComponents.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wolf-tooth-adds-sram-t-type-drop-stop-chainrings/\">Wolf Tooth adds SRAM T-Type Drop-Stop Chainrings</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"4bf871c9f0c80f64910078351c1a841bc3fb4815a5cdd4f860941a1a32789578","category":"Cycling"}
