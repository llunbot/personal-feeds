But now it’s no longer the preserve of the pro – HUUB can make anyone quicker. ‘We are proud to see that our years of R&amp;D, used initially to support the HUUB-Wattbike track team and Ribble-Weldtite Pro Cycling team, has now been able to filter into all our commercial products,’ says HUUB CEO Dean Jackson. ‘We’re making world-leading, cutting-edge aero technology available to everyone.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bridging the gap</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HUUB’s cycling products deliver a huge competitive advantage on any bike, across a wide range of speeds and conditions – whether it’s triathlon, track, road or time-trial. However, the game-changer is the brand’s Aero-Bridge<sup>TM</sup> Base Layer (£149.99), used in the decisive mountain time-trial stage of the 2023 Giro d’Italia and the most recent Olympics, where its competitive advantage led to raised voices as well as raised eyebrows.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"895\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/huub-sponsored-02-895x970.jpg\" alt=\"HUUB clothing\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/huub-sponsored-02-895x970.jpg 895w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/huub-sponsored-02-277x300.jpg 277w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/huub-sponsored-02-768x832.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/huub-sponsored-02-750x813.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/huub-sponsored-02-1140x1235.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/huub-sponsored-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>HUUB</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The base layer, also available in a short-sleeved version (£129.99) that can be worn underneath any smooth-sleeved cycle jersey, road speed suit or tri suit, was developed at the Silverstone Sports Engineering Hub and the Derby Velodrome alongside some of the world’s leading engineers and riders. Designed to be worn beneath a skinsuit, Aero-Bridge<sup>TM</sup> tech stretches the smooth fabric of the skinsuit over the base layer’s ridged arm fabric to disrupt airflow. Optimised for speeds of 45-55kmh, the kit has been supplied to national cycling teams competing at the highest level over the past two years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Skin in the game</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Given HUUB’s unparalleled success in triathlon, it’s no surprise that skinsuits rank highly on its cycling priorities. HUUB has worked with the greatest minds in aero and engineering to drive forward aero kit. More than 500 fabric tests went into the creation of the new Aero Road Speed Suit (£249.99) and, while working with Nottingham Trent University, HUUB has also better grasped how to regulate heat away from the body to reduce fatigue and boost overall performance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s even a Custom Labs skinsuit option. Prices start at £999 for team or club designs, with full custom sizing, design, fabrics and aero consultancy available from £2,500. Beyond suits, HUUB’s slip-on, weather-proof Anemoi Aero Overshoe (£39.99) promises aero gains for time-trials.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/huub-sponsored-03-728x970.jpg\" alt=\"HUUB clothing\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/huub-sponsored-03-728x970.jpg 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/huub-sponsored-03-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/huub-sponsored-03-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/huub-sponsored-03-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/huub-sponsored-03-750x1000.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/huub-sponsored-03-1140x1520.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/huub-sponsored-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>HUUB</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>HUUB’s JK9 collection of jerseys, bibshorts and speedsuit was created in partnership with Britain’s most decorated Olympian, Jason Kenny. ‘Pulling the data from our extensive aero fabric matrix, formulated over three years of wind-tunnel and fabric testing, we created a collection that is second to none,’ says Jackson. ‘We know speed matters for everyone, and Jason insisted we delivered a gain that was accessible at any speed.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>National treasure</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The performance advantage of HUUB’s products has been proven on the biggest stages. Take Ollie Wood, for example. Left without a team when AT85 Pro Cycling folded earlier this year – and therefore with the freedom to choose his own kit – the 27-year-old approached HUUB to help make him faster.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/HUUB-Laz_0032-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/HUUB-Laz_0032-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/HUUB-Laz_0032-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/HUUB-Laz_0032-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/HUUB-Laz_0032-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/HUUB-Laz_0032-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/HUUB-Laz_0032-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/HUUB-Laz_0032-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/HUUB-Laz_0032-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/HUUB-Laz_0032.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Ollie Wood wins the 2023 Circuit Race National Championships in June wearing a bespoke HUUB Custom Labs Skin Suit.</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Wood won the 2023 Circuit Race National Championships wearing his bespoke HUUB Custom Labs Skin Suit for the first time. HUUB Wattshop CC also had three riders in the top 10 of this year’s National TT Championships, with John Archibald, Dan Bigham and Michael Gill all using HUUB’s Aero-Bridge<sup>TM</sup> technology to beat many WorldTour pros. On the track meanwhile, HUUB-sponsored rider Neah Evans also picked up a new title and multiple medals at the National Championships.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fellowship of speed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind the success of HUUB’s phenomenally effective aero-optimised kit is a group affectionately referred to as the Fellowship of Speed. Combining the brains of people such as HUUB-Wattbike rider (and HUUB’s Head of Cycling) Jacob Tipper and Nottingham Trent University’s sports engineering and physiology expert, Dr Steve Faulkner, this R&amp;D team delivers results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘A lot of effort, money and resource goes into our research, and that often results in really small tweaks to kit,’ says Dr Faulkner. ‘But it’s those things that you don’t necessarily see that often make you go faster.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s always about marginal gains, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out more at <a href=\"https://huubdesign.com/\" target=\"_blank\">huubdesign.com</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/huub-cycling\">Resistance is futile</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"956ea3cfc38367c4cd3113a2094d692db0e321bac26e84a4aa77358ff4ec5bdc","category":"Cycling"}
