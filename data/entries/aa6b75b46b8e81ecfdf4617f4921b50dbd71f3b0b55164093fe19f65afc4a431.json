Without a large investment to redesign our towns and cities to make them walkable and accessible via public transport, switching en masse to electric cars is the main remaining avenue left to decarbonize our transport, after all. So it is rather encouraging to see signs that more US car buyers are opting to go electric, as sales have climbed 50 percent, year on year, as uptake reaches almost 8 percent.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coxautoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Q3-2023-Kelley-Blue-Book-Electric-Vehicle-Sales-Report.pdf\">According to Kelly Blue Book</a>, US car buyers bought 313,086 battery EVs between the months of July and September 2023, compared to just 209,030 BEVs for the same three months of last year. Add in the 882 Toyota Mirai hydrogen fuel cell EVs and 68 Hyundai Nexo FCEVs that found homes in Q3 2023 and that's a 50.1 percent increase, year on year.</p>\n<p>The cumulative totals for all of 2023 so far are also looking healthy. KBB estimates that 873,082 BEVs have been bought this year, versus 586,965 for the first nine months of 2022. Add in about 2,800 FCEVs compared to around 1,000 last year, and clean vehicle sales grew 49 percent, year on year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976498#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976498&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
