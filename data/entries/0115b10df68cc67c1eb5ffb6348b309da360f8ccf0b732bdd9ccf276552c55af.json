The developers behind the project have not posted a regular progress report update <a href=\"https://blog.ryujinx.org/progress-report-january-2024/\">since January</a> after posting similar updates <a href=\"https://blog.ryujinx.org/\">almost every month throughout 2023</a>. Before today, the Ryujinx social media account last posted an announcement <a href=\"https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1763916049647382644\">in March</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053765#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053765&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0115b10df68cc67c1eb5ffb6348b309da360f8ccf0b732bdd9ccf276552c55af","category":"Tech"}
