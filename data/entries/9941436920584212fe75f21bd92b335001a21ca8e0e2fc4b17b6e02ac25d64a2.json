The headset is in new condition and it comes with a one year Apple manufacturer limited warranty.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band-Teal-Feature-2.jpg\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Woot.

Woot's product listing does not offer a selection of sizes and does not specify what sizes of light seal and head bands are included, so it is unclear what customers will receive with their orders.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-462641-13142092?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-mql83ll-a-vision-pro-256gb%3Fref%3Dcnt_wp_0_1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$150 OFF</div>Apple Vision Pro for $3,349.00</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDespite the murkiness with the sizes, Woot's discount today is notable as the very first sale we've ever seen from any major retailer for the Apple Vision Pro, which launched back in February. Woot says that this sale will last until it sells out, and there's an estimated delivery date between April 8 and April 10.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOur full <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Deals Roundup</a> has more information on the latest Apple-related sales and bargains.\r<br />\n<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/apple-vision-pro-first-discount/\">Apple Vision Pro Gets First Discount ($150 Off) at Woot, But There's a Catch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-gets-first-discount-150-off-at-woot-but-theres-a-catch.2422940/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Mitchel Broussard","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9941436920584212fe75f21bd92b335001a21ca8e0e2fc4b17b6e02ac25d64a2","category":"Apple"}
