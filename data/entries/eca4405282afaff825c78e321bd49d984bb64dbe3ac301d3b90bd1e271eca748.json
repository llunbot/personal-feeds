Since <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/oled-monitor-selection-is-pathetic-2023-can-change-that/\">OLED monitor selection</a> only started significantly improving over the last couple of years, long-term usage is minimal. Further, new types of OLED monitor technologies, like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/01/explaining-qd-oled-samsungs-display-tech-thats-wowing-ces/#:~:text=QD%2DOLED%20stands%20for%20%22quantum,started%20mass%20production%20in%20November.\">QD-OLED</a>, are still evolving.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1985846#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1985846&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"eca4405282afaff825c78e321bd49d984bb64dbe3ac301d3b90bd1e271eca748","category":"Tech"}
