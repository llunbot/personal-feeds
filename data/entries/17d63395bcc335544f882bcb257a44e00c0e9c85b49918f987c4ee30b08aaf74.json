It is unclear if Apple is still planning to host a Mac-focused event later this month, but it seems that an iPad 11 will not be announced this month regardless.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple released the iPad 10 in October 2022, and it features a 10.9-inch display and an A14 Bionic chip. It is unclear when the iPad 11 will be released given these recent developments, but 2025 at the earliest seems like a safe bet at this point.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/16/ipad-11-now-seems-unlikely-this-year/\">iPad 11 Now Seems Unlikely to Launch This Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-11-now-seems-unlikely-to-launch-this-year.2440256/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"17d63395bcc335544f882bcb257a44e00c0e9c85b49918f987c4ee30b08aaf74","category":"Apple"}
