The AP interviewed more than 12 software engineers, developers, and researchers who found the model regularly invents text that speakers never said, a phenomenon often called a \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/\">confabulation</a>\" or \"hallucination\" in the AI field.</p>\n<p>Upon its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/new-ai-model-from-openai-automatically-recognizes-speech-and-translates-to-english/\">release</a> in 2022, OpenAI claimed that Whisper approached \"human level robustness\" in audio transcription accuracy. However, a University of Michigan researcher told the AP that Whisper created false text in 80 percent of public meeting transcripts examined. Another developer, unnamed in the AP report, claimed to have found invented content in almost all of his 26,000 test transcriptions.</p>\n<p>The fabrications pose particular risks in health care settings. Despite OpenAI's warnings against using Whisper for \"<a href=\"https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/openai-whisper-large/version/17/registry/azureml?lang=fr?wtime=%7Bseek_to_second_number%7D\">high-risk domains</a>,\" over 30,000 medical workers now use Whisper-based tools to transcribe patient visits, according to the AP report. The Mankato Clinic in Minnesota and Children's Hospital Los Angeles count among 40 health systems using a Whisper-powered AI copilot service from medical tech company <a href=\"https://www.nabla.com/\">Nabla</a> that is fine-tuned on medical terminology.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/hospitals-adopt-error-prone-ai-transcription-tools-despite-warnings/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/hospitals-adopt-error-prone-ai-transcription-tools-despite-warnings/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"88557cd14559fab67fc0c69a580f27e0fda69634007fa34e317ba0873004f1df","category":"Tech"}
