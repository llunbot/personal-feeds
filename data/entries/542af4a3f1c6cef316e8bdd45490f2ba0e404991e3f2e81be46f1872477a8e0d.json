Executive Producer Kathleen Kennedy (who co-produced <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goonies\"><em>The Goonies</em></a>) has publicly confirmed as much. The latest trailer really leans into that influence: The series feels like something not created specifically for kids, but rather telling a story that just happens to be about kids going on an adventure.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/08/jude-laws-jedi-befriends-kids-lost-in-space-in-star-wars-skeleton-crew-trailer/\">previously reported</a>, the eight-episode standalone series is set in the same timeframe as <em>The Mandalorian</em> and <em>Ahsoka</em>. Per the official premise:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Skeleton Crew</em> follows the journey of four kids who make a mysterious discovery on their seemingly safe home planet, then get lost in a strange and dangerous galaxy, crossing paths with the likes of Jod Na Nawood, the mysterious character played by [Jude] Law. Finding their way home—and meeting unlikely allies and enemies—will be a greater adventure than they ever imagined.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jude Law leads the cast as the quick-witted and charming (per Law) \"Force-user\" Jod Na Nawood. Ravi Cabot-Conyers plays Wim, Ryan Kiera Armstrong plays Fern, Kyriana Kratter plays KB, and Robert Timothy Smith plays Neil. Nick Frost will voice a droid named SM 33, the first mate of a spaceship called the <em>Onyx Cylinder</em>. The cast also includes Fred Tatasciore as Brutus, Jaleel White as Gunther, Mike Estes as Pax, Marti Matulis as Vane, and Dale Soules as Chaelt. Tunde Adebimpe and Kerry Condon will appear in as-yet-undisclosed roles.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/11/new-skeleton-crew-trailer-really-channels-the-goonies/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/11/new-skeleton-crew-trailer-really-channels-the-goonies/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"542af4a3f1c6cef316e8bdd45490f2ba0e404991e3f2e81be46f1872477a8e0d","category":"Tech"}
