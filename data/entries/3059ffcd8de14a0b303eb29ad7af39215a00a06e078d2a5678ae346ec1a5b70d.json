Its full line-up of live and non-live cycling coverage will move to TNT Sports, available through the Discovery+ streaming service as part of a premium package costing £30.99 a month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The switch to TNT Sports only applies to the UK; Eurosport will continue to broadcast in more than 50 territories across Europe. As of 2026, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/itv-tour-de-france-2025\" target=\"_blank\">live coverage of the Tour de France will end on ITV</a>, making TNT Sports the exclusive source for live cycling coverage in the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the races currently shown on Eurosport in the UK will be shown on TNT Sports, including all three men’s and women’s Grand Tours, UCI World Championships, all the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\" target=\"_blank\">Monuments and one-day Classics</a>, UCI Mountain Bike World Series, complete cyclocross and track season, as well as another 70+ men’s and women’s road races. This equates to over 1,000 hours of live racing and the broadcasting of 100% of the men’s and women’s WorldTour for the first time ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The premium TNT Sports package will also include Premier League football, Premiership rugby, MotoGP, international cricket, Australian Open and Roland-Garros tennis, the Olympics, UFC, boxing, snooker and a host of other sports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas Discovery+ currently offers a ‘standard’ package that includes the cycling – but not most of the other major sports – for £6.99 a month, as of 28th February cycling will only be available as part of the premium package at £30.99 a month (£371.88 a year).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott Young, group SVP content, production &amp; business operations for Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) Sports Europe, says, ‘Combining Eurosport and TNT Sports content in the UK and Ireland will enable us to offer a single, premium viewing experience for sports fans.’</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>The Ultimate Cycling Show</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/orla-chennaoui-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/orla-chennaoui-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/orla-chennaoui-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/orla-chennaoui-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/orla-chennaoui-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/orla-chennaoui-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/orla-chennaoui-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/orla-chennaoui-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/orla-chennaoui-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/orla-chennaoui-1.jpg 1294w\" /><figcaption>Wesley Verhoeve</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>TNT Sports’ cycling coverage will continue to be hosted by Eurosport’s regular presenters and commentators, including <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/orla-chennaoui-interview\">Orla Chennaoui</a>, Adam Blythe and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-biggest-problem-in-our-business-is-ego-rob-hatch-qa\" target=\"_blank\">Rob Hatch</a>. As well as the usual live commentary and pre- and post-race analysis, Chennaoui and Blythe will host a weekly cycling magazine show called <em>The Ultimate Cycling Show</em>, which will be free-to-air on <a href=\"https://www.questtv.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Quest</a> channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quest is part of the WBD family and is free to watch through TV packages such as Sky, Virgin or Freeview. <em>The Ultimate Cycling Show </em>will air every Thursday from 27th February until the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia</a>, when it will take a break and then return after the race finishes until the start of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a> in July.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WBD says this is part of its commitment to provide some free-to-air content with a view to growing the cycling audience in the UK. The format will allow the presenters to discuss the topics and issues around pro racing in a way that isn’t possible during standard race commentary owing to lack of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+4\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-4-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-4-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-4-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-4-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-4-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-4-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-4-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-4-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘That’s the problem with the show we do [post-race analysis show <em>The Breakaway</em>],’ says Blythe. ‘There’s a limit to how much you can actually talk about when you do a stage. There are so many stories. This [<em>The Ultimate Cycling Show</em>] gives us a better chance to explain cycling.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chennaoui adds, ‘You only get to touch on a story [on <em>The Breakaway</em>] before you’ve got to move on quickly. With this it allows us to deconstruct the sport in a way that that reminds me why I found it fascinating to begin with. And we’ll be able to have more fun with the topics and be a bit less filtered with it because we won’t have to rush on to the next thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s like the crossover point between traditional television coverage and what you might see on YouTube. It’s injecting more fun, spontaneity, unpredictability into a magazine show every week.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When pressed on whether the lack of free-to-air live racing on linear TV will limit the number of new fans coming to the sport, Hatch replies, ‘Society has changed. Kids don’t watch telly. They watch YouTube.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/itv-tour-de-france-2025\">ITV to lose Tour de France broadcast rights after 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/gcn-plus-closing-down\">GCN+ and its app to close in December 2023</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/orla-chennaoui-interview\">Up front: Orla Chennaoui profile</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\">Cycling Spring Classics 2025: Race dates, Monuments, cobbles and live TV guide</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>TNT Sports plans to provide race highlights packages and other related content free through social media such as YouTube, TikTok and Instagram.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hatch continues, ‘The algorithms will push people to TNT Sport cycling. We’ll captivate people with interviews, with the chemistry between these two [Chennaoui and Blythe], I’ll do the Grupetto [Hatch’s YouTube show] every week, we’ll be telling people what’s on… that’s the way we’ll get new people to the sport.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chennaoui adds, ‘Our online interaction with the audience is something that we take really seriously, even if it looks like we’re being frivolous. We want to showcase a bit of personality so that people on social media say, “They’re having fun. What’s that about? They’re talking about cycling; I don’t get why that seems to be such fun.” And we bring them in that way. I see it with my kids – that’s how they stumble on something new.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, the aim of the free-to-air content will be to push people towards subscribing to the TNT Sports premium package. However Chennaoui points out that, while the cost may be high, the survival of the sport requires the investment that the likes of WBD can provide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We want investment in the sport. We might want it free-to-air but without investment where does the sport go? Besides, if you’re a cycling fan, I think you want to see it alongside football and rugby and the big sports in this country. That’s where cycling belongs.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/eurosport-tnt-sports-premium\">Live cycling moves to TNT Sports premium subscription</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"3059ffcd8de14a0b303eb29ad7af39215a00a06e078d2a5678ae346ec1a5b70d","category":"Cycling"}
