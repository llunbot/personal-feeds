The following year they partnered with Silca to 3D print a complete stem to give them a unique stealth cockpit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, they needed a top-shelf bike to showcase such things, and that’s where the Great Divide comes in. It’s a boutique titanium road bike with their signature polished-and-brushed finish, with your choice of anodized finishes. I stuck with the natural titanium finish with a dark gray belly for my test bike, and the geometry was their stock size 58, but you can go full custom if you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of what geo you want, each one is built to order, so that’s where we’ll start…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-weights-2-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-weights-2-jpg.webp\" alt=\"production tag for No 22 great divide titanium road bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-weights-2-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-weights-2-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-weights-2-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-weights-2-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-weights-2-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Every No.22 bike that rolls out of their New York HQ is handmade, one at a time, based on your specs and requested add-ons. They offer seven stock sizes, or you can send your bike fit data for a custom build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every person who touches the frame signs off on their work, a process that not only maintains accountability but illustrates the number of craftspersons involved (it’s not just crafts<em>men</em>, their best anodizer and others on the team are women, too). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-features-2-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-features-2-jpg.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of No 22 great divide titanium road bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-features-2-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-features-2-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-features-2-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-features-2-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-features-2-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The most striking element of the bike is the stem, but not just on its own…it’s the how it hides all of the wires and hoses and creates a perfectly seamless cockpit. That it’s smooth but so obviously metal (and especially when it’s anodized in colors to match the frame) makes it even more of a conversation starter.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-features-3-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-features-3-jpg.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of No 22 great divide titanium road bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-features-3-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-features-3-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-features-3-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-features-3-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-features-3-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Shape-matched interlocking spacers make bike fit easy and don’t require any brake hose disconnects.

If I’m being honest, I wouldn’t want to have to build this bike from scratch (and I didn’t), but damn if it doesn’t look amazing. I expect stealth routing to look good on carbon bikes, but there is something about this bike that just makes it seem more special.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Small touches abound that show No.22’s attention to detail.

No.22 offers this fork to others, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All main tubes are custom butted to tune ride quality and make it lighter.

So it’s something for a builder to be able to elevate that, and I think No.22 does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be fair, I initially had some…uh…feelings about the 3D-printed stem. Not skeptical, and not scared. But maybe…cautiously optimistic. There’s something about the notion of a bunch of metal powder being magically turned into a part that directly connects the two things (fork and handlebar) that take the brunt of the forces at the front end of the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I started slow and worked up to more stresses and rougher surfaces. In the end, it was perfect, and clearly contributed to the front end’s excellent lateral stiffness. Standing and cranking on the bars yielded nothing but dramatically firm swaying of the bike beneath me.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-ride-review-15-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-ride-review-15-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist riding the No 22 great divide titanium road bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-ride-review-15-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-ride-review-15-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-ride-review-15-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-ride-review-15-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-ride-review-15-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That lateral and torsional stiffness also helped the bike carve corners and stick to its lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-ride-review-6-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-ride-review-6-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist riding the No 22 great divide titanium road bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-ride-review-6-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-ride-review-6-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-ride-review-6-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-ride-review-6-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/No22-great-divide-ti-road-bike-ride-review-6-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And it sends power backward rather efficiently.
