But now at Eurobike, the new Ruut CF carbon bike has been brought out from under cover for a closer look. And its more conventional aluminum Ruut AL sibling has been unveiled too, with its own bit of unique design features…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unmistakable novelty of the new second-generation Rondo Ruut is that interrupted seat tube design, which replaces the conventional and traditionally-structural two-triangle design that we all know and love for its simplicity. Rondo had already put a couple kinks in those triangles since <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bfs2017-rondo-ruut-adjustable-geometry-fat-gravel-bikes-eu-upstart-carbon-alloy-steel/\" target=\"_blank\">the first iteration of their carbon gravel bike</a>, but in more recent years they’ve gotten even more adventurous with <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=rondo\" target=\"_blank\">angular, unconventional shapes</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rondo Ruut CF 2nd-gen carbon gravel bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_CF0-CF1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_CF0-CF1.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rondo Ruut v2 all-new unique gravel bike with adjustable geometry in carbon or aluminum, CF0 &amp; CF1\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_CF0-CF1.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_CF0-CF1-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_CF0-CF1-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_CF0-CF1-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_CF0-CF1-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_CF0-CF1-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>Rondo Ruut CF0 (<em>back</em>) &amp; CF1 (<em>front</em>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While this broken seat tube promises to “tremendously” boost rider comfort thanks to controlled vertical flex – the same basic premise we saw in a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/next-gen-specialized-angled-strut-vertical-compliance-patent/\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized patent</a> the day before our Ruut 2.0 sneak peek, and then their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2023-specialized-sirrus-carbon-struts-its-stuff-for-comfort-on-the-commute/\" target=\"_blank\">Sirrus</a> commuter bike – Rondo also has used the unconventional design as a springboard for even more wild shaping throughout the front half of their new carbon gravel bike. As their product designer explained it to me… “it also looks cool”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We already knew plenty of details this year about the more integrated carbon bike with its carry-over adjustable geometry thanks to the fork axle flip-chips and five frame sizes (XS-XL), fully internal cables, nowhere to mount a front derailleur, a deeply aero fork that shields the front disc caliper, an asymmetric T47 BB &amp; round 27.2mm seatpost. We also now know that at least three builds will be made available later this year, all with SRAM AXS wireless gravel drivetrains &amp; Hunt wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top Rondo Ruut CF0 (<em>green above</em>) will get a Force XPLR group &amp; special Rondo crossover branded Hunt Limitless aero carbon gravel wheels. Then, a Ruut CF1 will get Rival XPLR with Rondo+Hunt X-Wide alloy gravel wheels. While tire clearance for the bike is set at a max 45mm for 700c or 50mm for 650b, both of these get 700c wheels wrapped in racy 40mm gravel tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_CF-X-complete.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_CF-X-complete.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rondo Ruut v2 all-new unique gravel bike with adjustable geometry in carbon or aluminum, CF X complete\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_CF-X-complete.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_CF-X-complete-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_CF-X-complete-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_CF-X-complete-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_CF-X-complete-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_CF-X-complete-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>Rondo Ruut CF X</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, Rondo will make another cyclocross race spec of their gravel bike.

Geometry and TwinTip fork flip-chip adjustability are the same. And Rondo also made a few odd design decisions, just to make it “look cool”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alloy gravel bike sticks with more conventional modern frame tube shaping, slightly dropping its seatstays for comfort, hydroforming top &amp; down tubes for stiffness &amp; aero gains, and dropping both chainstays for big tire clearance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_AL1-asymmetric-fork.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_AL1-asymmetric-fork.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rondo Ruut v2 all-new unique gravel bike with adjustable geometry in carbon or aluminum, asymmetric fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_AL1-asymmetric-fork.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_AL1-asymmetric-fork-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_AL1-asymmetric-fork-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_AL1-asymmetric-fork-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_AL1-asymmetric-fork-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_AL1-asymmetric-fork-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_AL1-asymmetric-fork-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ruut AL also gets fully internal cables routed through the headset, but this bike retains front derailleur compatibility (especially important for lower-cost GRX builds). It also gets more mounts all around – 2 standard cages in the front triangle, toptube bag &amp; under downtube mounts, plus rear rack mounts, fender mounts, and anything cage mounts on each leg of the fork.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That new Ruut G3 carbon fork is also quite interesting. From the side, it looks to share the narrower taper, swept forward profile of current Ruut forks, but is curiously asymmetric from the front.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rondo’s designer said that’s ‘just because’. The asymmetry at the crown made it a little simpler and cleaner to locate a grommet for internal dynamo wiring routing to exit heading to a headlight either high up under the bar or lower over the front tire. But really, it was just a fun design choice to make it look different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_behind-teh-AL1-chainring.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_behind-teh-AL1-chainring.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rondo Ruut v2 all-new unique gravel bike with adjustable geometry in carbon or aluminum, what's under there?\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_behind-teh-AL1-chainring.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_behind-teh-AL1-chainring-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_behind-teh-AL1-chainring-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_behind-teh-AL1-chainring-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_behind-teh-AL1-chainring-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking down lower on the frame – under a PF86 bottom bracket – we noticed some clean semi-internal cable routing for the rear derailleur through a machined chainstay yoke, but also something else poking out below… </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rondo has given the Ruut AL a little integrated toolbox under the bottom bracket.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_AL1-toolbox-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_AL1-toolbox-detail.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Rondo Ruut v2 all-new unique gravel bike with adjustable geometry in carbon or aluminum, AL1 internal toolbox\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_AL1-toolbox-detail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_AL1-toolbox-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_AL1-toolbox-detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_AL1-toolbox-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_AL1-toolbox-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_AL1-toolbox-detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2024-Rondo-Ruut-v2-unique-adaptable-gravel-bike-in-carbon-or-aluminum_AL1-toolbox-detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A plastic insert that bolts onto the open bottom of the aluminum downtube &amp; bottom bracket houses a good-sized multi-tool and a separate chain breaker that both come with the bike you buy.

But we’re still waiting for word on official pricing and model availability timing. The bike rumor has it that they are realistically more of a model year 2024 bike, rather than MY23 as we originally thought. But with that said, we are still expecting them to be available sometime this autumn, and hopefully will get on one for some test rides soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://rondo.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">Rondo.cc</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rondo-gives-closer-look-at-new-ruut-2-0-gravel-bikes-unique-in-either-carbon-or-alloy/\">Rondo Gives Closer Look at New Ruut 2.0 Gravel Bikes, Unique in Either Carbon or Alloy</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ad67cf364a2e728fdd11db3bc7b5dc61268807b5f3f9e9ac66bd592e6b404b9e","category":"Cycling"}
