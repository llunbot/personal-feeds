{"title":"iOS 18 and macOS 15 to Feature Refreshed Settings App","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/ios-18-refreshed-settings-app/","date":1717186925000,"content":"With the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/\">macOS 15</a> updates, Apple plans to streamline the Settings app, <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1796399911526920509\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> confirmed today. He said that while it's not a \"huge deal,\" there are some changes planned.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-18-WWDC-24-Feature-1.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe Settings app on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> and the System Settings on Macs will get an updated UI with a \"reorganized, cleaner layout\" that's simpler to navigate. Search in the Settings app is also set to improve, and that's been a major issue with prior versions of iOS and macOS.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn iOS specifically, searching for an option in the Settings app often returns no results or the wrong result. A search for \"Charging Optimization,\" a setting on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, does not bring up the interface, for example. There are several other smaller settings options that are similarly inaccessible when searching.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPart of the changes planned for ‌iOS 18‌ and ‌macOS 15‌ include major updates to Spotlight and search throughout the operating systems, as well as an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/30/ai-siri-features-ios-18-2025/\">overhauled version of Siri</a> that is able to control all individual features in apps. Combined, these updates should make it easier to get to some of the more hidden settings on Apple devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA prior rumor suggested that Apple would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/macos-15-system-settings-design/\">overhaul the macOS System Settings app</a>, introducing rearranged menus and app UIs in an update that will be the biggest since the Settings app was refreshed in macOS Ventura. On the Mac, Apple is said to be using an organizational system focused on \"priority and overall importance,\" and the same changes could be made on iOS as well.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Notifications and Sound categories in System Settings will be moved lower in the list, with General settings moved up under Network settings. Wallpaper and Displays will join General settings, and Privacy and Security will be paired with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> and Password.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is also planning to refresh <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/ios-18-control-center-updates-rumor/\">the Control Center</a> on ‌iOS 18‌ and Apple has been testing the changes internally, but specific updates are unclear at this time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMore on the features that are coming to iOS and macOS can be found in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/\">macOS 15</a> roundups, which are updated regularly with all of the new rumors that we've heard.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference keynote is set to take place on Monday, June 10, with Apple unveiling ‌iOS 18‌, ‌macOS 15‌, and also iPadOS 18, tvOS 18, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a> 2, and watchOS 11.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/\">macOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/ios-18-refreshed-settings-app/\">iOS 18 and macOS 15 to Feature Refreshed Settings App</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-and-macos-15-to-feature-refreshed-settings-app.2427850/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"35e7b83d6b78222a0d3799cdb7e4d1315f144020b73191484f68f9128a33b554","category":"Apple"}
