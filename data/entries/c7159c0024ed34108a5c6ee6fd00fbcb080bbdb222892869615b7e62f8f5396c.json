The same team also built two soft robotic turtles (the terrapin turtle is UMD's official mascot) using the same multimaterial 3D-printing process that produced the robotic hand.</p>\n<p>We traditionally think of robots as being manufactured out of hard, rigid materials, but the subfield of soft robotics takes a different approach. It seeks to build robotic devices out of more flexible materials that mimic the properties of those found in living animals. There are huge advantages to be gained by making the entire body of a robot out of soft materials, such as being flexible enough to squeeze through tight spaces to hunt for survivors after a disaster. Soft robots also hold strong potential as prosthetics or biomedical devices. Even rigid robots rely on some soft components, such as foot pads that serve as shock absorbers or flexible springs to store and release energy.</p>\n<p>Harvard researchers built an <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19100\">octopus-inspired soft robot in 2016</a> that was constructed entirely out of flexible materials. But soft robots are more difficult to control precisely because they are so flexible. In the case of the \"octobot,\" the researchers replaced the rigid electronic circuits with microfluidic circuits. Such circuits involve regulating the flow of water (hydraulics) or air (pneumatics), rather than electricity, through the circuit's microchannels, enabling the robot to bend and move.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1782874#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1782874&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c7159c0024ed34108a5c6ee6fd00fbcb080bbdb222892869615b7e62f8f5396c","category":"Tech"}
