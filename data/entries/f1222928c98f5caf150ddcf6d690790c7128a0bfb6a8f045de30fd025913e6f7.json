Not so much. But I enjoyed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters_(2016_film)\">2016 all-female film</a> (especially the extended cut, which let the cast cut loose a bit more), and I am not one of those overly nostalgic sorts who fetishize the films of my youth. So I was truly rooting for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/new-ghostbusters-afterlife-trailer-teases-return-of-lots-of-familiar-faces/\"><em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em></a>. The trailers were promising, the casting was spot-on, and I loved the kid-centric premise of a new generation picking up the ghostbusting mantle of Bill Murray and the original gang.</p>\n<p>There's much to like about this sequel from Jason Reitman (son of Ivan Reitman, who directed the first two films): great performances, nimble direction, and some humorous callbacks to the original beloved film. Unfortunately, all of that sinks under the weight of a clunky script and a tired, predictable plot that takes the fan service to downright treacly levels.</p>\n<p><strong>(Major spoilers below the gallery.
