Basically I need surgery if I don’t want a bung shoulder for life.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CSq4GtfsoYH/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div> View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CSq4GtfsoYH/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Grace Brown (@_g_brown)</a></p></div></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this month FDJ Nouvelle-Aquitaine Futuroscope announced Brown would join the French outfit next season on a two-year deal. As such, the Giro Donne – where Brown crashed on stage 8 – was the 29-year-old’s last race in BikeExchange colours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m sad about all the good things I will miss, especially my final races with [BikeExchange] and the Flanders World Championships,” Brown wrote. “But I also need to remember that I’ve had such a good year up to this point, and I can be satisfied with that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown’s season started with silver medals in both the road race and time trial at the Australian Road Nationals. She finished second at Danilith Nokere Koerse, won Brugge-De Panne in late March – her first WorldTour victory – and then won a stage of the Vuelta a Burgos. In a season that included 14 top-10 finishes, Brown took third at the Tour of Flanders, likewise in the individual time trial at the Giro Donne, and finished fifth at La Course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More recently Brown represented Australia at the Tokyo Olympics where she finished fourth in the time trial, just seven seconds off the bronze medal.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CR3qZfIMX3z/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div> View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CR3qZfIMX3z/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Grace Brown (@_g_brown)</a></p></div></blockquote> \n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/grace-browns-season-is-over/\">Read More</a>","author":"Matt de Neef","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"6e9593dbcaff4deaf0058e309b6e29b631d064dbed2e665b36abd0b151f8b552","category":"Cycling"}
