{"title":"Tim Cook Pep-Talks Himself","link":"https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1881310716226916777","date":1737391538000,"content":"\n<p>Tim Cook on X:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dr. King once said, “Everybody can be great, because everybody can\nserve.” True greatness lies in lifting others, making a\ndifference, and serving with purpose. Let’s honor his legacy by\nfinding ways to serve and create a better world together.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Curious to see if that’s Cook’s only tweet of the day, or if a <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/i_wonder\">congratulatory one</a> is forthcoming, after Trump’s oath of office at noon.</p>\n\n<p>Apple has been dedicating its homepage to MLK on his holiday <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/search/?s=martin+luther+king+jr\">for at least 10 years</a>, so <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/apple-homepage-mlk\">today</a> isn’t some exception just because it’s also Inauguration Day. But it’s perhaps pointing out that no one else among Apple’s corporate peers is doing this. The homepages of (in market cap order), Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla make no mention of either MLK <em>or</em> Trump’s inauguration. Just another day on the calendar for all of them. But I’m not sure any of those companies ever tend to celebrate holidays on their company homepages.</p>\n\n<p>But the one company that is famous for its holiday “doodles” is Google. And <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/google.com-mlk-2025.pdf\">Google’s homepage today</a> makes no mention today of MLK, but does direct visitors’ attention to their hosted livestream of Trump’s inauguration. Not a doodle, just “🇺🇸 Live! \nWatch President Trump’s Inauguration”, and nothing about MLK.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to argue that all of these companies, and each of their CEOs, suck, today’s your day. But there are degrees of sucking, and one of these companies is, still, to some degree, not quite like the others.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/cook-mlk\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4cdf2cf52c2ddc3853cdf849db2b0d11fcdd55d6be9e5a63cbd756847a93c2d5","category":"Tech"}
