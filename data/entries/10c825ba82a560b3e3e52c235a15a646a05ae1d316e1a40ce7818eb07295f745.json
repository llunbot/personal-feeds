I’m a fan of putting lights under out-front computer mounts, and the NACA aero profile and fantastic beam pattern make this one an interesting option for riding in the dark. But without a blinking mode, its solid beam would burn through the battery too quickly for long rides on high mode, which was what I needed for decent daytime visibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason it only had non-blinking modes? They made it for every market, which includes Germany, and Germany doesn’t allow blinking lights. But much of the rest of the world does, and those blinking patterns not only extend battery life, they help drivers notice us. So, they’ve made an “International Version” that includes two blinking modes – a 400-lumen Day Flash and a 185-lumen Night Flash.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lightskin-naca-aero-headlight-intl-blink-version-4.jpg\"><img width=\"2109\" height=\"1339\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lightskin-naca-aero-headlight-intl-blink-version-4.jpg\" alt=\"lightskin naca road aero profile bike headlight shown from all angles\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lightskin-naca-aero-headlight-intl-blink-version-4.jpg 2109w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lightskin-naca-aero-headlight-intl-blink-version-4-297x189.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lightskin-naca-aero-headlight-intl-blink-version-4-800x508.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lightskin-naca-aero-headlight-intl-blink-version-4-120x76.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lightskin-naca-aero-headlight-intl-blink-version-4-768x488.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lightskin-naca-aero-headlight-intl-blink-version-4-1536x975.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lightskin-naca-aero-headlight-intl-blink-version-4-2048x1300.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The form factor remains the same, and it keeps the four solid modes ranging from 185 to 520 lumens (30 to 90 lux) with run times from 1.5 to 7.3 hours. Blinking modes extend that to 10 to 31.7 hours. It includes a shield to keep the light from becoming a distraction to the rider, assuming your computer doesn’t block your view of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lightskin-naca-aero-headlight-intl-blink-version-3.jpg\"><img width=\"1379\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lightskin-naca-aero-headlight-intl-blink-version-3.jpg\" alt=\"lightskin naca road aero profile bike headlight light profile\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lightskin-naca-aero-headlight-intl-blink-version-3.jpg 1379w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lightskin-naca-aero-headlight-intl-blink-version-3-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lightskin-naca-aero-headlight-intl-blink-version-3-800x501.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lightskin-naca-aero-headlight-intl-blink-version-3-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lightskin-naca-aero-headlight-intl-blink-version-3-768x481.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The light using a dual projector design to throw a wide but distinct beam pattern, mimicking what vehicle headlights do for drivers, while keeping the upper edge below eye level for oncoming traffic.
