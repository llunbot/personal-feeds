He added that Apple has been working on the 11th-generation ‌iPad‌, seventh-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, and sixth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> for some time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is apparently planning to release new iPads in March, which will likely \"at least\" include these three refreshed devices. The next-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> is also a possibility, but only the \"more minor\" ‌iPad‌ updates appear to be locked down for the spring at the current time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman added that he anticipates that the first-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> will be discontinued alongside the ninth-generation ‌iPad‌, since there will no longer be any new iPads on sale from Apple with a Lightning connector at that point. This change is not expected to happen \"anytime soon.\"<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-new-ipads-scheduled-for-march-2024-launch/\">Gurman: New iPads Scheduled for Launch in March 2024</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-new-ipads-scheduled-for-launch-in-march-2024.2408341/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8b1768766a5e375e237b562630b9629ee90deba3e5c46e3fcf82a16f9938428c","category":"Apple"}
