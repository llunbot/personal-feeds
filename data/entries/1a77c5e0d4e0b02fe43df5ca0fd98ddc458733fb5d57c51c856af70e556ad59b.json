In the middle of the chaos, the IPCC <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/08/new-ipcc-climate-report-is-the-clearest-guidebook-for-selecting-a-future/\">dropped the first installment</a> of its latest climate report, mapping out how our current choices will shape the planet's future. All of this would seem to make now a great time to check in on public views of climate change.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, one of the best sources of such check-ins, the Pew Research Center, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/09/14/in-response-to-climate-change-citizens-in-advanced-economies-are-willing-to-alter-how-they-live-and-work/\">did its most recent polling on the topic</a> way back in February. The survey of industrialized economies shows a strong and growing worry that climate change will affect people personally and a willingness to make changes to avoid the worst of its impacts. Still, because of the timing, it's likely that opinion has shifted even further since.</p>\n<h2>Around the world</h2>\n<p>Pew surveyed people in 17 different industrialized economies in North America, Europe, and around the Pacific Rim. Obviously left out are the developing economies, which may have the most impact on the trajectory of the future climate, as well as China. But the survey does provide some perspective on public opinion in the countries that are actively pursuing policies intended to address their carbon emissions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795300#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795300&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1a77c5e0d4e0b02fe43df5ca0fd98ddc458733fb5d57c51c856af70e556ad59b","category":"Tech"}
