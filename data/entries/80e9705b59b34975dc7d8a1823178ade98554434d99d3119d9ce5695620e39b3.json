{"title":"TipTop Shop App Offers Single-Transaction Buying, Selling and Device Trade-Ins","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/15/tiptop-shop-trade-in-app/","date":1710515074000,"content":"<a href=\"https://tiptop.com\">TipTop</a>, an app for trading in used devices and getting instant cash, today launched a new feature called Shop. With TipTop Shop, users are able to buy new, open box, and refurbished items, while also trading in old devices at the same time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/tiptop-shop.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" />\r<br />\nThe feature allows customers to sell items, trade them in, and/or buy new devices in a single transaction. It is a unique option for a trade-in/device selling app, as there is no need for a multi-step process when upgrading to a new device.\r<br />\n<blockquote>Now, with TipTop Shop you can purchase any item and, at the same time, trade in any device from any manufacturer. Cross brand trade-in is an industry first, as other trade-in programs rely on multiple step transactions, gift cards or other complicated arrangements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWant to trade in your Samsung Galaxy for a new iPad? No problem. An Apple HomePod mini for a solid discount on the new Nintendo Switch? You bet. Trading in your iPhone for a Nothing Phone? We can help with that. And TipTop can do it all in one tap.</blockquote>\r<br />\nTipTop was founded by Bastian Lehmann, the founder and CEO of Postmates, and its marketing VP is former <em>TechCrunch</em> editor-in-chief Matthew Panzarino.  The app's trade-in prices are similar to the prices offered by Apple, though it offers more than Apple on some newer devices and less than Apple on older devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe app can be downloaded from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> for free.
