This one is the odd \"Google Business Messaging\" service—basically an instant messaging client that is built into Google Maps. If you looked up a participating business in Google Maps or Google Search on a phone, the main row of buttons in the place card would read something like \"Call,\" \"Chat,\" \"Directions,\" and \"Website.\" That \"Chat\" button is the service we're talking about. It would launch a full messaging interface inside the Google Maps app, and businesses were expected to use it for customer service purposes. Google's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/\">deeply dysfunctional</a> messaging strategy might lead people to joke about a theoretical \"Google Maps Messaging\" service, but it already exists and has existed for years, and now it's being shut down.</p>\n<p></p><aside>\n  <h2>Google kills product</h2>\n\t<ul>\n\t    <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-is-killing-off-the-messaging-service-inside-google-maps/\">Google is killing off the messaging service inside Google Maps</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/google-is-killing-off-its-one-vpn-service/\">Google kills “One” VPN service, says “people simply weren’t using it”</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/google-podcasts-shuts-down-tomorrow-april-2/\">Google Podcasts shuts down tomorrow, April 2</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2024/03/googles-phone-app-no-longer-searches-google-maps/\">Google’s phone app no longer searches Google Maps</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/google-search-kills-off-cached-webpages/\">Google will no longer back up the Internet: Cached webpages are dead</a></li>\n    </ul>\n  <span><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/series/google-kills-product/\">View more stories</a></span>\n</aside>\nSearch Engine Land's <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/google-business-profile-chat-and-call-history-going-away-442666\">Barry Schwartz</a> was the first to spot the shutdown emails being sent out to participating businesses.

On July 15, 2024, the ability to start a new chat will be disabled, and on July 31, 2024, both services will be shut down. Google is letting businesses download past chat conversations via Google Takeout.<p></p>\n<p>Google's Maps messaging service was Google Messaging Service No. 16 in our giant <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/7/#h3\">History of Google Messaging</a> article. The feature has undergone many changes, so it's a bit hard to follow. The Google Maps Messaging button launched in <a href=\"https://www.seroundtable.com/message-google-my-business-24140.html\">2017</a>, when it would have been called \"Google My Business Chat.\" This wasn't quite its own service yet—the messaging button would either launch your SMS app or boot into another dead Google messaging product, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/6/#h2\">Google Allo</a>!</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027430#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027430&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d025100658a9c72a2253547714f3b31517804a763afb58c8d4a3534dc241a798","category":"Tech"}
