{"title":"Gallery: The Tour de la Provence returns with the Mads Pedersen show","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/the-tour-de-la-provence-returns-with-the-mads-pedersen-show","date":1707741975000,"content":"\n      <p>Founded in 2016, the Tour de la Provence quickly earned a reputation as one of the most beautiful early-season races on the calendar, as it looped around picturesque French region of Provence. But only months ago, the future of the race was in doubt after the 2023 edition was cancelled due to management problems, and it was far from certain if the race would return. Thanks to a small group of investors, as well as the founding newspaper La Provence, the race was salvaged. And after a successful return, it is safe to say that the Tour de la Provence has been reborn.</p>\n<p>This year’s edition opened with a short but picturesque time trial along the beaches of Marseille, while the following three stages finished in the picturesque towns of Martigues, Manosque and Arles.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p>While only five WorldTour teams were on the start line for the first year back, the Lidl-Trek team came with a powerful squad led by their star, Mads Pedersen. And they quickly took control of the race, with Pedersen winning the opening time trial and the two following stages. For Pedersen, the Tour de la Provence was his second straight stage race victory after l’Etoile de Bessèges in early February. It is safe to say that he is ready for the spring Classics.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/01stg01_Pedersen00_tour_de_la_provence_20224.jpg?v=1707733464\" />Pedersen was the heavy favourite in the opening time trial, which rolled along the Mediterranean beaches in the heart of Marseille. He delivered, taking the stage and the overall lead of this four-day race.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/02stg01_pedersen_protocol02tour_de_la_provence_20224.jpg?v=1707733605\" />Pedersen reflects on his victory.

While Vincent Van Gogh was perhaps the town’s most notable resident, it remains the region's cultural capital. <img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/18stg04_breakaway_camargue_tour_de_la_provence_20224.jpg?v=1707735273\" />The breakaway went through the marshes of the French Camargue.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/19stg04_pedsersen_peloton02_tour_de_la_provence_20224.jpg?v=1707735480\" />It’s not every day that the race leader can be seen driving the pace at the front, but Pedersen (second from left) took plenty of pulls as the pack shattered into numerous echelons along the windswept flatlands of the French Camargue.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/20stg04_breakaway01_tour_de_la_provence_20224.jpg?v=1707735548\" />The breakaway retains a tight formation along the isolated roads of stage four.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/21stg04_finish01_tour_de_la_provence_20224.jpg?v=1707735592\" />And no, Pedersen did not win the final stage of the Tour de la Provence, instead, Belgian sprinter Tom Van Asbroeck pipped Sam Bennett at the line in downtown Arles. <img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/22stg04_pedersen_podium01_tour_de_la_provence_20224.jpg?v=1707735676\" />Pedersen makes his final round of interviews after the finish of the Tour de Provence, which he dominated in an incontestable manner.</p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"3e8b541550e866fa33b65813c00c6fddf89be2f7256e7b7ddc5580bf761cd62f","category":"Cycling"}
