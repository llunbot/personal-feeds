The term groupset generally refers to the parts on any bike that operate its gears and brakes, although they can include other items. Most commonly, a single groupset will supply the bike’s drivetrain (derailleurs, chain, cassette, crankset, bottom bracket), combined shift and brake levers, along with the brakes themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Covering thousands of different component options, all these parts are grouped into different tiers. At the top of the Shimano groupset hierachy, you have the Dura-Ace groupset, ubiquitous on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/worldtour-team-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">bikes at the Tour de France</a>. The range goes all the way down to the Claris groupset found on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cheap-road-bikes-under-1000\" target=\"_blank\">entry-level road bikes </a>costing a fraction of the price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This hierarchy means the groupset a bike uses is often employed as shorthand for where it sits in its maker’s range.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Shimano groupset should I buy?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>More expensive groupsets will tend to have more gears, better brakes, and offer lower weight. That said, many groupsets share technology, so key areas like braking power are often standardised across several tiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below you’ll find a quick explanation of each of the major Shimano road bike groupsets, along with a list of its key features and variants.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Every Shimano road groupset compared… </h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shimano Dura-Ace R9200: Flagship race groupset</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/08/02114149/specialized-sworks-aethos-24-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"specialized-sworks-aethos-24\" /><figcaption>Matthew Loveridge</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> The best of the best. The electronic-only Dura-Ace groupset is very expensive yet almost identical to the cheaper Ultegra version</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RRP:</strong> Dura-Ace R9270 (Di2 Disc without power meter): £3,632</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cassette:</strong> 12-speed</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Largest sprocket:</strong> 34t</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Shifting:</strong> Electronic only</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Hydraulic disc or cable rim</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-dura-ace-r9200-and-ultegra-r8100-shimano-finally-goes-12-speed\" target=\"_blank\">Launched in 2021</a>, these are the best road bike components Shimano makes. R9200-series Dura-Ace is designed to be as light as possible, is focussed on racing and is very expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The groupset you’ll see used by professionals at the elite level, Dura-Ace’s value/performance ratio is tipped firmly in the latter’s direction – this is the money-no-object option. This is also where you’ll tend to see the latest features introduced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This dedication to new technology means the latest Dura-Ace R9200 groupset is available only with Shimano’s Di2 electronic shifting.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02223830/specialized-sworks-aethos-23-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Rear derailleur on road bike\" /><figcaption>Matthew Loveridge / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also upgraded to 12-speed, it’s still aimed at fast riding, yet now also includes some more user-friendly features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key among these is its ability to accommodate a large 34-tooth rear sprocket, letting less-than-pro riders make it over steep or extended climbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02223835/shimano_dura_ace_grouspet.png\" alt=\"shimano_dura_ace_grouspet\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The system is now semi-wireless, unlike former Di2 products. This means that the shifters communicate to the derailleurs without cables, making for clean and easy installation. Both derailleurs are still linked to a single central battery to provide the power for shifting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charged from a USB socket via a proprietary cable with a single port on the rear derailleur, Shimano claims most riders will manage over 1,000km before needing to recharge.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02223830/specialized-sworks-aethos-23-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Rear derailleur on road bike\" /><figcaption>Matthew Loveridge / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While mechanical shifting might have got the chop, unlike its rival groupset-maker SRAM, Shimano has decided to provide both disc brake and rim brake versions of its Dura-Ace groupset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dura-Ace is a groupset with an incredible range of race-specific options, including a dual-sided power meter, along with an oversized 54/40 crankset for fast and flat stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-dura-ace-r9200-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano Dura-Ace R9200 review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/shimano-dura-ace-vs-sram-red-etap-axs\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Shimano Dura-Ace vs. SRAM Red eTap AXS</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy Dura-Ace components from <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20283&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;clickref=cyclist+shimano+groupsets+dura+ace&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freewheel.co.uk%2Fcomponents%2Fgroupsets%2Fshimano-dura-ace\" target=\"_blank\">Freewheel</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shimano Ultegra R8100: Best buy for racers</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02223843/shimano_ultergra_di2_groupset-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"shimano_ultergra_di2_groupset\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> If you want Shimano electronic shifting, buy this. All the critical functionality of Dura-Ace at a more moderate price</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RRP:</strong> R8170 (Di2 Disc without power meter) £2,370</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cassette:</strong> 12-speed</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Largest sprocket:</strong> 34t</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Shifting:</strong> Electronic only</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Hydraulic disc or cable rim</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano surprised many people when it released the newest Ultegra groupset at the same time as it did Dura-Ace. The two have always been closely linked, and with this latest update are now almost indistinguishable from one another when it comes to functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both are electronic only, both use semi-wireless connectivity, both have 12-speed cassettes, and both offer options covering hydraulic disc brakes or conventional callipers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As has always been the case, Ultegra is still very much a racing groupset despite a lower price. In fact, it’s not unusual to see pro teams using Ultegra components, either to save money or to make up a few grams and hit the UCI’s minimum bicycle weight limit of 6.8kg.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02223845/shimano_ultegra_di2_groupset-970x645.jpeg\" alt=\"shimano_ultegra_di2_groupset\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, weight is another area where the two groupsets are again now more closely aligned. With tiny weight savings on almost every component, spending the extra £1,300 or so to level-up to Dura-Ace will add up to a cumulative reduction of less than 300g.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s not enough to sandbag anyone’s racing dreams, and when you add in the ever-present possibility of having to replace a crash-damaged component, Ultegra might be the real racer’s groupset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to reiterate, braking and shifting performance are exactly the same as that of Dura-Ace. You also now get the option to spec a dual-sided crank-based power meter, plus Ultegra now has a new range of matching carbon wheels, just like Dura-Ace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t get the same racing-only 54/40 crankest option, but you can always swap one in. Otherwise, the available ratios are now the same too.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read more about the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-dura-ace-r9200-and-ultegra-r8100-shimano-finally-goes-12-speed\" target=\"_blank\">Ultegra R8100 groupset</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shimano 105 Di2 R7100: Electronic shifting at a (somewhat) sensible price</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02223848/shimano_105_di2-970x582.jpg\" alt=\"shimano_105_di2\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> With 12-sprockets and semi-wireless electronic shifting, there’s little to separate 105 Di2 from its peers except for weight</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RRP:</strong> 105 Di2 R7100: approx £1,700</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cassette:</strong> 12-speed</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Largest sprocket:</strong> 36t</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Shifting:</strong> Electronic only</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Hydraulic disc only</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano 105 has always been thought of as a workhorse, and 2022 saw the launch of a Di2 version of what many consider the first ‘proper’ road groupset in Shimano’s hierarchy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It brings over wholesale most of Ultegra and Dura-Ace’s essential features, and boasts 12-speed cassettes and semi-wireless electronic shifting. 105 Di2 R7100 is also the first Shimano groupset to completely kill off conventional calliper brakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new 105 Di2 is a direct competitor for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-rival-etap-axs-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM Rival AXS</a>, another option for budget-focussed riders who still consider themselves too posh to push their own derailleurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"522\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02223852/shimano_105_di2_groupset_wide_ratio-970x522.jpg\" alt=\"shimano_105_di2_groupset_wide_ratio\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the trend for off-road riding hasn’t totally passed 105 by, like its bigger siblings, 105 Di2 R7100 remains a road-focussed groupset. At the same time, its single rear derailleur option can now work with cassettes as wide as 11-36t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combining with a compact crankset to provide a sub 1:1 ratio, it should work well for all fitness levels and even off-tarmac riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>105 is the first of Shimano’s groupsets to swap wholesale to disc, and its maker claims to have tweaked the brakes to provide a ‘lighter, smoother lever action and expanded control’, along with less rubbing and easier bleeding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this hasn’t been achieved using Shimano’s well-regarded ‘Servo Wave’ technology, which alters the leverage ratio as you pull the brake, almost every other facet of the group will be familiar to Ultegra or Dura-Ace users.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02223900/shimano_105_di2_1-970x582.jpg\" alt=\"shimano_105_di2_1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These include the only slightly revised shape of the components and ergonomic interfaces. The semi-wireless cabling that sees both derailleurs connected to a central battery but then communicating wirelessly with the cockpit also carries over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weight is one key area of difference. At around 3,000g for the complete groupset, this is about 300g more than the significantly pricier Ultegra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no native power meter option, but 105 Di2 gets a matching range of wheelsets. These are non-series, ie, at the same level but not strictly part of the groupset, and they feature all-carbon rims in 32 and 46mm depths.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read more about <a href=\"https://auth.cyclist.co.uk/news/10724/shimano-105-di2\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano 105 Di2</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Read our buyer’s guide to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/bikes-with-shimano-105-di2\" target=\"_blank\">bikes with Shimano 105 Di2</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shimano GRX gravel groupsets</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/02174705/shimano_grx_groupset_-970x645.jpeg\" alt=\"shimano_grx_groupset_\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> A versatile gravel groupset with additional gearing and brake options that will appeal to other styles of rider too</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cassette:</strong> 10-, 11- or 12-speed</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Largest sprocket</strong>: 51t</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Shifting:</strong> Mechanical/electronic</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Hydraulic disc only</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>GRX is a slight curveball in Shimano’s lineup in that its components are explicitly designed for gravel bikes, although their features will also appeal to touring cyclists and cyclocross racers.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-gravel-gearing-how-to-get-lower-gears\" target=\"_blank\">Gravel bike gearing: Everything you need to know</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It offers a mixture of components at Ultegra, 105, and Tiagra-equivalent levels, and borrows liberally from Shimano’s road and mountain bike ranges. The hierarchy breaks down like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RX820/610 series: </strong>12-speed mechanical shifting with two single chainring and one double chainring option</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>RX810 series:</strong> 11-speed Ultegra level (R8000 series equivalent) with mechanical and Di2 variants</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>RX600 series:</strong> 11-speed 105 level</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>RX400 series:</strong> 10-speed Tiagra level</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But what sets it apart? For one thing, GRX is only available with hydraulic disc brakes. It also comes in versions based around either single- or double-chainring cranksets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of gearing, these cranksets can be paired to either a ten, 11 or 12-speed cassette (with the appropriate derailleurs).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GRX groupset’s rear derailleurs are also unique in accommodating very wide cassettes up to a maximum 11-51 for the 1×12-speed variant, although only up to 42 teeth for 1×11-speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/02135719/shimano_grx_di2_groupset-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"shimano_grx_di2_groupset\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rear derailleurs allow incredibly easy-spinning gears for off-road adventuring, and also include a clutch mechanism that stops the chain from rattling around and detaching itself on bumpy ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many other features are tweaked to work better with bigger tyres and wilder conditions. For instance, the front derailleur and cranksets are designed to provide better clearance when used alongside wider tyres.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/02135721/shimano_grx_di2_review_01-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"shimano_grx_di2_review_01\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The braking steals technology from Shimano’s mountain bike products and, as such, is tailored to off-road riding. There are also unique features like in-line brake levers, which can be added to the top of the handlebars. These cut into the hydraulic brake lines to provide a second position from which to brake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ergonomics of both sets of levers have also been tweaked for off-road use. Rugged and reliable, it’s not afraid of a bit of mud either.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02223901/shimano-grx-limited-3-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"shimano-grx-limited-3\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022 Shimano added a polished silver GRX RX810 variant called <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/shimano-grx-limited\" target=\"_blank\">GRX Limited</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our 11-speed <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-grx-di2-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano GRX Di2 </a>and 12-speed <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-grx-rx820-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">GRX RX820</a> groupset reviews.</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy Shimano GRX components from <a href=\"https://www.freewheel.co.uk/catalogsearch/result/?q=grx\" target=\"_blank\">Freewheel</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shimano 105: Brilliant mid-range groupset</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02223905/shimano_105_groupset_main-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"shimano_105_groupset_main-1\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Shimano’s default mechanical groupset. Good value and very functional. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cassette:</strong> 12-speed</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Largest sprocket:</strong> 36t</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Shifting:</strong> Mechanical</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Hydraulic disc</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The workhorse in the Shimano range, and what moderately snobby people consider the first proper road bike groupset (real snobs will say it’s Ultegra).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With its premium sibling having gone electronic, 105 has been left carrying the flag for mechanical shifting (alongside its own electronic option), now with the latest <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/shimano-105-mechanical-r7100-groupset\" target=\"_blank\">105 R7100</a> upgraded to 12-speed shifting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this, it’s an excellent groupset and outstanding value. Now available with disc brakes only, 105 is, of course, a bit heavier than Ultegra, but only by a couple of hundred grams in most configurations. However, you’re often getting slight downgrades in terms of missing out on particular treatments or other small touches, such as the use of standard Hyperglide profiles for the cassette teeth rather than Hyperglide+, which is used for Ultegra and Dura-Ace and is claimed to increase shifting speeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02223910/shimano_105_groupset-970x970.png\" alt=\"shimano_105_groupset\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, 105 represents a safe haven for anyone that doesn’t want to switch to more expensive electronic shifting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, the difference between 105 and Ultegra has been minor and mostly in feeling and small refinements; now comparing it to Shimano’s electronic groupsets means there are considerable differences to point out. In future, who knows?</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/shimano-105-mechanical-r7100-groupset\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano 105 R7000 review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shimano Tiagra 4700: Affordable 10-speed groupset</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02223914/shimano_tiagra_groupset-970x728.jpeg\" alt=\"shimano_tiagra_groupset\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> More capable than the snobs let on. With hydraulic disc and wide-ratios, it’s a competent and versatile – if slightly heavy – groupset</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cassette:</strong> 10-speed</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Largest sprocket:</strong> 34t</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Electronic version:</strong> No</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Hydraulic disc or cable rim</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Tiagra 4700 components look great compared to previous generations. Many of the features from Shimano’s premium groupsets also carry over, allowing less expensive bikes to copy the appearance of top-end bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s first look at what you don’t get: first of all Tiagra is 10-speed only, so you get two sprockets fewer than 105, Ultegra and Dura-Ace. However, Tiagra is the level where you start to see more weird and wonderful gearing options. Stick to a standard double crankset and you’ll get the conventional choice of pro-compact 52/36, compact 50/34, or easy-spinning sub-compact 48/34. There’s also the option to fit a triple crankset with three rings and a matching front shifter to unlock an even more comprehensive range of gears.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02223919/shimano_tiagra_groupset_brakes.jpeg\" alt=\"shimano_tiagra_groupset_brakes\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, with only ten sprockets at the back, the jumps between gears will be more significant, but the range you can attain is the same or bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this means that Tiagra is a versatile groupset that’s great on a cheap racing bike but can also handle lots of other duties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we continue to slide down the hierarchy, most components put on a bit of weight. Solid rather than hollow, the crankset is a particular offender, adding just under 200g.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some less glamorous components also get downgraded. For instance, the durable bottom bracket found on the 105 and Ultegra groupsets is jettisoned for one that’s a similar weight but less robust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Shadow design that allows the rear derailleur to closely follow the cassette on posher groupsets is also absent. Happily, other functions such as the operation and power of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-tiagra-hydraulic-disc-brake-groupset\" target=\"_blank\">Tiagra hydraulic disc</a> or conventional rim brakes remain faultless.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shimano Sora R3000: Budget-conscious 9-speed groupset</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02223920/shimano_sora_groupset-970x728.jpeg\" alt=\"shimano_sora_groupset\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Gaps between the nine gears begin to tell, and no hydraulic disc option. Still, Sora works well and looks the business</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cassette:</strong> 9-speed</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Largest sprocket:</strong> 34t</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Electronic version:</strong> No</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Cable disc or rim brake</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Closing in on the entry-level, Shimano’s Sora groupset uses nine sprockets on the rear. It accommodates cassettes with cogs of up to 34-tooth, so you’ll get an extensive range of gears if you want them, although the jumps between each might unsettle performance-focussed riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the groupset can be assembled with either rim brakes or disc brakes, its levers are exclusively mechanical. This means you can run mechanical disc brakes, but not hydraulic ones. Sora rim brakes are still a good choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02223924/shimano_sora_groupset_shifter-970x728.jpeg\" alt=\"shimano_sora_groupset_shifter\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, the weight of all the components again goes up slightly. Still, it’s worth noting that the total effect is only a couple of hundred grams versus Tiagra, while the whole groupset is still within an incredibly respectable distance of Shimano’s top-end groupsets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a fact that means, if you boil it down to pure physics, the amount you save with each push up the hierarchy comes with diminishing returns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there are some drawbacks besides the lack of sprockets, cable-only levers, and slightly increased weight. The single 50/34 crankset option is aimed at marginally more leisurely users, and won’t suit some racers. The system’s ergonomics aren’t quite as nice in the hand, while the action of the levers is a little more agricultural. At the same time, the durability of components like the chain, bottom bracket, and cassette remains excellent.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shimano Claris R2000: The cheapest mainstream road groupset</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02223928/shimano_claris_groupset-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"shimano_claris_groupset\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> A great introduction. Claris lacks some key features and can vary in how it’s assembled, yet offers reliable quality</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cassette:</strong> 8-speed</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Largest sprocket:</strong> 32t</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Electronic version:</strong> No</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Cable disc or rim brake</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As the cheapest groupset Shimano makes with integrated ‘dual control’ levers, the 8-speed Claris groupset is a dependable entry-level option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following an update a few years ago now, not only do its shifters now follow the same basic configuration as that found across the whole (mechanical) Shimano range, but their cables also run neatly underneath the handlebar tape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re a great addition to any budget-friendly bicycle and have an extremely clean look.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"686\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02223932/shimano_claris_groupset_crankset-970x686.jpeg\" alt=\"shimano_claris_groupset_crankset\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, elsewhere many technologies found across other Shimano groupsets fall away. For instance, although the crankset still comes in a two-piece design with an external bottom bracket, you might find your bike fitted with a more lumpen three-piece crank using a square taper or Octalink bottom bracket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The smaller number of sprockets also starts to impact the gearing range. The largest rear sprocket drops to a 32-tooth, meaning if you want to go for a wide range of gears, you’ll need to use a more cumbersome triple front crankset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weight jumps are noticeable depending on the configuration, while you’ll again be restricted to cable operated discs or rim brakes. You’ll still benefit from Shimano’s excellent dual-pivot design if you do elect to run rim brakes, which is the benchmark for good reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, things are clunkier, but having dropped five levels from Dura-Ace, perhaps what’s most surprising is how much remains familiar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How does each groupset compare with its immediate neighbour?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02223937/ribble_endurance_al_disc_tiagra-970x648.jpeg\" alt=\"ribble_endurance_al_disc_tiagra\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In a kind of groupset top trumps, we’ve listed the main differences between each groupset and its nearest neighbour in Shimano’s hierarchy. Here’s how they match up, to help you decide whether it’s worth spending a little extra or saving your pennies to spend elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shimano Dura-Ace vs. Ultegra</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s pretty hard to think of legitimate reasons you’d benefit from choosing Dura-Ace outside of WorldTour-level competition, considering Ultegra now comes with all the same features and only 300g difference in weight. From a raw physics point of view, you’ll save a tiny bit of mass, while the profile of some parts is marginally more aerodynamic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with the brakes and electronic shifting functioning in precisely the same way, a blindfolded tester would struggle to tell them apart. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the cost is probably recouping the firm’s development expenditure, plus some people will always want the very best regardless of the price. Dura-Ace is fancier-looking but Ultegra is by far the winner when it comes to cost/benefit analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shimano Ultegra vs. 105 Di2</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels as if there’s a bit of badge engineering with the drop from Ultegra to 105 Di2. Both are 12-speed and they share their electronics, but 105 Di2 has missed out on a few top features including Hyperglide+, fancier brake lever action, a third button on the shifters and a rim brake option. On the other hand, its cassettes go up to 11-36t, offering a little extra range.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shimano 105 Di2 vs. Shimano 105</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the difference between the latest electronic-only 12-speed Dura-Ace and Ultegra groupsets is now minuscule, the gap between 105 Di2 and 105 is more significant, as it’s now a choice between electronic and mechanical shifting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in terms of mechanical function, the basic design of many components is still quite similar. These include elements such as the ‘Shadow Plus’ derailleur design, gear range and the way the disc brakes work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shimano 105 vs. Tiagra</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The mechanical Tiagra groupset is pretty closely related to 105, though it does drop two sprockets. With ten gears at the back, this leaves the resulting jumps quite a bit larger. There’s actually a more diverse range of parts to pick from, however, since Tiagra is less solely focussed on road racing,.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, most suffer a little relative to their more expensive peers. This sees the rear derailleur employ a more basic design, while the shifters are a tad less ergonomic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When taken all together, Tiagra is only a bit heavier than 105, although some components like the crankset are notably lardy versus those on the more expensive groupset.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shimano Tiagra vs. Sora</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it’s the fact that its top three groupsets have gone electric, but both Tiagra and Sora are looking quite spruce these days. You’re looking at just 9 speeds by the time you get down to Sora, which well-heeled roadies first got their hands on in Dura-Ace guise in 1996, with 10, 11 and finally 12 speeds added in successive generations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, other valuable features have trickled down faster, one of which is the 11-34t maximum cassette range. This means you’ll be able to find gears to get up most hills, even if the gaps between them will be slightly larger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In common with Tiagra, Sora carries quite a bit of weight in the cassette and crankset; not that this is annoying, we’re mentioning it more to point out that there’s little benefit to upgrading these parts by a single tier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shimano Sora vs. Claris</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Claris groupset offers quite a range of different fitments, and can be built up in many ways. It does a passing imitation of the more expensive Sora in its most racing-style format, albeit with an 8-speed cassette and a slightly reduced range of ratios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if it comes made up with some alternative parts, you could lose out on the light and stiff two-piece crankset and end up with a chunkier triple chainring option that makes front shifting harder to keep in tune.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Durability is excellent and Claris is still very competent for an entry-level groupset regardless of how it arrives, even if the operation is slightly clunky and gaps between gear ratios significant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Want to know more about groupsets?
