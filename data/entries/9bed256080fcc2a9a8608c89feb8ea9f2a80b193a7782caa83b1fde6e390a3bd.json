{"title":"Starlink: Here’s a free satellite dish—if you pay $120 a month instead of $90","link":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/starlink-heres-a-free-satellite-dish-if-you-pay-120-a-month-instead-of-90/","date":1746643285000,"content":"<p>Starlink last week <a href=\"https://x.com/starlink/status/1917029886432317947\">announced</a> a new deal for its standard hardware kit, giving the satellite dish and Wi-Fi router for free to customers who sign up for a 12-month commitment.</p>\n<p>The deal is reminiscent of the hardware rental agreements long used by cable companies, but Starlink's offer has generated a bit of excitement. Some analysts <a href=\"https://x.com/thejoekane/status/1917564442478362908\">suggested</a> that the free kits are a reason for the federal government's $42 billion broadband deployment fund to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/starlink-benefits-as-trump-admin-rewrites-rules-for-42b-grant-program/\">send grants</a> to Starlink instead of to fiber-to-the-home providers, or that the government should <a href=\"https://www.fierce-network.com/broadband/starlink-gets-aggressive-free-gear-new-broadband-customers\">buy Starlink kits at the regular price of $349 each</a> so that Elon Musk's company doesn't have to eat the cost.</p>\n<p>You may not be surprised to learn that the free hardware kit isn't really free. But much of the discussion around the offer has ignored the fine details that could make a reasonable Starlink buyer decide to reject the deal. Similarly, policymakers deciding which ISPs should get government money might be wise to remember that fiber provides superior and more future-proof Internet service and that Starlink's offers to customers could change at any time.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/starlink-heres-a-free-satellite-dish-if-you-pay-120-a-month-instead-of-90/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/starlink-heres-a-free-satellite-dish-if-you-pay-120-a-month-instead-of-90/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9bed256080fcc2a9a8608c89feb8ea9f2a80b193a7782caa83b1fde6e390a3bd","category":"Tech"}
