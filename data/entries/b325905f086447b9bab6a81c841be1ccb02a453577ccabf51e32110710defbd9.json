{"title":"WSJ: ‘Goldman Is Looking for a Way Out of Its Partnership With Apple’","link":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-is-looking-for-a-way-out-of-its-partnership-with-apple-79849a91","date":1688403600000,"content":"\n<p>AnnaMaria Andriotis, reporting for The Wall Street Journal (<a href=\"https://apple.news/AKAekQoCCQE2082_Qekyo0g\">News+ link</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Wall Street firm is in talks with American Express to take\nover its Apple credit card and other ventures with the tech giant,\naccording to people familiar with the matter. Goldman went public\nwith plans to scale back its consumer business late last year, but\nit appeared committed to the Apple relationship. The bank recently\nextended the partnership through the end of the decade, agreed to\nsupport Apple’s “buy now, pay later” offering and launched a bank\naccount with the tech company.</p>\n\n<p>Now it is in talks to offload those businesses and its credit-card\npartnership to Amex, according to people familiar with the\ndiscussions. A deal with Amex isn’t imminent or assured, people\nfamiliar with the conversations said, and it could take a while to\ntransfer the partnership in any case. Apple would have to agree to\na transfer. The tech company is aware of the talks, which have\nbeen ongoing for months, the people said.

Not quite in the territory of Donald Trump somehow losing money while running casinos, but it’s up there. Are they issuing Apple Cards to deadbeats? (Apparently, yes: <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/12/goldmans-gs-apple-card-business-has-a-surprising-subprime-problem.html\">they’ve been issuing a lot of cards to people with bad credit</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>If Goldman does bail, AmEx would be as good a partner as any for Apple: they know how to deliver a premium experience <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/american-express-ceo-says-the-business-is-firing-on-all-cylinders-fe875f3d\">and turn a good profit doing so</a>.</p>\n\n<p><small>* <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/12/bloomberg-big-con\">You know</a>.</small></p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/goldman-apple-card-losses\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b325905f086447b9bab6a81c841be1ccb02a453577ccabf51e32110710defbd9","category":"Tech"}
