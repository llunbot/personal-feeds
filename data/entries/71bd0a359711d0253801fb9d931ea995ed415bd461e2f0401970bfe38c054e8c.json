{"title":"2025 Rocky Mountain Element: First Ride Review – Morgan Taylor","link":"https://theradavist.com/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review/","date":1729076346000,"content":"<p><em>The <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2023-rocky-mountain-element-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Rocky Mountain</a> Element has been updated for 2025 with a new flexstay suspension design, shaving 350 grams from the frame weight while increasing rear-end stiffness. Despite the lighter weight, the Element remains a progressive cross-country platform that balances efficiency and capability. Read on for Morgan’s initial impressions and photos of the new Element.</em><span></span></p>\n<p>When I asked to review the previous iteration of Rocky Mountain’s short travel full suspension bike last year, some folks wondered why I wanted to review a platform that would be two years old by the time I <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2023-rocky-mountain-element-review/\" target=\"_blank\">published my review</a>. Truth be told, I had ridden an Element at a Rocky Mountain demo day in summer of 2022 and was blown away by the evolution of the platform. I’d had a taste and I wanted more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-5.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-5.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-5.jpg?resize=1200,1800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-5.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-5.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w\" /></a> <a href=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/12/morgan-taylor-rocky-mountain-element-review-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/morgan-taylor-rocky-mountain-element-review-2.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/morgan-taylor-rocky-mountain-element-review-2.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/morgan-taylor-rocky-mountain-element-review-2.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/morgan-taylor-rocky-mountain-element-review-2.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/morgan-taylor-rocky-mountain-element-review-2.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Too Good For Its Own Good</h3>\n<p>My take on the 2023 Element was that it was possibly too good for its own good: way more capable than any of its XC-bred predecessors, but still very efficient uphill. I found myself drawn to routes that were definitely outside the Element’s intent, and I found its limits – and my own. I swapped for tires with more volume and grip and wished for more supportive fork damping and better brakes… which brings us to the newly redesigned, 2025 Element.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-13.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-13.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-13.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-13.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-13.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-13.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Spec Updates</h3>\n<p>While there are more technically-interesting updates to talk about (like the removal of a pivot), before committing to this review I had to know about the parts spec. As it turns out, Rocky Mountain did update the C70 Shimano spec to include a GRIP2 damper and 4-piston brakes for the 2024 model year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-19.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-19.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-19.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-19.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-19.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-19.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></a></p>\n<p>For 2025, the previous dual options of SRAM or Shimano builds have been brought together into a single C70 build with Fox suspension and dropper, and SRAM drivetrain and brakes. This year’s C70 gets a 34 Float with a GRIP X damper. The 34’s air spring is still maxed out under my 205 pound weight, but the additional damping support makes a noticeable difference.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-22.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-22.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-22.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-22.jpg?resize=1200,1800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-22.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-22.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w\" /></a> <a href=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-21.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-21.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-21.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-21.jpg?resize=1200,1800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-21.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-21.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w\" /></a></p>\n<p>To complement the GX Transmission wireless drivetrain, the brakes are SRAM’s Level Bronze, 4-piston with 180mm G2 rotors. While I’m sure some will lament the loss of the cable-actuated XT shifting option at the $6999 C70 spec, I’m happy to note that the $4499 C30 spec gets that XT drivetrain and the very decent Shimano MT4120 brakes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-18.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-18.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-18.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-18.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-18.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-18.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></a></p>\n<h3>The Flex Stay</h3>\n<p>Compared to the previous Element’s rear end, the Smoothlink SL flex pivot is lighter both visually and physically. In fact, I’m sure these chainstays are in the running for the thinnest on Earth. Removing the bearings and hardware at the axle pivot, in addition to refinements in the front triangle, has shaved 350 grams from the frame weight.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-15.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-15.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-15.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-15.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-15.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-15.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></a></p>\n<p>Rocky Mountain says the new rear end is both lighter <em>and</em> stiffer, which I believe, despite not having complaints about the previous frame’s stiffness. While I didn’t ride that bike long enough to wear out the seat stay bearings, word from higher mileage users was they required regular replacement. The seat stay pivot bearings have now been upgraded to dual row to address that issue.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-14.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-14.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-14.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-14.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-14.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-14.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></a></p>\n<h3>If It Ain’t Broke</h3>\n<p>With the previous generation being such a smashing evolution of the Element platform, Rocky Mountain was smart to leave the geometry relatively unchanged for 2025. Reach numbers remain the same, but the rear ends are a bit longer, head tubes a touch shorter, and seat tubes about a degree steeper.</p>\n<p>On that last point, I did notice that the fit feels a bit smaller than the previous Element. Just over a degree of difference in the seat tube angle on the size Large makes for a 14mm reduction in effective top tube at the same 480mm reach. While I considered a longer stem on the previous review bike, it seems altogether unavoidable on this one.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-3.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-3.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-3.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-3.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></a></p>\n<h3>First Ride</h3>\n<p>My first ride on this bike had to be on the wettest day we’ve had in months. While I was a bit bummed to be soaked through in 15 minutes after two beautiful sunny fall days, that feeling dissolved as I got into the rhythm with the Element and its familiar climbing efficiency.</p>\n<p>Once I pointed it downhill, it was like I was slicing and dicing with an old friend. I’m going to try my best to keep myself out of trouble this time around with the more-than-capable Element, but I’ve already got a feeling it’ll be pulling me further and further into the woods.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-24.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-24.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-24.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-24.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-24.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review-24.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></a></p>\n<h3>2025 Rocky Mountain Element C70 Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>120mm rear travel, 130mm front</li>\n<li>new Smoothlink SL flexstay rear end</li>\n<li>350g weight reduction over previous Element frame</li>\n<li>Ride 4 adjustable geometry, 65.4º head tube angle in neutral setting</li>\n<li>29″ wheels (S-XL) / 27.5″ wheels (XS)</li>\n<li>fully enclosed internal routing</li>\n<li>2 bottle mounts inside front triangle (M-XL)</li>\n<li>carbon frame only; C30, C70, and C99 spec at launch, C50 and C90 to come in 2025</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>See more at <a href=\"https://bikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rocky Mountain</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2025-rocky-mountain-element-first-ride-review/\">2025 Rocky Mountain Element: First Ride Review</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Morgan Taylor","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"71bd0a359711d0253801fb9d931ea995ed415bd461e2f0401970bfe38c054e8c","category":"Cycling"}
