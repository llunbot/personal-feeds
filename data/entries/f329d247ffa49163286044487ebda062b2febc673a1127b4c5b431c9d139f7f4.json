Lawyers accused the US of a \"troubling\" and \"classic rush to judgment,\" claiming that the government didn't even wait to receive \"millions of documents\" and \"other evidence\" against Bankman-Fried before \"improperly seeking\" to turn \"civil and regulatory issues into federal crimes.\"</p>\n<p>After FTX's collapse last year, federal prosecutors acted quickly to intervene, within a month alleging that Bankman-Fried was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/sam-bankman-fried-took-2-2-billion-in-payments-and-loans-ftx-tells-court/\">stealing billions in customer funds</a>, defrauding investors, committing bank and wire fraud, providing improper loans, misleading lenders, transmitting money without a license, making illegal campaign contributions, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/sbf-paid-40m-bribe-to-unfreeze-crypto-trading-accounts-in-china-us-charges/\">bribing China officials</a>, and other crimes. Through it all, Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty. Now, in his motion to dismiss, Bankman-Fried has requested an oral argument to \"fight these baseless charges\" and \"clear his name.\" He's asking the court to dismiss 10 out of 13 charges, arguing that federal prosecutors have failed to substantiate most of their claims.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937826#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937826&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f329d247ffa49163286044487ebda062b2febc673a1127b4c5b431c9d139f7f4","category":"Tech"}
