There have also been many complaint threads from Lowe's customers about the lack of ‌Apple Pay‌ <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Lowes/comments/1005132/apple_pay/\">on Reddit</a> and the <em>MacRumors</em> forums.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLowe's has more than 2,000 stores in the United States, making it the second largest home improvement store after Home Depot. Accepting ‌Apple Pay‌ could lure customers to Lowe's over Home Depot, as Home Depot does not accept the payment technology at this time.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134\">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/26/lowes-apple-pay/\">Lowe's Retail Stores Now Accept Apple Pay</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lowes-retail-stores-now-accept-apple-pay.2414712/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2a98bc110db42d4b8cb06aa2ddaba998a42d1c3a509d5f750e323169ede20dd4","category":"Apple"}
