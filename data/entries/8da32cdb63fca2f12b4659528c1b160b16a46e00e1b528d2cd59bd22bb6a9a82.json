Apple was the first company to utilize TSMC's initial <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/\">3nm</a> technology with the A17 Pro chip in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max, and the company is likely to follow suit with the chipmaker's 2nm chips. With production set to begin in 2025, 2nm chips are likely to make their first appearance in Apple devices soon after.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast month, the <em>Financial Times</em> reported that TSMC had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/tsmc-demos-next-gen-chip-technology/\">already demonstrated</a> prototype 2nm chips to Apple ahead of their expected introduction in 2025. Apple is said to be closely aligned with TSMC in the race to develop and implement 2nm chip technology, which will surpass their current ‌3nm‌ chips and associated nodes in terms of transistor density, performance, and efficiency.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nToday, <em><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a></em> added that the chip supplier is also believed to be evaluating which of its plants will be the first to produce even <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/14/tsmc-mentions-highly-advanced-1-4nm-chips/\">more advanced 1.4nm chips</a> in 2027. The company began mass production of its enhanced ‌3nm‌ node, which is likely to appear in Apple devices for the first time later this year, in the fourth quarter of 2023.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/\">TSMC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/15/next-gen-chip-technology-on-track-for-2025/\">Next-Gen Apple Chip Technology on Track to Reach Production in 2025</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-gen-apple-chip-technology-on-track-to-reach-production-in-2025.2416379/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8da32cdb63fca2f12b4659528c1b160b16a46e00e1b528d2cd59bd22bb6a9a82","category":"Apple"}
