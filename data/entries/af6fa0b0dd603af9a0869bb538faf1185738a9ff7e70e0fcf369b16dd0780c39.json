This time it’s about the display—and reportedly Samsung won’t make them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to ZDNet Korea (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.ithome.com/0/758/418.htm&amp;xcust=1-1-2282807-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">via ITHome</a>), Samsung has declined the opportunity to supply Apple with iPhone SE 4 displays due to price issues.

The latest iPhone SE rumors claim the next model will be a dramatic redesign that dumps the Home button and adopts an all-screen design. It’s also expected to get Face ID and a newer processor, but most reports claim it will still have a single camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Samsung out of the picture, Chinese company BOE is the front-runner as the display supplier for the iPhone SE.
