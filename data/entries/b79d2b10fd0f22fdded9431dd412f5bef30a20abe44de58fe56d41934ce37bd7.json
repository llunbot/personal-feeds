If you’re  riding a bike that you wish wasn’t quite as steep to better tackle tougher trails, a 9point8 Slack-R Get Slack-R headset might just be the ticket to getting slacker…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>9point8 Slack-R ZS &amp; EC angle adjust headsets</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years ago, Canadian component maker <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=9point8\" target=\"_blank\">9point8</a> launched the first angle-adjustable headset that worked on bikes with IS Integrated headset cups. That original thread-together affair worked by relocating your existing IS bearings above &amp; below your headtube, into new eccentric offset cups that sat in the old bearing races. Now, riders of bikes that have Zero Stack headsets – where alloy cups are first pressed into your frame, with their own pressed-in bearings – can get the same slacker Slack-R conversion, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What do you need to know?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_standards-sizes.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_standards-sizes.jpg\" alt=\"9point8 Slack-R Zero Stack angle adjust headset ZS/EC standsrds\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_standards-sizes.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_standards-sizes-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_standards-sizes-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_standards-sizes-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_standards-sizes-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_standards-sizes-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_standards-sizes-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Images/9point8)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern tapered press-in headsets come in essentially 2 varieties – Zero Stack (ZS) where you don’t really see the cups and External Cup (EC) where you do. The 9point8 Slack-R headset solution again works by moving the bearings of your headset, outside of the headtube and offset a few millimeters from the centerline to effectively change your headtube angle. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_effect-of-headtube-length.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_effect-of-headtube-length.jpg\" alt=\"9point8 Slack-R Zero Stack angle adjust headset ZS/EC, impact of headtube length\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_effect-of-headtube-length.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_effect-of-headtube-length-297x165.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_effect-of-headtube-length-800x444.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_effect-of-headtube-length-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_effect-of-headtube-length-768x427.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_effect-of-headtube-length-1536x853.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>impact of headtube length on effective headtube angle change</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing so results in between a 0.8-2.8° slacker head angle. (<em>Or the same amount steeper if you want to go that direction.</em>) It is dependent on headtube length, so shorter headtubes will see more dramatic changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Swapping in the external cups means a taller combined stack height of your headset. So, it’s important you have a spacer or two you can pull out from under your stem. Lest your steerer tube be too short. It will also most likely raise your headtube by up to 10mm, increasing frame Stack. And in addition to slackening your headtube, it will also increase fork Trail a bit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quite a bit of small geometry changes will take place. But that’s why you want to give it a try, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want more of a geo change explanation, 9point8 offers <a href=\"https://9point8.ca/blogs/9point8-technology/a-deeper-look-into-the-9point8%E2%84%A2-slack-r%E2%84%A2\" target=\"_blank\">a deeper look at their Slack-R system, <em>here</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_rendering.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_rendering.jpg\" alt=\"9point8 Slack-R Zero Stack angle adjust headset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_rendering.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_rendering-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_rendering-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_rendering-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_rendering-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_rendering-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9point8-Slack-R-ZS-zero-stack-EC-angle-adjust-headset_rendering-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>9point8 calls the Slack-R design “creak-free”, made with machined 6061 aluminum cups and sealed stainless cartridge bearings.
