Scale it up to farm-sized jobs, and it becomes a nightmare. The most efficient industrial alternative, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/caddis-vol2/herbicides\">herbicides</a>, have potentially devastating side effects for people, animals, and the <a href=\"https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/widely-used-weed-killer-harming-biodiversity-320906\">environment</a>. So a Swedish company named <a href=\"https://www.ekobot.se/\">Ekobot AB</a> has introduced a wheeled robot that can autonomously recognize and pluck weeds from the ground rapidly using metal fingers.</p>\n\n<p>The four-wheeled <a href=\"https://www.ekobot.se/products/ekobot-weai/\">Ekobot WEAI robot</a> is battery-powered and can operate 10â€“12 hours a day on one charge. It weighs 600 kg (about 1322 pounds) and has a top speed of 5 km/h (2.5 mph). It's tuned for weeding fields full of onions, beetroots, carrots, or similar vegetables, and it can cover about 10 hectares (about 24.7 acres) in a day. It navigates using GPS <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_kinematic_positioning\">RTK</a> and contains safety sensors and vision systems to prevent it from unintentionally bumping into objects or people.</p>\n<figure>\n    <div>\n            </div>\n    </figure>\n<p>To pinpoint plants it needs to pluck, the Ekobot uses an AI-powered machine vision system trained to identify weeds as it rolls above the farm field. Once the weeds are within its sights, the robot uses a series of metal fingers to quickly dig up and push weeds out of the dirt. Ekobot claims that in trials, its weed-plucking robot allowed farmers to grow onions with 70 percent fewer pesticides. The weed recognition system is key because it keeps the robot from accidentally digging up crops by mistake.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983392#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983392&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"74948adcabf50956bb77b3e1fdf10558a8b5c3a2ae5f96c793e38f0c56474697","category":"Tech"}
