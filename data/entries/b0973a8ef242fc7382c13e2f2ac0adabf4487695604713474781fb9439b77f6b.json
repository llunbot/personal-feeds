A spokesperson for Sierra Space told Ars the spaceplane's launch is scheduled for the third or fourth quarter of this year.</p>\n<p>But Sierra Space will transport the Dream Chaser to NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida with a to-do list. There are two more significant tests the spacecraft must complete at the launch site. Technicians must also finish work on Dream Chaser's heat shield before it is ready to go on top of its Vulcan launcher. It's unclear how long these activities will take to complete.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023334#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023334&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b0973a8ef242fc7382c13e2f2ac0adabf4487695604713474781fb9439b77f6b","category":"Tech"}
