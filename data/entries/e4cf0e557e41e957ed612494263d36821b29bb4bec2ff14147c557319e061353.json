{"title":"Sports Tech Week in Review – March 24th, 2024","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/03/week-review-march.html","date":1711301335000,"content":"<p><img title=\"WeekInReview-Roundup.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/03/WeekInReview-Roundup-1.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"479\" /></p>\n<p>The Week in Review is a collection of both all the goodness I’ve written during the past week around the internet, as well as a small pile of links I found interesting – generally endurance sports related. I’ve often wondered what to do with all of the coolness that people write, and while I share a lot of it on Twitter/X and Facebook, this is a better forum for sending it on to y’all. Most times these different streams don’t overlap, so be on the lookout at all these places for good stuff!</p>\n<p>So with that, let’s get into the action!</p>\n<h3><strong>DCR Posts In The Past Week:</strong></h3>\n<p>Here’s all the latest on the site:</p>\n<p><b>Monday: </b><a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/03/apple-fitness-studios-behind-the-scenes-detailed.html\">Apple Fitness+ Studios Behind the Scenes: From Start to Finish</a><br />\n<strong>Wednesday:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/03/polar-grit-x2-pro-details-hands-everything.html\">Polar Grit X2 Pro Hands-On: Here’s Everything New!</a><br />\n<strong>Thursday:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/03/stravas-expands-cycling.html\">Strava Expands Cycling Best Efforts, and Starts Pushing Routes to All Polar Devices</a><br />\n<strong>Friday: </strong><a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/03/polar-gritx2-pricing-strava-vs-komoot-routes.html\">FIT File: Strava vs Komoot Routes, Let’s Talk Grit X2 Pricing</a></p>\n<h3><strong>Spring Sports Tech Deals:</strong></h3>\n<p>There’s a slate of new sports tech deals, primarily from Garmin, but also a few other companies jumping in on a spring-themed Amazon sale. Garmin seems to have some of the best deals here, though, the others aren’t too bad at all!</p>\n<p></p><table>\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th></th><th><span>Product</span></th><th><span>Sale Price</span></th><th><span>Amazon</span></th><th><span>Sale Notes</span></th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HOVERAir-X1-Self-Flying-Pocket-Sized-Intelligent/dp/B0CDC9VGVQ?crid=2U5PA2TU5RJX6&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.g_stw7EFZYuE4FnGZ1-Rv8Bo78xTHwsHngfc_q5VknwZ-fQmak5M7H2UEm5EM-tewo5ZGZzrTh18oJRdJ2Vu3-tmMv-5EwA0sasV9tUMqQDPu7f0FNgpRhvZC6kcebd_WuKDoKhyKlqq8NAoQkkNia8LcUF0M8Skh7YynegCPBZ5PhMJuYK-4BxQMSztEDyYJnF_U7vpcHBH9_dldFFzWnP-We6sxMETzHi1faFlQ0-jN_w_pVjeYKDEqF1vPU4fNZfdQquBwgwRHWekfHDPyUlJUWfvXFgUCaR614OwiTI.ZjXLZ5kPDk-SFhxj8iHkLv-AHUIJ0qkq3A40ewz8Ef0&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=hover%2Bx1&amp;qid=1711654232&amp;sprefix=hover%2Bx%2Caps%2C229&amp;sr=8-2&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dcr07-20&amp;linkId=4fa6bae77b30e8c3c8a7ff2d4324ed89&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"111\" height=\"125\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/03/HoverX1NoBackground-111x125.png\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/03/HoverX1NoBackground-111x125.png 111w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/03/HoverX1NoBackground-200x225.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/03/HoverX1NoBackground-720x811.png 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/03/HoverX1NoBackground.png 1332w\" /></a></td><td>HoverAir X1 Drone - $80 off!</td><td>$349</td><td><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HOVERAir-X1-Self-Flying-Pocket-Sized-Intelligent/dp/B0CDC9VGVQ?crid=2U5PA2TU5RJX6&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.g_stw7EFZYuE4FnGZ1-Rv8Bo78xTHwsHngfc_q5VknwZ-fQmak5M7H2UEm5EM-tewo5ZGZzrTh18oJRdJ2Vu3-tmMv-5EwA0sasV9tUMqQDPu7f0FNgpRhvZC6kcebd_WuKDoKhyKlqq8NAoQkkNia8LcUF0M8Skh7YynegCPBZ5PhMJuYK-4BxQMSztEDyYJnF_U7vpcHBH9_dldFFzWnP-We6sxMETzHi1faFlQ0-jN_w_pVjeYKDEqF1vPU4fNZfdQquBwgwRHWekfHDPyUlJUWfvXFgUCaR614OwiTI.ZjXLZ5kPDk-SFhxj8iHkLv-AHUIJ0qkq3A40ewz8Ef0&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=hover%2Bx1&amp;qid=1711654232&amp;sprefix=hover%2Bx%2Caps%2C229&amp;sr=8-2&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dcr07-20&amp;linkId=4fa6bae77b30e8c3c8a7ff2d4324ed89&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a></td><td>Note: There's virtually always a $80 coupon that can be clicked on the Amazon page.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n<h3><strong>YouTube Videos This Past Week:</strong></h3>\n<p>Here’s what hit the tubes over on the You of Tube, definitely don’t forget to subscribe there to get notified of videos the second they hit!</p>\n<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>Stuff I Found Interesting Around The Interwebs:</strong></h3>\n<p>Here’s a not-so-small smattering of all the random things that I stumbled on while doing my civic duty to find the end of the Internet:</p>\n<p>1) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4H3dRXEeeA\">Wahoo ELEMNT/BOLT series now has dark mode:</a> Check out GPLAMA’s video for all the details:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>2) <a href=\"https://cyclingindustry.news/wahoo-renaissance-continues-with-new-ceo-appointment/\">Wahoo also has a new CEO:</a> </strong>While I got the press release, it looks like no other outlet covered it except this one. While I somewhat wish that the new CEO would have come from within the sports realm, or sports tech realm, at least he’s a cyclist and runner (and apparently smart enough not to get suckered into swimming, the gateway to triathlon). As always, I’ll give him a fair shake and see how things cook over the next year. Sometimes an outside perspective works, sometimes not. Really just depends on the company and situation.</p>\n<p><strong>3) <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/22/24107984/apple-watch-smartwatch-ecosystems\">Smartwatches shouldn’t make you choose between Apple &amp; Android:</a></strong> Obviously, lots of discussion this weekend on the US vs Apple case. In fact, a portion of that is focused on the ability for 3rd party smartwatches (e.g., Garmin/Polar/Suunto/COROS/etc…) to access certain features, which are today blocked (like responding to text messages). In any case, this piece from Victoria at The Verge is a good look at the situation as it pertains to watches.</p>\n<p><strong>4) <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=288776680931191\">New iGPSport iGS800 Cycling GPS Computer:</a> </strong>A couple of people have asked about this new unit, and whether I’ll review it. I’m kinda on the fence. Historically when I’ve tried some of iGPSport’s devices (similar to Bryton), they tend to have good hardware specs, but usually are pretty rough on the software front. In some ways, the company’s introduction of this device follows that. While announced on Facebook, no mention of the device exists on their <a href=\"https://www.igpsport.com/news\">own company site</a> (either in news section, or product section).</p>\n<p><strong>5) <a href=\"https://dronedj.com/2023/03/07/snow-stuck-phone-drone-rescue/\">Man ties phone to drone, to get rescue in snowy mountains:</a> </strong>After being trapped for two days, the man tied his phone to a DJI Mavic 3, sent a message, and then took off to (hopefully) get within range. It worked, and SAR crews quickly got to him. Like I always say: Travel with a drone or three.</p>\n<p><strong>6) <a href=\"https://www.hammerhead.io/blogs/change-logs/karoo-software-build-version-1-457-1794\">Hammerhead revamps structured workout on Karoo:</a></strong> Along with adding Italian support, they’ve increased the granularity of the trainer control bits. Thus, Italian trainer users have two reasons to celebrate this week.</p>\n<p><strong>7) </strong><a href=\"https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/red-light-green-light-is-now-available-to-all-trainerroad-athletes/91907\"><strong>TrainerRoad launches Red-Light-Green-Light to all athletes:</strong></a> I’ve been using this in beta the last little while, and it’s pretty cool – albeit a bit of a cut-down version of what you might see within some watches directly. I might write-up more on this, later this week, given said usage.</p>\n<p>–</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>","author":"DC Rainmaker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"e4cf0e557e41e957ed612494263d36821b29bb4bec2ff14147c557319e061353","category":"Cycling"}
