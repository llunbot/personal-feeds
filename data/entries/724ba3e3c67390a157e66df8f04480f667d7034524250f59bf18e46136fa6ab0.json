But I’ve put it to completely different use from my two previous products.</p>\n<p>During a 450km gravel traverse of Belgium, the Cinder Phantom Waterproof was worth its minimal weight in gold.</p>\n<p>In the August showers, I would have had to take a heavier <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-waterproof-jackets-for-cyclists/\">waterproof jacket</a> on and off to avoid boiling.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RAB Cinder Phantom Waterjacket repaired sleeve\" title=\"AM9A1172\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The repair to the sleeve hasn’t impacted the jacket’s waterproofing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Scott Windsor / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>But because the Cinder Phantom Waterproof Jacket is readily breathable and highly waterproof, it stopped me getting wet from sweat and rain. Once the sun emerged again, the outside seemed to dry in minutes.</p>\n<p>The relaxed fit is well suited to minimalist bikepacking – it’s not too racy to wear off the bike, so you don’t need to take an extra jacket for the evening.</p>\n<p>The sleeve of the RAB Cinder Phantom Waterproof ripped on a thorny section of singletrack. However, through RAB’s repair scheme, which you’ll be able to use too, I got it patched up.</p>\n<p>Post-repair, the jacket performs as well as before.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Restrap 18L Saddle Pack</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Restrap 18L saddle pack on bike\" title=\"AM9A1156\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The stiff harness holds its contents really securely.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Scott Windsor / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£129.99 / $194.99 / €155.99</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Restrap 18L Saddle Pack is an antidote to the ills of less well-designed <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bikepacking-saddle-bags/\">saddle packs</a>, which swing disconcertingly under load.</p>\n<p>Unlike some <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bikepacking-bags/\">bikepacking bags</a>, it’s stable over rough stuff, including cobbles and technical singletrack.
