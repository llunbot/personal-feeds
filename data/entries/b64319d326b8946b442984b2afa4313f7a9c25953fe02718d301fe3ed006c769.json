Non-slip rubber has been fixed to the nose bridge and arm tips too. As for the lens, Adidas has used a plasstic brown lens with mirror shielf finish. </p>\n<p>The big benefit of using 3D printing is weight, with the complete set coming in at just 20 grams. </p>\n<p>Why are Adidas making 3D printed cycling sunglasses? Well it says doing so 'opens a new dialogue with professional athletes and creates a new opportunity for innovative trailblazers', one that is 'characterised by an ongoing search for high-performance lines and materials'.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/4798/the-best-books-about-cycling\">The best books about cycling</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/2104/vuelta-a-espana-route-race-reports-tv-guide-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Vuelta a Espana 2021: Route, start list, live TV guide and all we know so far</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/reviews/9281/the-road-book-2020-review\">The Road Book 2020 Review</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 117: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nNow if a set of sunglasses that make you look like a welder is your thing and you're interested in getting yourself a pair, unfortunately, you're fresh out of luck.
