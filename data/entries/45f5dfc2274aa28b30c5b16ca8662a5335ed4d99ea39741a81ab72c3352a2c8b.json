Ecologists, chemists, and biologists at Montlake Laboratory, the center’s headquarters in Seattle, are taking turns hauling garbage to the dumpster and discussing whether they should create a sign-up sheet to scrub toilets.</p>\n<p>The scientists—who conduct genetic sampling of endangered salmon to check the species’ stock status and survival—routinely work with chemicals that can burn skin, erupt into flames, and cause cancer. At least one said they’d have to delay mission-critical research if hazardous waste removal isn’t restored.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/noaa-scientists-scrub-toilets-rethink-experiments-after-service-contracts-end/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/noaa-scientists-scrub-toilets-rethink-experiments-after-service-contracts-end/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Lisa Song, ProPublica","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"45f5dfc2274aa28b30c5b16ca8662a5335ed4d99ea39741a81ab72c3352a2c8b","category":"Tech"}
