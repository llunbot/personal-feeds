Many of these scams are aimed at children and attempt to trick them into downloading apps, malware, or submitting personal details in exchange for nonexistent rewards in <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/fortnite/?page=1\"><em>Fortnite</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/roblox/\"><em>Roblox</em></a>.</p>\n<p>For more than three years, security researcher Zach Edwards has been tracking these website hijackings and scams. He says the activity can be linked back to the activities of affiliate users of one advertising company. The US-registered company acts as a service that sends web traffic to a range of online advertisers, allowing individuals to sign up and use its systems. However, on any given day, Edwards, a senior manager of threat insights at <a href=\"https://www.humansecurity.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Human Security</a>, uncovers scores of .gov, .org, and .edu domains being compromised. </p><div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png\" /></div>\n<p>“This group is what I would consider to be the number one group at bulk compromising infrastructure across the Internet and hosting scams on it and other types of exploits,” Edwards says. The scale of the website compromises—which are ongoing—and the public nature of the scams makes them stand out, the researcher says.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961085#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961085&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4ff9d6d9cc94a3fb17da8db05df7be8c05bf4704b9cc93365060846214b02886","category":"Tech"}
