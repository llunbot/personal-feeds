The symbol, created in collaboration with other industry players as part of the <a href=\"https://c2pa.org/\">Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity</a> (C2PA), aims to bring transparency to media creation and reduce the impact of misinformation or deepfakes online. Whether it will actually do so in practice is uncertain.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://contentcredentials.org/\">Content Credentials</a> symbol, which looks like a lowercase \"CR\" in a curved bubble with a right angle in the lower-right corner, reflects the presence of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata\">metadata</a> stored in a PDF, photo, or video file that includes information about the content's origin and the tools (both AI and conventional) used in its creation. The information is automatically added by <a href=\"https://www.nikon.com/company/news/2022/1019_exhibition_01.html\">supporting digital cameras</a> and AI image generator <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/adobes-ai-image-generators-get-beefy-updates-including-vector-graphics/\">Adobe Firefly</a>, or it can be inserted by Photoshop and Premiere. It will also soon be supported by Bing Image Creator.</p>\n<p>If credentialed media is presented in a compatible app or using a JavaScript wrapper on the web, users <a href=\"https://contentcredentials.org/\">click</a> the \"CR\" icon in the upper-right corner to view a drop-down menu containing image information. Or they can upload a file to a <a href=\"https://contentcredentials.org/verify\">special website</a> to read the metadata.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975166#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975166&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"447f48aceca04771dbff07ca07469ce83b718b720d0aacbd803ee111cfc6ed6b","category":"Tech"}
