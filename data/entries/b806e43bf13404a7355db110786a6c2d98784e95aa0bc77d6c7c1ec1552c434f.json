Connecting user accounts to third-party APIs always comes with the same plumbing: OAuth flows, token storage, refresh logic, and provider-specific quirks. WorkOS Pipes removes that overhead. Users connect services like GitHub, Slack, Google, Salesforce, and other supported providers through a drop-in widget. Your back end requests a valid access token from the Pipes API when needed, while Pipes handles credential storage and token refresh. That’s it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://workos.com/docs/pipes?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=q12026&amp;utm_content=simplify_integrations_cta\">Simplify your integrations with WorkOS Pipes</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/15/workos-pipes\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b806e43bf13404a7355db110786a6c2d98784e95aa0bc77d6c7c1ec1552c434f","category":"Tech"}
