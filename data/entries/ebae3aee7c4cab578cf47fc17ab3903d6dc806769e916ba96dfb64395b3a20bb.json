With only a few days remaining in the month, that means that assembly of the laptops has more likely than not already begun.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-mbp-space-black.jpg\" width=\"1440\" height=\"810\" />\r<br />\nThis information aligns with display industry analyst Ross Young claiming that display shipments for the next 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/15/m4-macbook-pro-panels-shipping/\">are underway</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a May edition of his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-12/who-will-run-apple-after-cook-leaves-a-look-at-company-s-succession-challenge-lw3j2t5z\"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said \"you should expect M4 Pro and M4 Max chips later this year as part of the high-end MacBook Pro.\" He also expects Apple to release <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/23/apple-testing-four-m4-macs/\">three new Macs with the standard M4 chip later this year</a>, including a lower-end 14-inch MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac mini. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nOctober is a common month for Apple to announce new Macs, including the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips last October. If that pattern repeats itself, the next 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips are likely around two months away from launching.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe standard M4 chip already debuted in the iPad Pro earlier this year, and Geekbench results showed it provided <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/m4-ipad-pro-cpu-benchmark/\">up to 25% faster multi-core CPU performance</a> compared to the M3 chip. Likewise, moderate year-over-year performance and power efficiency improvements can be expected from the M4 Pro and M4 Max chips.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo major design changes are expected for the next MacBook Pro models, with an OLED display in particular likely still a few years away for the laptops. Gurman said Apple is also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-plans-thinner-iphone-slimmer-macbook/\">planning to make the MacBook Pro thinner</a> at some point \"over the next couple of years.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's last Mac-focused event was held on October 30, 2023, and there is certainly potential for another October event this year.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 14 &amp; 16\" </a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/macbook-pro-m4-pro-m4-max-production-report/\">MacBook Pros With M4 Pro and M4 Max Chips Reportedly Being Mass Produced This Month</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-pros-with-m4-pro-and-m4-max-chips-reportedly-being-mass-produced-this-month.2434581/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ebae3aee7c4cab578cf47fc17ab3903d6dc806769e916ba96dfb64395b3a20bb","category":"Apple"}
