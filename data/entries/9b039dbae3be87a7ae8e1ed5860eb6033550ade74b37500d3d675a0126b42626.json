These homebrew scripts can loop, iterate, and spin off new instances of an AI model as needed.</p>\n\n<p>Two experimental open source projects, in particular, have captured much attention on social media, especially among those who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rowancheung/status/1646747370644709376?s=20\">hype</a> AI projects relentlessly:<a href=\"https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT\"> Auto-GPT</a>, created by <span>Toran Bruce Richards</span>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi\">BabyAGI</a>, created by <span>Yohei Nakajima</span>.</p>\n<p>What do they do? Well, right now, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bensauer/status/1643601912917262336\">not very much</a>. They need a lot of human input and hand-holding along the way, so they're not yet as autonomous as promised. But they represent early steps toward more complex chaining AI models that could potentially be more capable than a single AI model working alone.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929067#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929067&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9b039dbae3be87a7ae8e1ed5860eb6033550ade74b37500d3d675a0126b42626","category":"Tech"}
