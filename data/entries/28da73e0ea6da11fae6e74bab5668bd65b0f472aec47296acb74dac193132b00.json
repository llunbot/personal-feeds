{"title":"Reuters: U.S. State Department Employees‚Äô iPhones Were Hacked With NSO Group Spyware","link":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-us-state-department-phones-hacked-with-israeli-company-spyware-sources-2021-12-03/","date":1638584924000,"content":"\n<p>Christopher Bing and Joseph Menn, reporting for Reuters:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>iPhones of at least nine U.S. State Department employees were\nhacked by an unknown assailant using sophisticated spyware\ndeveloped by the Israel-based NSO Group, according to four people\nfamiliar with the matter. The hacks, which took place in the last\nseveral months, hit U.S. officials either based in Uganda or\nfocused on matters concerning the East African country, two of the\nsources said. [‚Ä¶]</p>\n\n<p>Apple‚Äôs alert to affected users did not name the creator of the\nspyware used in this hack. The victims notified by Apple included\nAmerican citizens and were easily identifiable as U.S. government\nemployees because they associated email addresses ending in\nstate.gov with their Apple IDs, two of the people said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fascinating to consider that the U.S. State Department is only aware of this hack because Apple notified the affected employees. That‚Äôs certainly how this report reads.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In a public response, NSO has said its technology helps stop\nterrorism and that they‚Äôve installed controls to curb spying\nagainst innocent targets. For example, NSO says its intrusion\nsystem cannot work on phones with U.S. numbers beginning with the\ncountry code +1. But in the Uganda case, the targeted State\nDepartment employees were using iPhones registered with foreign\ntelephone numbers, said two of the sources, without the U.S.\ncountry code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Big-time ‚úäüçÜ feel to this. Like hearing about PC malware that bypasses PCs with Russian keyboards attached.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/12/03/us-state-dept-iphones-nso-group\">¬†‚òÖ¬†</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"28da73e0ea6da11fae6e74bab5668bd65b0f472aec47296acb74dac193132b00","category":"Tech"}
