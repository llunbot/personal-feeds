The colors used in the artwork are picked from the album artwork of whatever song is first in the playlist. The default artwork continues to be the tiled album artwork of the first four songs in a playlist and the ability to choose a custom image from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> or Files remains.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPreviously, users had to keep the basic tiled image or upload a custom image. Since not all users have custom graphics or photos they want to use for playlists and the default artwork is relatively simple, playlists can be difficult to identify and look fairly generic. Now, users can quickly and easily set a unique appearance for each playlist that fits in with ‌Apple Music‌'s UI.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther ‌Apple Music‌ changes and improvements in iOS 17.1 include favoriting songs from the Lock Screen and suggested songs in playlists. The ability for multiple users to collaborate on and add to the same playlist and ‌Apple Music‌ SharePlay for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a> are also expected to be added in a future update. iOS 17.1 introduces a host of new features, including NameDrop to Apple Watch, UK <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/view-uk-bank-account-balance-apple-wallet/\">bank balances in the Wallet app</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/ios-17-1-beta-1-features/\">more</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/custom-apple-music-playlist-art-options/\">iOS 17.1 Adds Custom Playlist Art Options to Apple Music</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-1-adds-custom-playlist-art-options-to-apple-music.2405286/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e6cc8696bbcf9d7fdbaa419bca3dd92401235ce22cdf3890c7c57ce20241dedf","category":"Apple"}
