Today the company has <a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/19/celebrating-30-years-of-playstation-with-a-nostalgic-look/\">announced</a> limited-edition versions of both the PS5 and PS5 Pro with gray plastic shells and multicolored PlayStation logos, inspired by the gray plastic shells of the original. The retro-inspired modern consoles will be released on November 21 and will be available for preorder starting September 26 from <a href=\"https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/\">Sony's direct.playstation.com</a> site.</p>\n\n<p>Sony is also releasing DualSense and DualSense Edge controllers with gray shells and colorful PS logo buttons and a gray version of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/sonys-200-handheld-portal-can-stream-games-from-your-ps5-and-uh-thats-it/\">Switch-esque PlayStation Portal streaming console</a>. Sony says that the limited-edition PS5 Pro will be limited to 12,300 units—a reference to the December 3 launch date—but didn't mention any specific manufacturing numbers for the regular PS5, either DualSense controller design, or the PlayStation Portal.</p>\n<p>Both console bundles also come with a handful of other accessories: a PS logo sticker, a PS logo paperclip, cable ties, and (my personal favorite) a regular USB-C cable with a giant, chunky PS1-style controller connector on one end.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051005#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051005&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"43023c8ee581bd6fa5001f104e6733a51b683829792aa702a2450c7e02869e1a","category":"Tech"}
