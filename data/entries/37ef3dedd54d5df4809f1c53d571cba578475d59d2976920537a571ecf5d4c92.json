When I test this out, I see suggestions for certain words in the QuickType bar where other suggestions appear. However, my older kid has them dropped in–something other people have complained about in online forums since the feature’s introduction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a way to disable this in iOS and iPadOS. Not, unfortunately, with a switch marked Disable Text Effects. Instead, go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Keyboards</em>, scroll to <em>All Keyboards</em>, and disable <em>Predictive Text</em>. This removes all attempts at providing options based on your typing, though it doesn’t disable the often-inaccurate Auto-Correction, which you can turn off in the same section.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-excited-text-effect-bordered.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-excited-text-effect-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1183w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-excited-text-effect-bordered.png?resize=300%2C127&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-excited-text-effect-bordered.png?resize=768%2C326&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"435\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Apple really wants you to use its perplexing Text Effects animations.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It used to be rare that Apple would force new features on us that we didn’t expect, like a spider dropping from a ceiling onto our clothes. The not-very-useful Text Effects should have a way to prevent their insertion or suggestion, leaving them for people who explicitly want to use them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Ben.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
