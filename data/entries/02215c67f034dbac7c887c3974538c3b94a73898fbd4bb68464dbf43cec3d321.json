They have been designed to roll on a more modern wheel diameter; 27.5″ wheels with 2.2″ tires. They also feature a modular dropout system that can take inserts for through axle (142 x 12), QR 135mm or horizontal SS/Fixed also at 135mm. Stayer notes at some point soon there will be a UDH insert.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Stayer_stAyTB-7.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Stayer_stAyTB-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Stayer_stAyTB-7.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Stayer_stAyTB-7.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Stayer_stAyTB-7.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Other specs on the frames include ISO disc brakes, seatpost is 27.2 mm, attached via a fastback with removable threaded boss, the headtube is for 1 1/8″ straight steerer forks designed around an axle-to-crown of 395mm, M5 bosses for racks and fenders.</p>\n<p><strong>Pricing and Lead Times</strong></p>\n<p>Initial orders for everything else will be delivered in October and then stock shall show on the website and be periodically replenished.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Stayer_stAyTB-2.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Stayer_stAyTB-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Stayer_stAyTB-2.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Stayer_stAyTB-2.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Stayer_stAyTB-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stayercycles.com/the-staytb/\" target=\"_blank\">Frame</a> – £1300 inc Tax</p>\n<p>Batch 1 pre order special £1200<br />\nThe initial pre-orderable batch is for Small, Medium and Large in rAwrAw house finish only.
