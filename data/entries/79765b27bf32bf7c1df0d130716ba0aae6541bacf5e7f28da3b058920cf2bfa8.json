{"title":"Introducing Flow Collective: MTB Jerseys With An Artistic Twist","link":"https://bikerumor.com/flow-collective-jerseys/","date":1680188400000,"content":"<p>Christopher Stirrup went into the Covid-19 pandemic as a biomedical scientist and came out the other side wanting “something creative.” A lifelong mountain biker, it didn’t take Stirrup long to turn his riding hobby into <a href=\"https://www.flowcollective.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Flow Collective</a>: a mountain bike apparel company with a strong focus on community and artist collaboration. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of this writing, there’s only one <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/mission-workshop-adds-range-jersey-to-acre-italian-made-line/\" target=\"_blank\">jersey</a> design on the website, a collaboration with artist and bike designer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hasie_and_the_robots/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Hasie and the Robots</a>. The design comes in three colorways (marigold/cream, purple/blue, and blue/grey) that start out saturated at the lower hem and fade to more neutral tones as the eye travels up the torso. A cacophony of scribbled-style doodles and bold lines adorn the sleeves and back. Each color scheme has socks to match (purchased separately). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/flow-2.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/flow-2-800x450.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/flow-2-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/flow-2-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/flow-2-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/flow-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/flow-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/flow-2-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/flow-2-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/flow-2.jpg 1920w\" /></a><figcaption>Flow Collective’s first drop: a collab with artist Hasie and the Robots. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stirrup takes the “community” aspect of his company seriously.
