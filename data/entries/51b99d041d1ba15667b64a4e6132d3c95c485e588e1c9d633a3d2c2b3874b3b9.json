Apple says this feature \"makes it easy to navigate, write, sketch, and illustrate with greater precision\" on the latest 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/iWork-Trio-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nThe latest iPad Pro models can detect the second-generation Apple Pencil while it hovers up to 12mm above the display, allowing users to preview their drawing before they make it. And for the Scribble feature, which converts handwriting to text on the iPad, text fields automatically expand when the Apple Pencil is hovered over the screen. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Pencil hover gained tilt and azimuth support with iPadOS 16.4, released earlier this week. Apple discussed the feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/27/ipados-16-4-apple-pencil-hover/\">in a recent interview</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPages, Numbers, and Keynote received a few other improvements on both iOS and macOS, including bug fixes and the ability to export and send a copy of a document, spreadsheet, or presentation in a different format from the Share menu. The updates are available for free on the App Store and Mac App Store.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iwork/\">iWork</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/pages/\">Pages</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/keynote/\">Keynote</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/numbers/\">Numbers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139\">iPad Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/30/pages-numbers-keynote-apple-pencil-hover/\">Pages, Numbers, and Keynote Apps for iPad Now Support Apple Pencil Hover</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/pages-numbers-and-keynote-apps-for-ipad-now-support-apple-pencil-hover.2385366/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"51b99d041d1ba15667b64a4e6132d3c95c485e588e1c9d633a3d2c2b3874b3b9","category":"Apple"}
