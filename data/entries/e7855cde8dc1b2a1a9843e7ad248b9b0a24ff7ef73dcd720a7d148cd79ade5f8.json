The rage is typically justified. Over the past several years, Apple has given us largely tweaked iterations of the same device. Nevertheless, these small improvements do add up to meaningful year-over-year upgrades, but it’s been a while since Apple has truly blown us away</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s iPhone 17 lineup could follow the same pattern. We’re not expecting groundbreaking additions such as a foldable display or a portless design, but rumors hint at a slew of welcome changes across the line. Regardless of the model you’re using right now, here are 10 main reasons you will want to buy an iPhone 17 this fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. All-new Air variant</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most noticeable introduction will be the iPhone 17 Air. Apple is reportedly working on an ultra-thin phone that sacrifices some high-end specs in favor of sleeker aesthetics. With a rumored thinness of around 5.5mm, the Air model will easily dethrone the 6.9mm iPhone 6 as Apple’s thinnest smartphone ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it will likely sport a single camera like the iPhone 16e, the 17 Air edition is expected to still bring several high-end features, including support for MagSafe accessories, the Dynamic Island, the Camera Control button, and possibly even an always-on display. It’s the closest thing to a new design we’ve gotten in years, and the iPhone 17 Air will appeal to customers looking for something different.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Sharper selfie camera</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t really care about the Air edition, there are still plenty of other upgrades planned for the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max. For starters, all four models are expected to feature a 24MP TrueDepth camera system, a notable jump from the 12MP lens available on the last several generations. This upgrade will dramatically improve the quality of your selfies and possibly enable 2X zoom while maintaining image sharpness.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-titanium-frame.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"person holding an iphone 16 pro showing the back camera\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-titanium-frame.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-titanium-frame.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-titanium-frame.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-titanium-frame.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-titanium-frame.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-titanium-frame.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-titanium-frame.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-titanium-frame.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The iPhone 16 Pro could get a major camera upgrade.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Main camera upgrades</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The newest iPhones always have better cameras, and the iPhone 17 will be no exception. Most notably, the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max could finally adopt a 48MP telephoto lens, making faraway shots even sharper and enabling even better digital zoom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the ultrawide lens could gain a variable aperture, letting you decide how much light passes through. This would elevate mobile photography by giving users more control over the depth of field. However, it’s possible that this feature gets pushed to the iPhone 18 in 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond that, the highest-end models could gain 8K video shooting capabilities for the first time, luring content creators who’d rather not carry a dedicated camera around.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Reimagined camera bump</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>iPhone camera upgrades are usually limited to spec bumps, but this year’s models are also expected to adopt a fresh exterior design. For starters, the all-new iPhone 17 Air is expected to feature a new look with a horizontal bar to house its single wide lens, differentiating it from the entry-level 16e.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, Apple may stretch the iPhone 17 Pro models’ camera bump across the back as well, departing from the classic square design. The back of the iPhone has generally looked the same ever since the iPhone 11, so an overhauled look will set the upcoming Pro iPhones apart from their predecessors.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mahmoud-Itani-shooting-with-an-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Person shooting with an iPhone 16 Pro Max\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mahmoud-Itani-shooting-with-an-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mahmoud-Itani-shooting-with-an-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mahmoud-Itani-shooting-with-an-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mahmoud-Itani-shooting-with-an-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mahmoud-Itani-shooting-with-an-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mahmoud-Itani-shooting-with-an-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mahmoud-Itani-shooting-with-an-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mahmoud-Itani-shooting-with-an-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The entire iPhone lineup could have new camera designs.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Aluminum frame revival</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For nearly a decade, Apple has distinguished its flagship iPhones by offering distinct metallic chassis. The strategy was kickstarted by the iPhone X, offering a stainless steel frame as the iPhone 8 stuck to aluminum. Lower-end iPhones continued to feature the same aluminum frame, while Pro models eventually switched to titanium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later this year, Apple could switch things up by using aluminum bodies across the entire iPhone 17 line. This shift could make the Pro models lighter, as titanium is significantly denser. Apart from that, the company could mix aluminum with the back glass to increase its durability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6. In-house wireless chips</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the iPhone 16e, Apple introduced its first 5G chip, delivering comparable performance using less energy. The first-party modem could make its way to the iPhone 17 Air later this year, which would improve its energy efficiency. Similarly, all iPhone 17 models could pack an Apple-made Wi-Fi chipset, potentially increasing their battery life.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-5G-connectivity.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 16 Pro Max 5G connectivity\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-5G-connectivity.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-5G-connectivity.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-5G-connectivity.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-5G-connectivity.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-5G-connectivity.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-5G-connectivity.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-5G-connectivity.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-5G-connectivity.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Apple might switch to new wireless chips that are more efficient.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>7. RAM boost</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the launch of the iPhone 16, Apple boosted the standard models to 8GB of RAM to support on-device Apple Intelligence features, matching the 8GB in the Pro models. To set its high-end phones apart, Apple is rumored to equip the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max with 12GB of RAM—a 50 percent increase over the current specs. Beyond more powerful AI tools, the upgrade could make apps snappier and practically eliminate lag across the system.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8. Improved thermal management</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After the iPhone 15 Pro’s overheating issues, the iPhone 16 Pro adopted an enhanced thermal management system. To help maintain the phone’s neutral temperature, the iPhone 17 Pro models could go one step further with a vapor chamber cooling technology. A special liquid would dissipate in a vacuum space when subjected to heat, which then distributes it across a wider area, keeping things cool in the most stressful conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>9. Longer battery life</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The homegrown Wi-Fi chip and vapor chamber cooling may not be the only factors improving battery life. The iPhone 17 Pro models could have a thicker design for the first time in years, presumably to accommodate larger batteries. Consequently, iPhone 17 Pro users could be able to go through a full day of heavy use without having to worry about charging.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-Dynamic-Island.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 16 Pro Max Dynamic Island\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-Dynamic-Island.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-Dynamic-Island.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-Dynamic-Island.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-Dynamic-Island.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-Dynamic-Island.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-Dynamic-Island.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-Dynamic-Island.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-Dynamic-Island.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The non-Pro iPhone 17 models might get ProMotion displays for the first time.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>10. Superior displays</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, all iPhone 17 models could adopt the ProMotion technology, finally unlocking 120Hz variable refresh rates for all users. Currently exclusive to Pro models since 2021, the addition would let iPhone 17 and 17 Air users finally enjoy smoother scrolling and transitions throughout iOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the four displays could feature a more scratch-resistant coating to better withstand sharp objects. There have also been mixed rumors about a smaller Dynamic Island on the iPhone 17 Pro Max, but it’s unclear if it’ll actually materialize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There’s still room for innovation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smartphones have undoubtedly matured, and annual refreshes have arguably become redundant. Despite that, every once in a while, Apple manages to squeeze in enough hardware boosts in a single launch, enticing users to upgrade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s especially exciting about this year’s rumored iPhone line is how there are remarkable changes impacting each of the four variants—not just the highest-end ones. While the vanilla iPhone 17 may be the least interesting, there’s a lot to look forward to in the Air, Pro, and Pro Max models.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e7855cde8dc1b2a1a9843e7ad248b9b0a24ff7ef73dcd720a7d148cd79ade5f8","category":"Apple"}
