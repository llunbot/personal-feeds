It works by generating seismic waves that travel into the ground, reﬂect oﬀ various rock layers and structures, and return to the surface where they’re detected by sensitive instruments known as geophones or hydrophones. The huge volumes of acquired data often reach petabytes for a single survey and this presents signiﬁcant storage, processing, and management challenges for researchers and energy companies.</p> \n<p>Customers who run these seismic imaging workloads or other <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/\">high performance computing (HPC)</a> workloads, such as weather forecasting, advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) training, or genomics analysis, already store the huge volumes of data on either hard disk drive (HDD)-based or a combination of HDD and solid state drive (SSD) file storage on premises. However, as these on premises datasets and workloads scale, customers find it increasingly challenging and expensive due to the need to make upfront capital investments to keep up with performance needs of their workloads and avoid running out of storage capacity.</p> \n<p>Today, we’re announcing the general availability of the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/lustre/\">Amazon FSx for Lustre Intelligent-Tiering</a>, a new storage class that delivers virtually unlimited scalability, the only fully elastic Lustre ﬁle storage, and the lowest cost Lustre file storage in the cloud. With a starting price of less than $0.005 per GB-month, FSx for Lustre Intelligent-Tiering oﬀers the lowest cost high-performance file storage in the cloud, reducing storage costs for infrequently accessed data by up to 96 percent compared to other managed Lustre options. Elasticity means you no longer need to provision storage capacity upfront because your file system will grow and shrink as you add or delete data, and you pay only for the amount of data you store.</p> \n<p>FSx for Lustre Intelligent-Tiering automatically optimizes costs by tiering cold data to the applicable lower-cost storage tier based on access patterns and includes an optional SSD read cache to improve performance for your most latency sensitive workloads. Intelligent-Tiering delivers high performance whether you’re starting with gigabytes of experimental data or working with large petabyte-scale datasets for your most demanding <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/training/learn-about/machine-learning/\">artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)</a> and HPC workloads. With the flexibility to adjust your file system’s performance independent of storage, Intelligent-Tiering delivers up to 34 percent better price performance than on premises HDD file systems. The Intelligent-Tiering storage class is optimized for HDD-based or mixed HDD/SSD workloads that have a combination of hot and cold data. You can migrate and run such workloads to FSx for Lustre Intelligent-Tiering without application changes, eliminating storage capacity planning and management, while paying only for the resources that you use.</p> \n<p>Prior to this launch, customers used the FSx for Lustre SSD storage class to accelerate ML and HPC workloads that need all-SSD performance and consistent low-latency access to all data. However, many workloads have a combination of hot and cold data and they don’t need all-SSD storage for colder portions of the data. FSx for Lustre is increasingly used in AI/ML workloads to increase graphics processing unit (GPU) utilization, and now it’s even more cost optimized to be one of the options for these workloads.</p> \n<p><span><strong>FSx for Lustre Intelligent-Tiering<br /> </strong></span>Your data moves between three storage tiers (Frequent Access, Infrequent Access, and Archive) with no effort on your part, so you get automatic cost savings with no upfront costs or commitments. The tiering works as follows:</p> \n<p><strong>Frequent Access</strong> – Data that has been accessed within the last 30 days is stored in this tier.</p> \n<p><strong>Infrequent Access</strong> – Data that hasn’t been accessed for 30 – 90 days is stored in this tier, at a 44 percent cost reduction from Frequent Access.</p> \n<p><strong>Archive</strong> – Data that hasn’t been accessed for 90 or more days is stored in this tier, at a 65 percent cost reduction compared to Infrequent Access.</p> \n<p>Regardless of the storage tier, your data is stored across multiple <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/\">AWS Availability Zones</a> for redundancy and availability, compared to typical on-premises implementations, which are usually confined within a single physical location. Additionally, your data can be retrieved instantly in milliseconds.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Creating a file system</strong></span><br /> I can create a file system using the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/\">AWS Management Console</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\">AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)</a>, API, or <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/\">AWS CloudFormation</a>. On the console, I choose <strong>Create file system</strong> to get started.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/25/screen1_1.png\"><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/25/screen1_1-1024x162.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"162\" /></a><br /> I select <strong>Amazon FSx for Lustre</strong> and choose <strong>Next</strong>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/08/screen2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/08/screen2-1024x468.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"468\" /></a><br /> Now, it’s time to enter the rest of the information to create the file system. I enter a name (<code>veliswa_fsxINT_1</code>) for my file system, and for deployment and storage class, I select <strong>Persistent, </strong><strong>Intelligent-Tiering</strong>. I choose the desired <strong>Throughput capacity </strong>and the <strong>Metadata IOPS. </strong>The <strong>SSD read cache</strong> will be automatically configured by FSx for Lustre based on the specified throughput capacity. I leave the rest as the default, choose <strong>Next</strong>, and review my choices to create my file system.</p> \n<p><em>With Amazon FSx for Lustre Intelligent-Tiering, you have the flexibility to provision the necessary performance for your workloads without having to provision any underlying storage capacity upfront.</em></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/28/screen4_444.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/28/screen4_444-1024x454.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"454\" /></a><br /> I wanted to know which values were editable after creation, so I paid closer attention before finalizing the creation of the file system. I noted that Throughput capacity, Metadata IOPS, Security groups, SSD read cache, and a few others were editable later. After I start running the ML jobs, it might be necessary to increase the throughput capacity based on the volumes of data I’ll be processing, so this information is important to me.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/28/screen5_55.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/28/screen5_55-1024x468.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"468\" /></a></p> \n<p>The file system is now available. Considering that I’ll be running HPC workloads, I anticipate that I’ll be processing high volumes of data later, so I’ll increase the throughput capacity to <strong>24 GB/s</strong>. After all, I only pay for the resources I use.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/25/screen5_5-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/25/screen5_5-1-1024x212.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"212\" /></a><br /> <em><br /> The SSD read cache is scaled automatically as your performance needs increase.
