Kelly sentenced Sun to 57\nmonths in prison, and sentenced Xue to 54 months in prison. [...]</p>\n\n<p>According to the government’s evidence, between May 2017 and\nSeptember 2019, Sun, Xue, and other conspirators defrauded Apple\nInc. by submitting counterfeit iPhones to Apple Inc. for repair to\nget Apple to exchange them with genuine replacement iPhones. Sun\nand Xue received shipments of inauthentic iPhones from Hong Kong\nat UPS mailboxes throughout the D.C. metropolitan area. They then\nsubmitted the fake iPhones, with spoofed serial numbers and/or\nIMEI numbers, to Apple retail stores and Apple Authorized Service\nProviders, including the Apple Store in Georgetown. Trial evidence\nand evidence developed after trial showed that members of the\nconspiracy submitted more than 6,000 inauthentic phones to Apple\nduring the conspiracy, causing an intended loss of approximately\n$3.8 million and an actual loss of more than $2.5 million.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems like a scam you might expect to get away with a few times. Maybe more than a few, if you keep taking the counterfeit iPhones to different stores. But 6,000?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/02/counterfeit-iphone-scam\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"58fa9e6eb218fa58072b376ae61f748864bebc2d0fd0753dbb3f90ad3154b456","category":"Tech"}
