Now, an all-new Trail Performance &amp; Sport pairing makes it a simple decision. Pick Boa fine-tuning and a secure velcro strap for a more performance-focused fit. Or stick with good old laces for a more sporty approach and classic looks that transition off the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Suplest-Trail-Performance-Boa-dial-mountain-bike-shoes_tech-details.jpg\"><img width=\"1750\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Suplest-Trail-Performance-Boa-dial-mountain-bike-shoes_tech-details.jpg\" alt=\"Suplest Trail Performance Boa-dial mountain bike shoes, tech details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Suplest-Trail-Performance-Boa-dial-mountain-bike-shoes_tech-details.jpg 1750w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Suplest-Trail-Performance-Boa-dial-mountain-bike-shoes_tech-details-297x153.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Suplest-Trail-Performance-Boa-dial-mountain-bike-shoes_tech-details-800x411.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Suplest-Trail-Performance-Boa-dial-mountain-bike-shoes_tech-details-120x62.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Suplest-Trail-Performance-Boa-dial-mountain-bike-shoes_tech-details-768x395.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Suplest-Trail-Performance-Boa-dial-mountain-bike-shoes_tech-details-1536x790.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Suplest Trail clipless mountain bike shoes are manufactured in Taiwan, something we see more for bikes and components than shoes or apparel.
