At the time, UniSuper indicated it had lost everything it had stored with Google, even its backups, and that caused two weeks of downtime for its 647,000 members. There were <a href=\"https://www.unisuper.com.au/about-us/media-centre/2024/a-joint-statement-from-unisuper-and-google-cloud\">joint statements</a> from the Google Cloud CEO and UniSuper CEO on the matter, a lot of apologies, and presumably a lot of worried customers who wondered if their retirement fund had disappeared.</p>\n<p>In the immediate aftermath, the explanation we got was that \"the disruption arose from an unprecedented sequence of events whereby an inadvertent misconfiguration during provisioning of UniSuper’s Private Cloud services ultimately resulted in the deletion of UniSuper’s Private Cloud subscription.\" Two weeks later, Google Cloud's internal review of the problem is finished, and the company has <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/details-of-google-cloud-gcve-incident\">a blog post up</a> detailing what happened.</p>\n<p>Google has a \"TL;DR\" at the top of the post, and it sounds like a Google employee got an input wrong.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027704#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027704&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5afeb4bad084e8bccfa8090a970bf71b607ab6d76787551737c0e9506634026b","category":"Tech"}
