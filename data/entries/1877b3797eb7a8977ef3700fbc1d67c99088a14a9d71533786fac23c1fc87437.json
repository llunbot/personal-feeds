The Tokyo District Court lawsuit seeks an injunction and damages \"on the grounds that <em>Palworld</em> infringes multiple patent rights\" according to the announcement.</p>\n<p>\"Nintendo will continue to take necessary actions against any infringement of its intellectual property rights including the Nintendo brand itself, to protect the intellectual properties it has worked hard to establish over the years,\" the company writes.</p>\n<p>The many surface similarities between <em>Pokémon</em> and <em>Palworld</em> are readily apparent, even though Pocketpair's game adds many new features over Nintendo's (such as, uh, guns).

That's because copyright law (at least in the US) <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/06/defining-tetris-how-courts-judge-gaming-clones\">generally doesn't apply to a game's mere design elements</a>, and only extends to \"expressive elements\" such as art, character design, and music.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050891#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050891&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1877b3797eb7a8977ef3700fbc1d67c99088a14a9d71533786fac23c1fc87437","category":"Tech"}
