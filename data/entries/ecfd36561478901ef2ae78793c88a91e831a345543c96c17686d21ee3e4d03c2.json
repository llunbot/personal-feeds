{"title":"Twitter Alternative Post News Is Shutting Down","link":"https://post.news/@/noam/2fJw4PYRFjya343RpiToiyEQr0x","date":1713562223000,"content":"\n<p>Noam Bardin:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is with a heavy heart that I share this sad news with you. \nDespite how much we’ve accomplished together, we will be shutting \ndown Post News within the next few weeks. </p>\n\n<p>We have done many great things together. We built a toxicity-free \ncommunity, a platform where Publishers engage, and an app that \nvalidated many theories around Micropayments and consumers’ \nwillingness to purchase individual articles. We even managed to \ncultivate a phenomenal tipping ecosystem for creators and \ncommenters. </p>\n\n<p>But, at the end of the day, our service is not growing fast enough \nto become a real business or a significant platform. A consumer \nbusiness, at its core, needs to show rapid consumer adoption and \nwe have not managed to find the right product combination to make \nit happen. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Post News was a longshot from the start, going up against (a) the entrenched leader in the space, Twitter/X; (b) the open alternative of Mastodon; (c) Meta-backed and Instagram-derived Threads; and (d) the Jack-Dorsey-funded Bluesky. I’m not sure there’s room for all four of those, let alone a fifth.</p>\n\n<p>But I think Post shot itself in the foot right out of the gate going web-only. They eventually got around to putting an “app” in the App Store but it’s just a thin wrapper around their website — so thin that you can drag-and-drop the tab controller buttons and <a href=\"https://capacitorjs.com/\">see exactly which PWA framework</a> they used <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/04/post-news-capacitor.jpeg\">from the custom URLs shown in the drag proxy</a>. People don’t want to use PWAs; they want real apps. Native iOS apps are so important to social networking that Threads launched app-only for its first two months before launching its web version.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/19/post-post-news\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ecfd36561478901ef2ae78793c88a91e831a345543c96c17686d21ee3e4d03c2","category":"Tech"}
