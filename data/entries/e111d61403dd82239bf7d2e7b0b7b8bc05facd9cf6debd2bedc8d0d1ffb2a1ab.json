The firmware features a build number of 2A61, up from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/12/apple-releases-airtags-firmware-update-2a36/\">the 2A36 firmware</a> that came out last December.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/AitTag-New-Firmware.jpg\" width=\"2390\" height=\"1344\" />\r<br />\nIt has been nearly a year since Apple updated the firmware on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a>, and there is no word yet on what might be included in the update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nToday's firmware release will be rolling out on a staggered basis. One percent of users will get the update today, and then it will expand to 10 percent of users on November 7. On November 14, an additional 25 percent of users will see the update, and then it will be available to all on November 28.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is not possible to force an AirTag update, as it's something that's done over-the-air through a connected <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>.
