Companies agonize over the physical shapes of their devices and the materials used, all trying to create a high-quality, premium-feeling device that fits with the constraints of mass production. Material choices usually center around cost, feeling, and durability, but how often do manufacturers take into account <em>smell? </em>Samsung users are finding that if you pop out the Galaxy S24 Ultra's \"S-Pen\" stylus and give it a whiff like you're huffing a marker, you'll find that it... smells bad?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2024/03/22/samsung-ultra-s-pen-stink-galaxy-note/\">9to5Google</a> found the following incredible post from Reddit user \"LatifYil\" titled, \"<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1bixq94/why_does_my_s_pen_smell_so_bad/\">Why does my s pen smell so bad?</a>\" The post has almost 250 comments of users all mostly agreeing with the post's sentiment that \"the S-Pen in my Galaxy S24 Ultra absolutely reeks. Either I have a sensitive nose or this thing is being barbequed by the internals while it's unsheathed.\" The top-rated, very-online comment is, \"Op got me to smell my pen. Can confirm it's a stinky boi.\"</p>\n<p>Those describing the smell all seem to agree Samsung's stylus often smells like an electrical fire. One user <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1bixq94/why_does_my_s_pen_smell_so_bad/kvnme2s/\">writes</a> that it's \"a very burnt and plastics smell.\" Another says the S23 Ultra stylus \"smells like new tech with a hint of burning.\" A <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1bixq94/why_does_my_s_pen_smell_so_bad/kvobuky/\">more descriptive</a> commenter says it smells like \"an electric mixer that's turned on, but the beaters are jammed up and can't turn, so the motor is overheating.\" The S-Pen is mostly plastic but has a soft rubber tip, and a lot of users identify that soft bit as the smelly part.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012171#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012171&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b861b2d29b5e337e50fc5814ec6ede7e9acc5f019a00fcfbfdcd89919b6e01b1","category":"Tech"}
