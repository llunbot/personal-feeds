The company said it continued to “investigate the circumstances surrounding the malware's intrusion and whether information has been leaked.” There was no indication how many records were exposed or how many people may be affected.</p>\n<p>Fujitsu employs 124,000 people worldwide and reported about $25 billion in its fiscal 2023, which ended at the end of last March. The company operates in 100 countries. Past customers include the Japanese government. Fujitsu’s revenue comes from sales of hardware such as computers, servers, and telecommunications gear, storage systems, software, and IT services.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010974#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010974&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3c2cfe826b2c53c520dfd524d4176b57da3af4a5adc7020015a3fe6a2c581874","category":"Tech"}
