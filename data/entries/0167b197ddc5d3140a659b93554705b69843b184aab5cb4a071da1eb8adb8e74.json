There is little doubt now that she is the best rider in the world - she has spent her season in the rainbow jersey winning major classics like <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/strade-bianche-everything-you-need-to-know\">Strade Bianche</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/paris-roubaix-everything-you-need-to-know\">Paris-Roubaix</a>, competing in stage races to triumph at the Women's Tour of Britain and Tour de Romandie, and she even won a time trial gold at the European Championships. But although these results do indicate that she is now so much more than a sprinting Classics specialist, there is an awful lot of climbing to contend with in this course in Zurich, and she’ll also have to rely on her Belgian teammates to control attacks from the more natural climbers. </span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/ZW-101139_1024x1024.jpg?v=1727362624\" /></div>\n<h3><span>DEMI VOLLERING</span></h3>\n<p>Since being beaten into second place by trade teammate and international rival Lotte Kopecky at last year’s World Championship road race, runner-up finishes have become frustratingly familiar to Demi Vollering. A silver medal at last weekend’s elite time trial follows similar recent near misses at both the Tour de France Femmes and Tour de Romandie, as well as four podium finishes during the spring Classics. She’s in need of a big win, and the hilly parcours in Zurich, as well as a typically strong Dutch line-up to support her, might be exactly what she needs to earn what would be a first ever rainbow jersey. </p>\n<h3><span>ELISA LONGO BORGHINI</span></h3>\n<p>As has often been the case in recent years, the Italians look the best equipped to take on the Dutch supremacy. However, despite frequently bringing strong line-ups, they’ve only won the gold once since 2011 courtesy of Elisa Balsamo. For a course more suited to climbers than sprinters, the Italians have backed Borghini over Balsamo to lead this year’s challenge, and she’s well-positioned to do so in a season that has already brought her a maiden Giro title as well as the Tour of Flanders victory. Whether or not she can also at last add Worlds gold to her palmares might depend on her fitness, but a runner-up finish at the recent GP de Wallonie suggests she’s coming into form just in time. </p>\n<h3><span>KASIA NIEWIADOMA</span></h3>\n<p><span>From eternal bridesmaid to champion of the biggest stage race in the sport, Kasia Niewiadoma’s career will never be the same after her Tour de France Femmes triumph last month. Any issue with confidence she might have due her seemingly unbreakable habit of failing to convert strong legs into wins must surely now have dissipated, and the result might just open the floodgates for more success — starting with Saturday's Worlds road race. She hasn’t raced at all since the Tour though, so her form is uncertain and a victory like that is undoubtedly emotionally as well as physically draining.</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/ZW-109219_1024x1024.jpg?v=1727363079\" /></div>\n<h3><span>GRACE BROWN</span></h3>\n<p><span>Might there be one last twist in this fairytale final season for Grace Brown? The Australian last weekend added the Worlds time trial title to the one she won at the Olympics, and will now represent her nation one last time for the road race. Though she’s said she will have a more shared leadership role in the Australian squad, she’s not a rider anyone can afford to slip clear like she did during the spring to win Liège–Bastogne–Liège. </span></p>\n<h3><span>KRISTEN FAULKNER</span></h3>\n<p><span>The pedigree of Kristen Faulkner has rocketed since her<a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/gold-in-the-city-of-light-for-kristen-faulkner\"> surprise victory at the Olympics road race in Paris</a>, so much so that she must now be counted among the favourites for the Worlds road race too. On one hand, a repeat of the late attack that saw her slip clear for victory that day is more unlikely, now she’ll be more heavily marked; but the fact she had the legs to both stay with the favourites and attack them shows how strong she is, and this course in Zurich likely suits her even better than the one in Paris. </span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/ZW-209507_1024x1024.jpg?v=1727364115\" /></div>\n<h3><span>OTHER CONTENDERS</span></h3>\n<p><span>While Demi Vollering will lead the Dutch contingent, their line-up contains multiple other potential winners. Expect </span><span>Marianne Vos </span><span>to ride a quiet, savvy race, staying in contention to be ready to strike in the event that Vollering is neutralised, while </span><span>Puck Pieterse</span><span> provides a wildcard option that could be difficult for other teams to control. The French also have multiple options: </span><span>Juliette Labous </span><span>and </span><span>Évita Muzic </span><span>both likely to enjoy the hilly parcours, plus their line-up includes Tour de France stage winner </span><span>Cédrine Kerbaol </span><span>and a rare </span><span>Pauline Ferrand-Prévot </span><span>appearance on the road.</span></p>\n<p><span>The home fans will be relying on </span><span>Elise Chabbey</span><span> to put on a show, and don’t put it past the indefatigable Swisswoman to attempt a similar move to her long-range attack from Glasgow last year. Hungarian </span><span>Blanka Vas </span><span>has a habit of riding to the occasion on the biggest races, and will be hoping for the legs that saw her place fourth at the Olympics in Paris; </span><span>Liane Lippert</span><span>’s fast finish makes her a threat in the event of a small group sprint; and veterans </span><span>Mavi García </span><span>and</span><span> Ashleigh Moolman-Pasio </span><span>are hoping favourable parcours can help them earn what would for both be a first ever World title.</span></p>\n<h3><span>PREDICTION</span></h3>\n<p><span>Strength in numbers always gives the Dutch an advantage at the Worlds, reflected in the fact that they’ve won five of the last seven editions. That, as well as the suitable parcours, is why we’re backing </span><span>Demi Vollering</span><span> to go one better than last year and take the gold medal.</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"0167b197ddc5d3140a659b93554705b69843b184aab5cb4a071da1eb8adb8e74","category":"Cycling"}
