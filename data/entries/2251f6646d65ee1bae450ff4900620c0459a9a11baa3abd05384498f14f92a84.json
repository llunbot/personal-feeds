Announced today, the <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/mx-keys-mini.920-010475.html\" target=\"_blank\">Logitech MX Keys Mini</a> and <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/mx-keys-mini-for-mac.920-010389.html\" target=\"_blank\">MX Keys Mini for Mac</a> drop the numpad and navigational keys of the full-sized <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/mx-keys-wireless-keyboard.920-009295.html\" target=\"_blank\">Logitech MX Keys</a> released two years ago in favor of a smaller form factor that still packs some nifty features.</p>\n<p>Like the MX Keys, the smaller MX Keys Mini targets creative professionals with the ability to connect to three devices via Bluetooth Low Energy, allowing you to control up to three PCs, tablets, or smartphones without having to switch dongles or pair the keyboard over and over again (who has the time?). Logitech’s compact keyboard is compatible with Windows, macOS, iOS, iPadOS, Chrome, Android, and Linux.</p>\n<p>Differing from its predecessor, the MX Keys Mini includes an Emoji key for easy access to an Emoji keyboard. There’s also a dedicated key for turning your microphone on or off and a dictation key for talk-to-text.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798992#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798992&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2251f6646d65ee1bae450ff4900620c0459a9a11baa3abd05384498f14f92a84","category":"Tech"}
