LG's C series TVs have been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-oled-tv/\" target=\"_blank\">widely praised</a> for delivering inky blacks, excellent contrast, wide viewing angles, smooth motion, and gaming-friendly features.</p>\n<p>Compared to the C1, the 2022 C2 improves peak brightness (specifically in the 55-inch size, not the 42- and 48-inch models) and supports 48Gbps of bandwidth (up from 40Gbps) to the four HDMI 2.1 ports. The C2 also natively supports Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, as well as a variable refresh rate for smoother gameplay. The 48-inch C2 is currently just $20 shy of the lowest price we've ever tracked, about $650 off MSRP and at least $100 off the typical street price.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3DYWdx7\" target=\"_blank\">LG C2</a> (2022) 48-inch 4K OLED TV for <strong>$844</strong> ($1,499) at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3DYWdx7\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?subId1=dealmaster110522&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLG-48-Class-4K-UHD-OLED-Web-OS-Smart-TV-with-Dolby-Vision-C2-Series-OLED48C2PUA%2F114002149%3Fathbdg%3DL1100&amp;partnerpropertyid=1161679\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a> (price in cart)</li>\n</ul>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/LG-OLED65C2PUA-1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/LG-OLED65C2PUA-1-640x360.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/LG-OLED65C2PUA-1.jpg 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/LG-OLED65C2PUA-1.jpg\"></a> </p></div>\n<p>Samsung's 980 Pro internal SSDs have been a crowd favorite for building high-performance gaming PCs or upgrading the storage on a PS5. Samsung rates its write speeds at up to 7,000MB, and it comes with or without a heatsink. It has been on sale for the past few weeks at lower prices than usual. So, although it's not currently at the lowest price we've tracked, it can still be a nice pick up. If you do nab one, make sure to <a href=\"https://semiconductor.samsung.com/consumer-storage/support/tools/\">update the device's firmware</a> to the latest version. Samsung's 980 and 990 SSDs have recently been suffering <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/02/pc-maker-pulls-samsung-pro-ssds-after-users-report-abnormal-health-drops/\">some reliability and data loss issues</a>, but Samsung says it has addressed the problems via updated firmware.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934999#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934999&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Corey Gaskin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5d3f81b295eaeab6eac3502f97a9c7765ba99678a334c41325e3d9e11308509c","category":"Tech"}
