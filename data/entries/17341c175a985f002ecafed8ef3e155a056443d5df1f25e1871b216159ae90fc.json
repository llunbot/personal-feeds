{"title":"John Sterling, Radio Voice of the Yankees for 36 Years, Retires at 85","link":"https://www.mlb.com/yankees/news/john-sterling-retires","date":1713230789000,"content":"\n<p>Bryan Hoch, MLB.com:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Yankees announced on Monday that Sterling has retired, \neffective immediately. The 85-year-old Sterling will be \nrecognized in a pregame ceremony on Saturday at Yankee Stadium. \nHe will visit the WFAN radio booth during that afternoon’s game \nagainst the Rays. </p>\n\n<p>“I am a very blessed human being,” Sterling said in a statement. \n“I have been able to do what I wanted, broadcasting for 64 years. \nAs a little boy growing up in New York as a Yankees fan, I was \nable to broadcast the Yankees for 36 years. It’s all to my \nbenefit, and I leave very, very happy. I look forward to seeing \neveryone again on Saturday.” [...] </p>\n\n<p>Known for his gyrating “Sterling Shake” victory call (“Yankees win \n… theeeeee Yankees win!”), humorous phrases tacked onto \nplay-by-play action (“Back to back, and a belly to belly!”) and \npersonalized home run calls (“Bern Baby Bern!”), Sterling called \n5,060 consecutive games from September 1989 to July 2019 — every \nat-bat of Derek Jeter’s career, every inning of Mariano Rivera’s \nand more. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The story includes a slew of his all-time great calls; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/trending/1779962020491850019\">more here on Twitter/X</a>. There’s something different about radio announcing from TV announcing. Some guys can do both. But there was something ineffably <em>radio</em> about Sterling. I will always think of stadium announcer <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/10/how-bob-sheppards-voice-lives-on.html\">Bob Shephard</a> as “the voice of the Yankees”, but John Sterling was the voice of Yankee <em>fans</em>. He just unabashedly loved the team, and was ecstatic for every win, and crushed with every loss.</p>\n\n<p>And think about this: He called over 5,400 Yankee games over 36 years. He’s legitimately considered a living legend for it. But he didn’t get the job until he was 49 years old.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/15/sterling-retires\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"17341c175a985f002ecafed8ef3e155a056443d5df1f25e1871b216159ae90fc","category":"Tech"}
