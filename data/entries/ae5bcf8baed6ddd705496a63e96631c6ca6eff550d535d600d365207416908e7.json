This is because light loss occurs as it passes through the display area before it reaches the camera lens, which can result in a deterioration in image quality and brightness.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo compensate for this, LG Innotek is developing a special \"freeform optic\" multiple lens system that can reduce optical aberrations and increase the light intensity ratio around the optical module to improve peripheral image quality. LG Innotek has been publishing patents for the technology since December last year, and more are expected now that development has begun.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLG Display, an affiliate of LG Innotek's LG Group, has also started UPC development, according to the report. LG Display aims to increase the UDC's light transmittance to 20% by 2023 and 40% after 2024, bringing it closer to the standard that Apple expects. Apple reportedly already received a UDC sample from an unnamed vendor, but rated it as unsatisfactory in performance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBefore Apple uses the perfected under-screen camera technology, it is expected to adopt <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/\">under-panel Face ID technology in 2025's iPhone 17 Pro</a>. This is expected to be Apple's last premium model to include a circular cutout for the front-facing camera. Apple will then adopt the UDC in 2027's \"Pro\" ‌iPhone‌ models, according to respected analyst Ross Young of research firm Display Supply Chain Consultants.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theelec-kr/\">The Elec</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/iphone-under-display-camera/\">'All-Screen' iPhone Under-Display Camera Enters Development</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-screen-iphone-under-display-camera-enters-development.2412943/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ae5bcf8baed6ddd705496a63e96631c6ca6eff550d535d600d365207416908e7","category":"Apple"}
