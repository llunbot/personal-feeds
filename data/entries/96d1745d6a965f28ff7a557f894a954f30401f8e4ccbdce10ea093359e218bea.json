The company set expectations pretty high with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/razers-n95-voice-boost-active-ventilators-led-lights-in-mask-prototype/\" target=\"_blank\">the mask's initial prototype reveal in January</a>, only to cut down features to make the mask cheaper and lighter. Yet this launch version is still a far cry from the cloth masks that are so ubiquitous these days.</p>\n<p>And since it's from Razer, a peripheral manufacturer best known for neon-tinged gaming mice, headphones, and keyboards, the mask looks striking. Look at it! The Razer Zephyr is basically a gaming mouse that you strap to your face, RGB lighting and all. So I <em>had</em> to try it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810518#p3\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810518&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"96d1745d6a965f28ff7a557f894a954f30401f8e4ccbdce10ea093359e218bea","category":"Tech"}
