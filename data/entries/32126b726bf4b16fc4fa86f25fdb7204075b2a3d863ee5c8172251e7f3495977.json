You can fit 180mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/disc-brake-rotors/\">disc brake rotors</a>.</p>\n<p>The test bike was fitted out with 2.4in WTB Ranger tyres on Hunt Trailwide 29 wheels, which have a 30mm internal rim width.

There’s even an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-gravel-bikes/\">electric gravel bike</a> in the range.</p>\n<p>The bike’s versatility is its strong point, enabling you to kit it out for road riding as well as hitting gravel, so it doesn’t close down your options. You can fit either <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/650b-vs-700c-for-gravel/\">650b or 700c wheels</a>, with clearance of up to 47mm.</p>\n<p>The ride is comfortable and compliant, so it’s easy to clock up the miles, although we’d have preferred to see hydraulic disc brakes. It’s as easy to upgrade to a higher rung of Shimano groupset though, as it is to change the wheels, tyres and other components via the Ribble Bike Builder.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/ribble-cgr-725-steel-review/\">Read our full Ribble CGR 725 Steel review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Surly Grappler</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Surly Grappler gravel bike\" title=\"Surly Grappler - 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Surly Grappler’s ride position feels perfect, even if it’s more mountain than road bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£2,350/$1,950 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Stable and smooth on tricky terrain</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Braking could be better; drivetrain arguably not up to Shimano or SRAM standard</li>\n</ul><p>While many gravel bikes, particularly those designed for racing, are increasingly long and low, the Surly Grappler takes things the other way with a very high front end.

They tend to be easy to service too, with threaded bottom brackets, and often with external cabling and lower-priced, more robust components. Durability tends to be good. Look after your steel frame and it should last you for many years.</p>\n<p>If you’re heading to far-flung places on your gravel bike, one advantage of steel is you can find someone who knows how to repair it almost everywhere. If it’s run over by a truck in the Andes (it has happened), a local welder should be able to beat and weld it back together again.</p>\n<p>You’re going to be out of luck if the same thing happens to your carbon, titanium or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aluminium-gravel-bikes/\">aluminium gravel bike</a>.</p>\n<h3>Are steel gravel bikes heavy?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rå Valravn steel gravel bike with SRAM XPLR groupset, RockShox Rudy Ultimate XPLR fork and RockShox Reverb AXS XPLR dropper post\" title=\"Rå Valravn steel gravel bike with SRAM XPLR groupset, RockShox Rudy Ultimate XPLR fork and RockShox Reverb AXS XPLR dropper post\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Steel gravel bikes do tend to weigh more than other gravel bikes – but this isn’t always a disadvantage.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Steel gravel bikes tend to be heavier than gravel bikes made of other materials. That’s not necessarily an issue though, particularly if you plan to take on a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/bikepacking/\">bikepacking</a> expedition, where the weight of your luggage is likely to be more significant than any increase in bike or frame weight.</p>\n<p>If your style of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/what-is-gravel-riding/\">gravel riding</a> tends to be bombing about in the woods, steel’s robustness may also be more significant than any extra weight.</p>\n<h3>Steel gravel bikes vs carbon gravel bikes</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"English Cycles' steel gravel bike with the Limited groupset.\" title=\"English Cycles' steel gravel bike with the Limited groupset.\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> In contrast to carbon fibre, steel gravel bikes are a lot cheaper to produce, leading to bespoke bikes such as this one from English Cycles.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Shimano </i></span></div>\n<p>In general, a carbon gravel bike will be lighter than a steel gravel bike. The properties of carbon fibre mean it’s easier to construct a frame that’s compliant in one direction but stiff in another, because the fibre can be laid up to achieve this.</p>\n<p>In contrast, frames made of steel must rely on tube shapes to achieve the same compliance features, because the metal has the same properties in all directions. The flex inherent in steel means it does a good job of soaking up vibrations from the surface you’re riding over though.</p>\n<p>Making a carbon gravel bike is big business. The moulds needed to form the frame are expensive, so a brand needs a large volume of production to recoup the initial setup cost. Bikes are usually made in Taiwan by sub-contractors. There’s little room for customisation, so carbon gravel bikes normally come in pre-set sizes.</p>\n<p>In contrast, it’s a lot cheaper to set up to produce a steel gravel bike. That means steel is favoured by small producers, which in turn means there’s more room for innovation. That’s why many of the best steel gravel bikes feature unusual specs and geometries. It also makes a bespoke frame an option.</p>\n<p>A steel gravel bike may be heavier, but it may also be more individualistic.</p>\n<p>While the steel gravel bikes in this list take inspiration from the world of mountain bikes, many of the best gravel race bikes are made from carbon fibre and these tend to take greater inspiration from road bikes.</p>\n<h3>Steel gravel bikes vs titanium gravel bikes</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Moots Routt 45 Ti gravel bike\" title=\"Moots Routt 45\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Titanium gravel bikes, such as this Moots Routt, can be much more expensive than steel gravel bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-titanium-gravel-bikes/\">best titanium gravel bikes</a> will usually be considerably lighter than an equivalently specced steel gravel bike, because titanium tubing is stronger weight-for-weight. Titanium tubing for gravel bikes is also likely to have been drawn less, so its walls will be thicker, which in turn means it may be better able to withstand dings and bumps from rocks.</p>\n<p>Most steel tubing used for bikes can rust, although some bikes can be made of stainless steel and many frames are treated to prevent rusting. That’s not a problem with titanium, which doesn’t corrode, which is why many titanium framesets go unpainted.</p>\n<p>Titanium is very much more expensive than steel though and it’s more difficult to build up into a frameset, so you’ll pay a lot more for a titanium gravel bike. That’s accentuated by the tendency to attach more expensive parts to titanium frames, to match the higher price tag for the frame.</p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"32126b726bf4b16fc4fa86f25fdb7204075b2a3d863ee5c8172251e7f3495977","category":"Cycling"}
