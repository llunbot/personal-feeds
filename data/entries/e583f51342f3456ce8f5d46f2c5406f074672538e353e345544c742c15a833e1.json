An increase to 35W would speed up charging times.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple does not sell a power adapter with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> anymore, but the company recommends a 20W+ charger for fast charging purposes right now. If the ‌iPhone 15‌ models support up to 35W charging, Apple could start recommending its 30W <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> charger or its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/17/apple-35w-chargers-available-to-order/\">35W Dual USB-C charger</a> for maximum charging speed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this year, Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that the ‌iPhone 15‌ models would support faster charging speeds due to the transition to USB-C. He said that the faster speeds would be available with MFi-certified USB-C chargers, including the 20W power adapter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere have been rumors that Apple will limit faster charging speeds to MFi-certified cables and chargers, and it is also possible that the fastest charging speeds could be reserved for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/17/iphone-15-faster-charging-speeds/\">iPhone 15 Might Support Charging Speeds Up to 35W</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-might-support-charging-speeds-up-to-35w.2398935/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e583f51342f3456ce8f5d46f2c5406f074672538e353e345544c742c15a833e1","category":"Apple"}
