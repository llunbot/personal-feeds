This rare discount is the best price we’ve ever seen and the perfect time to add a smart speaker to your home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The HomePod Mini is jam-packed with cool features and manages to fill the room with rich, 360-degree audio. Whether you’re hosting a party or enjoying some quiet time, its powerful sound ensures an immersive listening experience. When we <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234895/homepod-mini-review.html\">reviewed the HomePod Mini</a>, we appreciated how loud the speaker can get but weren’t thrilled with the quality of the bass. We also noted that “it’s quite loud for its size and shouldn’t struggle to fill up any but the largest of rooms,” our review notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since you can easily place multiple HomePod Minis around your house to create a connected sound system, you can stay connected everywhere while also playing seamless audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part about the HomePod Mini, however, and probably the main reason you’re even considering getting one of these, is the easy access to Siri. “It listens extremely well and usually perked up when I whispered from across the room, which is good because the device doesn’t provide any visual cues that it heard you aside from the top screen, which you probably won’t be able to see,” our very own Executive Editor, Michael Simon, noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Siri will give you access to the same intelligent assistant options you have when using it from your phone, such as the ability to set reminders, control other smart home devices, look up information, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So hurry up and don’t let the <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-homepod-mini-white/6377590.p?skuId=6377590\" target=\"_blank\">HomePod Mini slip through your hands when it’s only $80 over at Best Buy</a>.</p>\n\n\n<span>The Apple HomePod Mini is $80 for now</span><div><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-homepod-mini-white/6377590.p?skuId=6377590\" target=\"_blank\">Get it at Best Buy</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"8bda7ce0e40a60f783775dbdd8b10f6d6f8a0b0f969dccd79b18695ccb0051e0","category":"Apple"}
