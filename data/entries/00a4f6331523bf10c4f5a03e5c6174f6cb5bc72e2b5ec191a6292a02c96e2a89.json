But there's one other Arc graphics card of note: the lowly Arc A380, which snuck into some stores a few months before either high-end Arc card was released.</p>\n<p>With its eight Xe cores (down from 32 in the A770), 96-bit memory interface, and 6GB of RAM, the Arc A380 has been (in my case, literally) nothing to write home about. It's an entry-level graphics card that competes reasonably well with ancient and low-end cards like Nvidia's GeForce RTX 1650 and AMD's Radeon RX 6400, and its hardware-accelerated AV1 video encoding support makes it mildly interesting for people who work with video. It's one of the better GPUs you can get for $100, <a href=\"https://www.newegg.com/asrock-arc-a380-a380-cli-6g/p/N82E16814930076\">its current street price</a>, but that's not saying much.</p>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/A380-old.png\" alt /></div>\n          <p>\n            Pre-firmware update, HWInfo reports the clock speed at 2,000 MHz.                           [credit:\n                              Andrew Cunningham                            ]\n                      </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n<p>But Intel's latest graphics drivers provided an update specifically for the A380 that seems notable because of how rare it is: the 31.0.101.4644 driver package <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/intel-brags-about-directx-performance-improvements-in-latest-arc-gpu-drivers/\">released last week</a> also includes a firmware update for A380 cards that seems to boost their base clock speed from 2,000 MHz up to 2,150 MHz. That's a 7.5 percent increase, supposedly being provided for free to all A380 owners with a simple firmware update. At least, it would be if it were an actual increase in the card's peak clock speed, which it isn't.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962022#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962022&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"00a4f6331523bf10c4f5a03e5c6174f6cb5bc72e2b5ec191a6292a02c96e2a89","category":"Tech"}
