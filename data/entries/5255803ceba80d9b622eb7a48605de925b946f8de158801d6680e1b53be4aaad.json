Following the move, Windows made it difficult, if not impossible, for normal actions to open the browser, which was first introduced in the mid-1990s.</p>\n<h2>Tricks old and new</h2>\n<p>Malicious code that exploits the vulnerability dates back to at least January 2023 and was circulating as recently as May this year, according to the researchers who discovered the vulnerability and reported it to Microsoft. The company <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2024-38112\">fixed</a> the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-CVE-38112, on Tuesday as part of its monthly patch release program. The vulnerability, which resided in the MSHTML engine of Windows, carried a severity rating of 7.0 out of 10.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036304#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036304&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5255803ceba80d9b622eb7a48605de925b946f8de158801d6680e1b53be4aaad","category":"Tech"}
