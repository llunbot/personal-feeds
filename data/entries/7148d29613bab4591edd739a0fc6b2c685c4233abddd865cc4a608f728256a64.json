The Apple Vision Pro is an exception to this simple process; the \"mixed-reality curious\" need to <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/retail/instore-shopping-session/session-selection/?topic=visionpro\">book ahead</a> for a guided, half-hour Vision Pro experience led by an Apple Store employee.</p>\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/virtual-realitys-time-to-shine-hands-on-with-the-oculus-rift/\">long-time veteran</a> of both <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/03/one-year-later-sonys-morpheus-prototype-is-still-vr-done-right/\">trade show</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/meta-quest-pro-hands-on-an-unimpressive-first-impression/\">retail</a> virtual-reality <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/hands-on-oculus-quest-is-an-intriguing-new-middle-ground-for-vr/\">demos</a>, I was interested to see how Apple would sell the concept of \"spatial computing\" to members of the public, many of whom have minimal experience with existing VR systems. And as someone who's been <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/five-ways-vision-pro-is-different-from-anything-apple-or-anyone-has-ever-made/\">following news</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/hands-on-with-apple-vision-pro-this-is-not-a-vr-headset/2/\">hands-on reports</a> of the Vision Pro's unique features for months now, I was eager to get a brief glimpse into what all the fuss was about without plunking down at least $3,499 for a unit of my own.</p>\n<p>After going through the guided Vision Pro demo at a nearby Apple Store this week, I came away with mixed feelings about how Apple is positioning its new computer interface to the public. While the short demo contained some definite \"oh, wow\" moments, the device didn't come with a cohesive story pitching it as Apple's next big general-use computing platform.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001718#p3\">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001718&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7148d29613bab4591edd739a0fc6b2c685c4233abddd865cc4a608f728256a64","category":"Tech"}
