And now it comes in a much better-looking Midnight Black.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/insta360-go-3-black-3.jpg\"><img width=\"1820\" height=\"1149\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/insta360-go-3-black-3.jpg\" alt=\"insta360 go 3 action camera shown mounted on cyclists\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/insta360-go-3-black-3.jpg 1820w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/insta360-go-3-black-3-297x188.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/insta360-go-3-black-3-800x505.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/insta360-go-3-black-3-120x76.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/insta360-go-3-black-3-768x485.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/insta360-go-3-black-3-1536x970.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It sports the same features as the original Arctic White model including a charging case with full-color screen that doubles as a remote control. The latter is a big improvement over <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/insta360-go-2-creates-worlds-smallest-stabilized-waterproof-action-camera/\">the GO 2</a>, which lacked a preview screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/insta360-go-3-black-1.jpg\"><img width=\"1320\" height=\"654\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/insta360-go-3-black-1.jpg\" alt=\"insta360 go 3 action camera in black\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/insta360-go-3-black-1.jpg 1320w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/insta360-go-3-black-1-297x147.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/insta360-go-3-black-1-800x396.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/insta360-go-3-black-1-120x59.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/insta360-go-3-black-1-768x381.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The camera itself weighs just 35g and uses a magnetic back to pair with multiple mounts. Wear the necklace pendant under your jersey and it’ll sit on your chest for POV shots, or clip to a helmet or bar mount. The case has a 1/4″-20 thread to work with tripods and selfie sticks, too, for handheld filming.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve used it to film inside frames and get closeup suspension action footage, but it’s size means you’re really only limited by your creativity. The only downside? Just don’t drop it on the trail, the darker color will be a lot harder to find.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSRP for the kit with multiple mounts and the Action Pod is $399 (64GB) and $429 (128GB).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://store.insta360.com/product/go-3?insrc=INR0EK\" target=\"_blank\">Insta360.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/insta360-go-3-now-comes-in-black-still-remarkably-small/\">Insta360 GO 3 Now Comes in Black, Still Remarkably Small</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"6cd9f38e4d5e68a9917a63de59f27c9c21ed3713af4096cccfc0abf710b463cf","category":"Cycling"}
