In a message to subscribers, Netflix has announced that the 2nd and 3rd generation Apple TV devices (the earlier, non-4K models) won’t be able to access the Netflix app after July 31, 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That leaves four Apple TV models that support Netflix: the 4th-gen Apple TV HD and all three Apple TV 4K models. Apple stopped selling the Apple TV HD in October 2022, so if you need a new model, you’ll need to upgrade to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1373000/apple-tv-4k-3rd-generation-review.html\">Apple TV 4K (3rd generation)</a>, which starts at $129. The 2nd-gen Apple TV was discontinued in 2012 while the 3rd-gen model remained on shelves until 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To clarify: If you bought your Apple TV within the last 8 years you should be fine, and if you need a new one, the only model Apple sells now is the 3rd-gen Apple TV 4K which starts at a reasonable $129.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Netflix says it is ending support to “maintain the best possible Netflix experience,” so it’s not clear whether the app will stop working entirely on August 1 or if some features will be unavailable. The main difference between the 3rd-gen and 4th-gen Apple TV HD boxes is the chip (A5 vs A8), where the A8 is significantly faster and more capable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The A5 chip is a single-core 32-bit system-on-a-chip while the 64-bit A8 has a dual-core CPU and quad-core GPU. The 1st-gen Apple TV 4K has an even newer chip, the A10X, which has a 6-core CPU and 12-core GPU.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple was expected to release a new Apple TV 4K in the first half of this year, but <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2354529/wwdc-no-new-hardware-mac-ipads-apple-tv.html\">a new report claims</a> that a new model “isn’t imminent.”</p>\n\nApple TV</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"dd2eb296ca42e35bde5a774c5326b889c29af6d49703fa46fcd73aef06978230","category":"Apple"}
