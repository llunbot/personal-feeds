It costs £8,800/$9,900/€9,500.</p>\n<h2>Return of the Patriot</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Orange Patriot LE\" title=\"Orange Patriot LE\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Patriot has a mullet setup, with mixed wheel sizes, which Orange says is fast becoming a standard in its range.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orange</i></span></div>\n<p>The Patriot used to be one of Orange’s original long-travel bikes. It was <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/orange-patriot-making-a-comeback-for-2012/\">last revived in 2012</a>, long before electric bikes were so prevalent on the trails.</p>\n<p>Orange says the new Patriot takes inspiration from the original bike’s versatility and capability, with the new eMTB touted as a gravity bike with a built-in uplift.</p>\n<p>Unlike the previous Patriot and the Phase MX, the new bike uses Orange’s new Strange Link <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">suspension linkage</a>, first seen on the Orange Switch 7.</p>\n<p>The Strange Link provides 170mm of rear wheel travel and is CNCed from a block of aluminium.</p>\n<p>While Orange stayed loyal to single-pivot suspension for a long time, it says the Strange Link linkage is better for powerful e-bikes where grip is paramount and helps with a sure-footed, trail-hugging ride.</p>\n<p>Orange says the linkage allows them to build a more progressive shock curve, giving the bike a bottomless feeling through the suspension which is a drawback of the singl-pivot system.</p>\n<p>The linkage also means you can use high-volume air shocks or coil shocks, with the leverage ratio falling from 2.86 to 2.14 through compression.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tech/best-electric-mountain-bike-motor/\">electric motor</a>, which delivers 85nm of torque and is powered by a 750Wh Power Tube battery in the downtube.</p>\n<p>Orange has previously used Shimano motors.</p>\n<p>The eMTB features Bosch’s Purion 200 bar-mounted computer so you can select performance modes and view data such as speed, battery

448mm compared to the 439mm chainstays found on the Phase MX.</p>\n<p>Orange says the geometry has been devised to keep the rider front and centre on the bike for control while climbing and
