And if you need one more way to obsessively track results, Apple News has you covered, whether you live in the U.S. or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you head over to the Apple News app on your iPhone, you’ll see a <em>Follow the Election Live</em> button at the top of the <em>Today</em> tab. Tap it and you’ll receive “real-time updates” tonight as electoral votes begin to be tallied, presumably beginning at 6 p.m. ET when the first polls begin to close in Kentucky and Indiana.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results will show up as a Live Activity on your Lock Screen and in the Dynamic Island, which you can click to get further information all night (and morning) long. Apple doesn’t illustrate how the tracker will operate, but a red/blue electoral college bar with live results could be the most nerve-wracking Dynamic Island activity ever made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s likely that the race isn’t decided tonight, but it’s unclear when the Live Activity will end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple News has comprehensive election coverage from a variety of sources, as well as state-by-state information for both subscribers and non-subscribers. You can also filter news by issue and candidate on the dedicated Election 2024 page.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"cb38efa64dd558bedfb76e7dd1f1af2c5655e4c6de7cd64fcc0c6ef4d7f877ae","category":"Apple"}
