To achieve that, the status quo and general consensus needed to be questioned – that meant making a bike that increases confidence through stability, smoothness and getting the details right.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510468-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510468-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510468-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510468-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510468-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510468-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510468-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510468-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510468-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510468-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510468-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first part of that was doing away with the idea that nervous handling through steep head angles and short trails is what fast feels like – stable handling inspires confidence, that’s why it’s a key characteristic of slower ‘endurance’ bikes, yet it’s equally true that when you’re stable and confident, you ride faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next it’s compliance, a word often associated with compromise on fast bikes, something to make stiffness more bearable, but Lauf knew from the Seigla how important compliance was for a smooth ride, and that a smooth ride is a fast ride – even though it may feel slower. And it’s not just in the tyres – although they definitely help, with 32mm fitted as standard and 35mm accepted (and Lauf believes we haven’t yet reached the conclusion of the road cycling’s understanding of the optimum tyre widths). The Úthald’s frame actually provides the same level of travel you’d get from 20-23mm tyres, and that’s on top of what the fitted wide tyres provide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This wasn’t achieved through complicated suspension technology, though. Lauf calls its system Integrated Compliance Engineering, ICE (yes, ice like Iceland). ICE provides smooth ride quality where it’s required without extra tech. Up front it’s seen in the Smoothie Road handlebar, with impact-resistant glass fibres used in the central part of the bar to smooth out bumps in the road and keep all power pushing forward.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510414-2-647x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510414-2-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510414-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510414-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510414-2-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510414-2-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510414-2-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510414-2-1140x1709.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510414-2-scaled.jpg 1707w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>At the rear, the Úthald has a series of features like the Seigla that give the bike a pivot-free rear suspension. The back portion of the top tube is slim and, combined with the standard seat clamp, creates a virtual pivot, while the seatstays are vertically slim and are dropped, which bends the seat tube slightly, making the saddle move back and down with any force coming from the ground. The tilted seat tube gives a better downward path for the saddle and the long exposed seatpost provides a lever arm for that virtual pivot below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s comfort and confidence dealt with, so what about speed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Úthald has the shortest chainstays possible (405mm) for its drivetrain and tyre clearance, which Lauf says gives the rider the ‘maximal sense of involvement’ because the rear doesn’t need the same stability as the front and short chainstays are lighter, stiffer and increase agility.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023104_THRAINN_505941-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023104_THRAINN_505941-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023104_THRAINN_505941-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023104_THRAINN_505941-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023104_THRAINN_505941-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023104_THRAINN_505941-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023104_THRAINN_505941-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023104_THRAINN_505941-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023104_THRAINN_505941-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023104_THRAINN_505941-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023104_THRAINN_505941-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s wireless-shifting only to save on weight but Lauf hasn’t fully integrated the remaining cables because the aesthetic gain wasn’t worth the hassle it adds for mechanics, travelling and adjusting, and the brand found the aero benefits of full integration to be negligible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike is built with Impact Resistant Modulus (IRM) carbon fibers, which may not sound as fancy as high-modulus fibers used by some other brands but, as Lauf will tell you, high-modulus fibers are very fragile and not a wise compromise. Yes, you can easily shave some grams off a frame by using high-modulus fibers, but at the expense of robustness and compliance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s aero where it matters, such as at the front end through a slim and deep head tube and the front section of the down tube. The back part of the down tube is wider, adding airflow shelter for bottles and increasing bottom bracket stiffness. The fork balances strength and aerodynamics with a slightly deep profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510506-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510506-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510506-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510506-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510506-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510506-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510506-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510506-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510506-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510506-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/2023106_THRAINN_510506-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All of that considered, Lauf was still trying to make a truly light bike, and the brand claims a fully painted size medium frame is just 985g, a fully painted fork 265g and a 40cm wide Smoothie Road handlebar 270g. There aren’t many rival bikes in the category as light as that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Úthald’ means ‘endurance’ in Icelandic, so it’s primed to slot into the endurance (or all-road) category. At the same time, it also breaks down to the words ‘út’ and ‘hald’, which together directly translate to ‘go out’, a perfect fit for Lauf’s ‘Just Ride’ motto.<br />What are you waiting for?</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/lauf-true-grit-race-edition-adventure-bike-review\">Lauf True Grit Race Edition adventure bike review</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/lauf-uthald\">The new Lauf Úthald road bike is built different</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Deputy Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"228e21a7ffbf27262d6481e1f37853bff6af120ffbc84521e21c36f8cc1652b6","category":"Cycling"}
