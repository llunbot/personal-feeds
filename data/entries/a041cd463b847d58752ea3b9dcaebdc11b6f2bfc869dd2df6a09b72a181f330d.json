The company originally launched Surface Duo 2\nin October 2021, and promised to support the product with software\nupdates for three years. Microsoft was only able to deliver one\nmajor Android version update in that time, a pitiful number for a\n$1,500 device.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It wasn’t that Microsoft was only <em>able</em> to deliver one major Android version update in 3 years. They’re Microsoft, for chrissakes. It’s that they could only be <em>bothered</em> to deliver one major upgrade. Commitment is vastly underestimated in the hardware game.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/09/microsofts-final-surface-duo-software-update\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a041cd463b847d58752ea3b9dcaebdc11b6f2bfc869dd2df6a09b72a181f330d","category":"Tech"}
