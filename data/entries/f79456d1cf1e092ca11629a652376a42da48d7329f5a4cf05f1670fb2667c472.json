Until last week, the page said the in-car software platform was available in more than 600 vehicle models. Apple added many 2023 and 2024 vehicle models to the list as part of the update.  \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/CarPlay-Phone-Call.jpg\" alt width=\"1597\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThe updated figure comes after GM announced that it plans to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/31/general-motors-to-phase-out-apple-carplay/\">phase out CarPlay in future electric vehicles</a> in favor of its own in-car software platform, developed in partnership with Google. The decision led to backlash from some customers given the immense popularity of CarPlay, but GM doubled down on the plans in an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/6/23156741/ios-16-carplay-apple-wwdc-hvac-deeper-integration\">interview with <em>The Verge</em></a> last week, saying it is building a \"holistically integrated\" operating system with a \"much-improved navigation and charging experience for future EV owners.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt WWDC last year, Apple stated that 79% of U.S. buyers would only consider a vehicle that works with CarPlay, and said the platform is available in 98% of vehicles sold in the country. \"It's a must-have feature when shopping for a new vehicle,\" touted Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple plans to introduce the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/next-gen-apple-carplay-features/\">next generation of CarPlay</a> later this year, promising support for multiple displays across the dashboard, instrument cluster integration, built-in climate controls, an FM radio app, widgets, increased personalization, and more. Apple said the first vehicles with support for the new CarPlay experience will be announced later this year, with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/14/next-gen-carplay-automakers-list/\">over a dozen automakers committed</a> to offering it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn related news, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nicolas09f9/status/1649781907582865408\">code on Apple's servers</a> suggests that British automaker Lotus is planning to support Apple's digital car key feature in the Wallet app, which would allow future vehicles to be unlocked, locked, and started with an iPhone or Apple Watch.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/24/carplay-over-800-vehicle-models/\">Apple Says CarPlay Now Available in Over 800 Vehicle Models as GM Plans to Phase Out Support in EVs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-carplay-now-available-in-over-800-vehicle-models-as-gm-plans-to-phase-out-support-in-evs.2387643/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f79456d1cf1e092ca11629a652376a42da48d7329f5a4cf05f1670fb2667c472","category":"Apple"}
