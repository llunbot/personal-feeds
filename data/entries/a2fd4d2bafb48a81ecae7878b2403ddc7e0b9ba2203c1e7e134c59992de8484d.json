{"title":"Does Apple have any tricks up its sleeve this April?","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2653693/apple-releases-april-2025-hardware-ios-18-5-tv-plus-arcade-services.html","date":1743506100000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>We expect April and May to be pretty slow months for Apple releases. There is no new hardware expected in either month, according to the latest rumors, and the major updates to the iOS 18 and macOS 15 cycle seem to be more or less done—Apple is shifting focus to iOS 19, which will be introduced at WWDC in June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, while there may be relatively minor software releases and new content added to services like Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade, we don’t really expect any big releases until WWDC.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New hardware releases</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t expect any new hardware in the month of April (and probably not May either). The current rumors report that the next round of hardware releases won’t be until at least WWDC in June, and likely not until September. But we’ve been surprised before, including last month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once upon a time, we were expecting a spring event in April, but after Apple launched the iPhone 16e in February and the MacBook Air, iPad Air, and iPad in March without an event, it seems as though the first keynote of 2025 will be held on June 9 at WWDC. But there’s an outside chance Apple will hold an event to launch its heavily rumored <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePad home hub</a> before then. But it’s a longshot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple was expected to release <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2605277/ios-18-4-beta-begins-with-huge-apple-intelligence-expansion-but-no-new-siri.html\">iOS 18.4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS 15.4</a>, and the other x.4 releases in April, but managed to get them out on the last day of March.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As March came to a close, Apple has yet to launch the iOS 18.5/macOS 15.5 beta release, but Apple usually issues an x.5 release in April or May as the last significant release before introducing the next major version (iOS 19, macOS 16) at WWDC in June. We were expecting the next-gen Siri to arrive in this release, but <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2624966/apples-next-gen-siri-might-be-delayed-until-2027.html#:~:text=News-,Apple's%20next%2Dgen%20Siri%20might%20be%20delayed%20until%202027,for%20its%20planned%20WWDC%20launch.\">Apple has delayed it</a> until “the coming year.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Services</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple TV+</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the shows, series, and movies we expect to release on Apple TV+ in TK.
