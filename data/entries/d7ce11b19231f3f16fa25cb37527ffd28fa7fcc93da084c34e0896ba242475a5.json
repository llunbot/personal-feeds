The mouse pointer is visible, but nothing shows up on the display. Affected Macs include an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> 14-inch MacBook Pro, an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-max/\">M1 Max</a> MacBook Pro, but not all users are having installation troubles.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are multiple reports from people who have had no issues installing the beta, so it is not clear where the problem lies. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOSBeta/comments/159f1x9/sonoma_b4_available/\">On Reddit</a>, one user was able to fix the issue by going into recovery mode and reinstalling the beta, and another had luck with multiple reboots, but that does not seem to solve the problem for everyone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn the <em>MacRumors</em> forums, there are also reports of issues with widgets not showing up properly and the Music app not opening, which were fixed by restarting. Given the number of problems with the software, those who are using <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/\">macOS Sonoma</a> on a main machine might want to wait to upgrade to the fourth beta.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/\">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243\">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/macos-sonoma-beta-4-issues/\">PSA: macOS 14 Sonoma Beta 4 Not Installing Properly for Some Users</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/psa-macos-14-sonoma-beta-4-not-installing-properly-for-some-users.2396887/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d7ce11b19231f3f16fa25cb37527ffd28fa7fcc93da084c34e0896ba242475a5","category":"Apple"}
