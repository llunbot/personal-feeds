Samples are usually found in dry caves, desert areas, frozen areas, or waterlogged environments (like bogs), according to Maixner and his co-authors, where desiccation, freezing, and similar processes preserve the fecal matter for posterity.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1803534#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1803534&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f0bed31b8b959cf7064a9a66dbdfa991145bb5853e857bfb1a01ddc10337bd80","category":"Tech"}
