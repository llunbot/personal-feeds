As such, food makers are bracing for slimmer sales. In <a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/obesity-drugs-market-expanded-opportunity\">a report earlier this month</a>, Morgan Stanley's tobacco and packaged food analyst Pamela Kaufman said the drugs are expected to affect both the amounts and the types of food people eat, taking a bite out of the food and drink industry's profits.</p>\n<p>\"In Morgan Stanley Research surveys, people taking weight-loss drugs were found to eat less food in general, while half slashed their consumption of sugary drinks, alcohol, confections and salty snacks, and nearly a quarter stopped drinking alcohol completely,\" Kaufman said. Restaurants that sell unhealthy foods, particularly chains, may face long-term business risks, the report noted.
