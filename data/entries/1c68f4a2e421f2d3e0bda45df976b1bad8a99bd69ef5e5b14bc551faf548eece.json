If it returned a blank screen this morning—or yesterday morning or the morning before that—it’s not an issue with your Wi-Fi—Apple’s systems have been having serious problems this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/&amp;xcust=1-1-1682239-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s System Status page</a> on Thursday, the Weather app had “ongoing” issues with “slow or unreliable” service since 11:27 am ET Thursday following several issues earlier in the week. On Wednesday night, there were also <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672629/imessage-not-working-how-to-fix-imessage-on-iphone-ipad-mac.html\">issues with iMessage</a> and iCloud, as noted by numerous complaints on Twitter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After more than half a day of intermittent outages, the service was restored on Tuesday, though on Wednesday morning the issue returned. Apple’s status page says the app was fixed as of Tuesday afternoon and then again Wednesday morning, but on Thursday it went down again. Clearly, the Weather app itself needs a larger fix, which likely won’t come until next week at the earliest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple notes that “some users are affected,” but based on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/__Casanova_____/status/1643224924616523777&amp;xcust=1-1-1682239-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">anecdotal</a> <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/cocolileeee/status/1641891732051853312&amp;xcust=1-1-1682239-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">evidence</a>—including Macworld’s own experience—the issue appeared to be quite widespread. It also appears to affect the Weather widget, which continues to display “No weather data” even when the weather is properly loaded in the app. We also experienced outages on Wednesday morning even after Apple claimed the issue was fixed, and again on Thursday. We had better luck with the Weather app in macOS Ventura, but at least one Macworld reader said they experienced the same issues on the Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple responded to queries on Twitter with a message saying they are “currently working on a solution for the Weather app outage and will post an update online.” Later in the afternoon, Apple’s status page was all green and the warning indicator had been lifted, though it quickly cropped up again.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Thank you for your patience. We are currently working on a solution for the Weather app outage and will post an update online here: <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/waNYZdXpJm&amp;xcust=1-1-1682239-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">https://t.co/waNYZdXpJm</a> <br /><br />Please send us a Direct Message if you have any additional questions. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/GDrqU22YpT&amp;xcust=1-1-1682239-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">https://t.co/GDrqU22YpT</a></p>— Apple Support (@AppleSupport) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/AppleSupport/status/1643263340276326405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-1682239-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">April 4, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Macworld staffers have experienced on-and-off issues with the Weather app over the past several weeks. At times, the app is slow to load or doesn’t load at all. Quitting the app and relaunching has been a quick workaround, but even that doesn’t always work. So while Apple has given us the green light (literally, it’s no longer yellow on Apple’s status page) it’s not clear if there isn’t a need for a larger fix to the app. Some reports suggested that an <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/04/ios-16-4-1-expected-soon/&amp;xcust=1-1-1682239-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">iOS 16.4.1 update</a> could be imminent to fix the underlying issue. Apple doesn’t update its apps independently from the system, so any fix will need to arrive as part of a larger iOS update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, it’s not the end of the world since there are numerous ways to get weather conditions and forecasts on your phone. However, after Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1440719/dark-app-weather-app-shutting-down-january-1.html\">shuttered the popular Dark Sky app</a> on January 1, the stock iOS Weather app—which picked up many of the Dark Sky features in iOS 16—is likely the go-to source for weather information for many more users.</p>\n\niOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"1c68f4a2e421f2d3e0bda45df976b1bad8a99bd69ef5e5b14bc551faf548eece","category":"Apple"}
