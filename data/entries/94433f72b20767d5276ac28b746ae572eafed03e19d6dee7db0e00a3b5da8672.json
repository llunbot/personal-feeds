The judge overseeing the case said that because the defect appeared after the warranty period, Apple was not required to disclose it because it was not a safety issue.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the lawsuit has been dismissed, the judge is allowing it to be amended. Plaintiffs will need to include an argument that the ‌Flexgate‌ issue was a safety hazard, as well as providing evidence that Apple \"knew with certainty that the alleged defect would occur.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌Flexgate‌ problem affected MacBook Pro models released in 2016 and 2017, some of which began <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/flexgate-macbook-pro-display-issue/\">exhibiting uneven lighting</a> at the bottom of the screen after a few years. This \"stage light\" effect could lead the backlighting system to fail entirely.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRepair site iFixit found that the problem was caused by a delicate flex cable that was prone to wearing out and breaking after repeated opening and closing of the display.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/05/apple-flexgate-possible-fix/\">updated the design</a> of the display flex cable with the 2018 MacBook Pro, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/21/apple-backlight-service-program-macbook-pro/\">launched a free repair program</a> in May 2019 that covered the 13-inch MacBook Pro models from 2016.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe now-dismissed class action lawsuit was seeking restitution for all costs attributable to repairing or replacing affected MacBook Pro models, and it called on Apple to expand the free repair program to cover 15-inch MacBook Pro models.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/\">lawsuit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/flexgate/\">Flexgate</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/flexgate-class-action-lawsuit-dismissed/\">'Flexgate' Class Action Lawsuit Over Faulty MacBook Pro Displays Dismissed by Judge</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/flexgate-class-action-lawsuit-over-faulty-macbook-pro-displays-dismissed-by-judge.2304932/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=SLQ1DcYC870:_2ejlteMJUo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=SLQ1DcYC870:_2ejlteMJUo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/SLQ1DcYC870\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"94433f72b20767d5276ac28b746ae572eafed03e19d6dee7db0e00a3b5da8672","category":"Apple"}
