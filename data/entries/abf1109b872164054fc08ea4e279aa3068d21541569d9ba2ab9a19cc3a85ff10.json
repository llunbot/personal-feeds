All existing MacBook \nAir and MacBook Pro models are equipped with M2 series chips, so \nany new models would presumably be equipped with M3 chips, which \neffectively means that Kuo does not expect any new MacBooks at all \nfor the rest of 2023. </p>\n\n<p>Earlier this week, Kuo added that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/24-inch-imac-2024-launch/\">24-inch iMac would be \nupdated next in 2024</a>, ruling out an update to the \nall-in-one desktop computer this year. All other desktop Macs, \nincluding the Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro, were already \nupdated in 2023 and are highly unlikely to be updated again until \n2024 or later. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But then <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-apple-to-announce-new-macs-this-month/\">here’s Hartley Charlton on the latest from Mark Gurman</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple is planning a Mac-focused product launch, likely including \nthe announcement of a refreshed 24-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, for the end \nof this month, Bloomberg’s <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p\">Mark Gurman reports</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In the latest edition of his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p\">“Power On” newsletter</a>, Gurman \nsaid that Apple is “planning a Mac-centered product launch around \nthe end of this month” that could see the the release of a \nrefreshed 24-inch iMac model, which is long overdue a hardware \nupdate. The current model launched in April 2021 and it is the \nonly current-generation Mac left with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip. Gurman \nhas repeatedly said that Apple’s next <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/06/no-m2-imac-on-the-horizon-for-2022/\">iMac will skip the \nM2</a> and feature the M3 chip instead, but he declined to \nmention which chip the new machine will feature in this \nnewsletter. </p>\n\n<p>Gurman noted that Apple retail stores are now in short supply of \nthe iMac, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro, \nand many configurations now will not arrive until mid-November, in \nwhat he believes is “a clear sign that something is about to \nhappen” regarding these three machines. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Claim chowder tastes great with a side of popcorn.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/apple-rumor-pundit-thunderdome\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"abf1109b872164054fc08ea4e279aa3068d21541569d9ba2ab9a19cc3a85ff10","category":"Tech"}
