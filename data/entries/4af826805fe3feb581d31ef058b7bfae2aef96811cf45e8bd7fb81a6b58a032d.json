But the resulting Windows installation is a lot less \"clean\" than it used to be, given the continual creep of new Microsoft apps and services into more and more parts of the core Windows experience.</p>\n\n<p>I frequently write about Windows, Edge, and other Microsoft-adjacent technologies as part of my day job, and I sign into my daily-use PCs with a Microsoft account, so my usage patterns may be atypical for many Ars Technica readers. But for anyone who uses Windows, Edge, or both, I thought it might be useful to detail what I'm doing to clean up a clean install of Windows, minimizing (if not totally eliminating) the number of annoying notifications, Microsoft services, and unasked-for apps that we have to deal with.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000668#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000668&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4af826805fe3feb581d31ef058b7bfae2aef96811cf45e8bd7fb81a6b58a032d","category":"Tech"}
