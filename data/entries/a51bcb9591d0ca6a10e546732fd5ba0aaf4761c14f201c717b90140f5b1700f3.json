Sometimes this is just random bug fixes where Apple doesn’t even tell you what’s fixed. Other times, it enables new features when used in conjunction with Apple’s other products (iPhone, iPad, Macs, even Apple TV).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your AirPods should update their firmware automatically, without intervention, as long as they’re charging and within Bluetooth range of the iPhone, iPad, or Mac to which they’re connected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no way to “force” an update the way you manually download iOS or Mac updates, but there are steps you can take to help trigger it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to update AirPods on iPhone, iPad, or Mac</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p>Make sure that your AirPods are in Bluetooth range of your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Make sure that device is connected to Wi-Fi.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Put your AirPods in their charging case and close the lid.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Plug in the charging case (plug the USB cable into a power adapter and the charging case).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keep the lid of the charging case closed. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wait at least 30 minutes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the lid of the charging case to reconnect your AirPods to your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Check the firmware version again. </li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to check the firmware version of your AirPods</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On iPhone or iPad:</strong> With your AirPods nearby and the case open, open <em>Settings</em> on your iPhone or iPad. You’ll see your AirPods listed at the top of Settings. Tap that, and scroll down to the bottom of your AirPods settings to see the Version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On Mac: </strong>Open <em>System Settings</em>. Select <em>Bluetooth</em>, then click the (i) next to your connected AirPods. The Version will be listed there, along with other information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple lists the latest firmware version for each model of AirPods on the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/106340#latest\">AirPods Firmware support page</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to update AirPods on Android</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can’t! AirPods firmware can only be updated with a connected Apple device.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>AirPods Pro 2 USB-C</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1218\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/61sRKTAfrhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AirPods Pro 2 USB-C\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/61sRKTAfrhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1218w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/61sRKTAfrhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=244%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 244w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/61sRKTAfrhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=768%2C946&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/61sRKTAfrhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=974%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 974w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1207444/airpods-pro-2-review-2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$249\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1787391-REG/apple_mtjv3am_a_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html/BI/21318/KBID/22251/DFF/d10-v21-t1-x1656148/SID/pocketlint-squirrel\" target=\"_blank\">$219 at  B&amp;H</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHWRXH8B?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">$224 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTJV3AM/A/airpods-pro\" target=\"_blank\">$249 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a51bcb9591d0ca6a10e546732fd5ba0aaf4761c14f201c717b90140f5b1700f3","category":"Apple"}
