Fresh off last week's dramatic test flight of SpaceX's Starship, teams in Texas are wasting no time gearing up for the next launch. Ground crews are replacing the entire heat shield on the next Starship spacecraft to overcome deficiencies identified on last week's flight. SpaceX has a whole lot to accomplish with Starship in the next several months if NASA is going to land astronauts on the Moon by the end of 2026.</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site).

That's because Colglazier and Virgin Galactic are betting it all on the development of a future \"Delta class\" of spaceships modeled on VSS<em> Unity, </em>which made its last flight to suborbital space Saturday. Virgin Galactic, founded by Richard Branson, now finds itself at a crossroads as it chases profitability, which VSS<em> Unity </em>had no hope of helping it achieve despite two decades of development and billions of dollars spent.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031555#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031555&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"083419f32c3fe13e8899be3641107babb62485879d9d8f3c61fd7393d67b7973","category":"Tech"}
