However, Parallels has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/01/windows-11-on-mac-parallels-desktop/\">promised</a> that when Windows 11 is officially released to the public, the virtualization software will be able to run it.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith that caveat, for both ‌M1‌ and Intel systems, Parallels 17 resumes Windows and Linux up to 38% faster compared to the previous version, and benefits from a sixfold increase in OpenGL graphics processing and up to a 25% improvement in 2D graphics performance, according to the company. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf you're running it on an Apple silicon machine, expect 33% faster Windows startup times, up to 20% better disk performance on Windows 10 Insider Preview, and up to 28% faster DirectX 11 performance. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nElsewhere, Parallels has improved its Coherence mode, which lets you run a windows app without launching the full virtual machine. Coherence will now window shutdowns, updates, and sign-in screens, while drag-and-drop between Windows and Mac apps has been enhanced, with support for dragging text and images between windows, including support for Quick Notes in Monterey. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌M1‌ users can also now use BitLocker and Secure Boot thanks to a virtualized TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip. Windows 10 will also recognize macOS battery status and turn on battery saving mode when your Mac runs low on battery. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nParallels Desktop 17 has moved entirely to a subscription model, which means the standard edition costs $79.99 per year, while Pro and Business Editions are available for $99.99 per year. Users who purchased a perpetual license for an earlier version of Parallels Desktop can upgrade to Parallels Desktop 17 for $49.99.
