In games of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Trumps\"><em>Top Trumps</em></a>, the V12 might have been king, but a rotary was a joker, a wild card. A lack of mainstream success no doubt contributes; there are reasons they were never commonplace, including their oil-burning apex seals, which created emissions and fuel-consumption headaches.</p>\n<p>LiquidPiston thinks it has those problems solved, however, and in the process, it created a new internal combustion engine that's small and efficient. It has demonstrated its tech on the bench and in a go-kart, but also in uncrewed aerial vehicles for the US military.</p>\n<p>While little about the rotary engine merits the word, in a \"traditional\" Wankel rotary, a triangle-shaped rotor turns within a chamber during its combustion cycle. Apex seals are fitted at the apices of the rotor, but they need constant lubrication with oil, plenty of which burns during combustion. So, a Wankel engine needs constant oil top-ups while dealing with the products of that burnt oil. And those apex seals wear down.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983309#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983309&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
