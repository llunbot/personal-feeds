But right now <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLT98Q7/?th=1\">you can get one for a Black Friday bargain of just $259</a>, the very best price we’ve ever seen. That’s a 26 percent discount and an insane deal for a great tablet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With an A14 Bionic chip, this tablet is ready to help you tackle games, streaming, and even some of your workload since you can easily use it with a Magic Keyboard. This 10.9-inch tablet features a Liquid Retina Display with vibrant colors and deep contrasts for a great visual experience. The battery life on this tablet is described as “all-day,” which we don’t necessarily agree with, as per the tests we ran during <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1371039/ipad-10th-generation-review.html\">our review of the iPad 10th gen</a>. Either way, it should be enough to get you through quite a few hours of fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all those moments when you need to participate in video calls, the iPad features a 12MP Ultra Wide front camera with Center Stage, keeping the focus on you even if you move around. There’s also a 12MP Wide back camera if you want to snap some pics or videos here and there. The only thing it doesn’t have is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a>, but with a slow roll-out, you’re not going to be missing out on too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go ahead and add the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLT98Q7/?th=1\">10th-gen iPad to your cart for just $259</a> because once Black Friday is over this deal will be too.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLT98Q7/?th=1\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d3bd7d55bbfa3a0cb684cd05d1bffa19be73f20e2b49034d5d00262175c04aab","category":"Apple"}
