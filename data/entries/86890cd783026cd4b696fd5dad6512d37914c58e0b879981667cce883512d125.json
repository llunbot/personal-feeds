Apple is planning to refresh the MacBook Pro, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> with M4 chips this year, and we could see the new models sometime in October.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/M4-Mac-mini-Black-Ortho-Cooler.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe four machines have base-level M4 chips, according to developer logs. Three of the Macs have a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU. The fourth machine has an 8-core CPU and an 8-core GPU, which is not an M4 configuration that we've seen so far. All four of the M4 Macs have either 16GB or 32GB of Unified Memory.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe M4 used in the 256GB and 512GB <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models has a 9-core CPU and 10-core GPU, while the chip used in the 1TB and 2TB models has a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU. The high-end <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> chip is the same chip that will be in some of the Mac models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman does not mention M4 Pro or M4 Max chips, which would be used in higher-end ‌Mac mini‌ and 14-inch MacBook Pro models, as well as the 16-inch MacBook Pro. M4 Pro and M4 Max chips would have a higher number of CPU and GPU cores, as well as more maximum memory.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is not clear if Apple is only introducing lower-end models with the standard M4 chip, or if there are plans for M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max models but those higher-end chips simply weren't seen in the developer logs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPrior rumors have suggested that both the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models would see a refresh, and Gurman previously said that the new, slimmer ‌Mac mini‌ that's in the works <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/mac-mini-to-become-smallest-ever-apple-computer/\">will be available</a> with both M4 and M4 Pro chip options.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 14 &amp; 16\" </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/23/apple-testing-four-m4-macs/\">Apple Testing Four New M4 Macs Ahead of Fall Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-testing-four-new-m4-macs-ahead-of-fall-launch.2434245/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"86890cd783026cd4b696fd5dad6512d37914c58e0b879981667cce883512d125","category":"Apple"}
