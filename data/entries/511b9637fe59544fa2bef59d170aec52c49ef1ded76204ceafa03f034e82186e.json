As recently as last night, Carlson appeared alongside Trump on stage in Arizona — an event at which <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-says-liz-cheney-might-not-be-such-a-war-hawk-if-she-had-rifles-shooting-at-her\">Trump suggested Liz Cheney should face a firing squad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Carlson was never hooked up right. And eventually when you’re not hooked up right and you don’t get help, the loose screws start falling out.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/01/tucker-carlson-nuts\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"511b9637fe59544fa2bef59d170aec52c49ef1ded76204ceafa03f034e82186e","category":"Tech"}
