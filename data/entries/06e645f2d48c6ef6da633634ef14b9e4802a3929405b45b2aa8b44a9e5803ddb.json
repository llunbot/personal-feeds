Name ring a bell? If you’re a long-time reader of <em>Cyclist</em> the chances are it does, as Feather has popped up on a number of occasions. You’ll know we’ve covered his acclaimed framebuilding business in Yorkshire, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/me-and-my-bike-ricky-feather\">Feather Cycles</a>, and featured several of his award-winning handbuilt bikes over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you might not know is that Feather’s lifelong obsession with bikes started not with 700c wheels, but 20-inch ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The moment I threw my leg over a BMX bike I was obsessed,’ Feather says. ‘I knocked football on the head almost immediately and all I did for about 12 years straight was ride BMX. It took me around the world: the States and all over Europe, just from BMX trips.’</p>\n\n\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-02-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Meet the maker Ricky Feather Wkndr\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-02-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-02-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-02-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-02-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-02-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-02-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-02-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-02-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-02.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Alex Wright/Teneight</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Feather’s earliest memories are all bike-related. He remembers fibbing about riding without stabilisers at the age of three, and the time a friend of his dad’s hoisted him onto an old racer – his first proper go in the saddle, even if he couldn’t reach the pedals yet. Feather’s interest in the practical side of bikes came later, but it altered the course of his life when it did eventually arrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘My family weren’t really into bikes or cycling at all, so I was really lucky that my grandad was practical. He showed me the ropes when it came to fixing bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The framebuilding came about for a few different reasons. I worked as a welder but my travels with the BMX showed me that it was possible to make a living doing something creative. I saw interesting people doing interesting jobs and realised that life could be more than working in a factory. Growing up where I did, I didn’t have a clue that was even an option. I remember reading an article in a magazine about a young American framebuilder. That was the spark that lit the fire.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-03-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Meet the maker Ricky Feather Wkndr\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-03-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-03-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-03-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-03-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-03-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-03-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-03-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-03-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-03.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Ricky Feather is well-known for his beautiful hand-built custom bikes, but his WKNDR range comprises all-road bikes that you don’t have to keep for Sunday best.</figcaption><figcaption>Alex Wright/Teneight</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It has now been 16 years since Feather set up his eponymous custom framebuilding operation. In that time his painstakingly handcrafted bikes have garnered lots of positive attention, including a number of industry awards. As such, you could argue a Feather Cycles bike is almost too good to ride all the time – the kind of bike you save for perfect conditions and smooth roads. That, Feather explains, is where Wkndr comes in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I wanted to offer something that was still high quality but a bit more of a tool – more affordable, less admin, but that would still put smiles on faces.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-2-970x332.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-2-970x332.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-2-300x103.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-2-768x263.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-2-1536x526.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-2-2048x701.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-2-750x257.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-2-1140x390.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>So Feather started making TIG-welded all-road bikes for himself and friends on the weekends. They were a hit, so much so that last year Feather decided to launch Wkndr as a brand in its own right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The first ever Wkndr customer, an established bike-fitter, claimed our introductory all-road option, Omne, is the nicest bike he’s ever ridden. In fact he ordered another bike from us almost immediately afterwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s such a versatile bike. Amazing for the winter, but also perfect for the gravel we have here in North Yorkshire. It basically ticks all the boxes that I wanted from a four-season bike.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-04-647x970.webp\" alt=\"Meet the maker Ricky Feather Wkndr\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-04-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-04-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-04-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-04-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-04-1365x2048.webp 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-04-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-04-1140x1710.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-04.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Alex Wright/Teneight</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The bike pictured here is the Omne i, the bells-and-whistles version of the Omne from Wkndr’s premium range, boasting neatly integrated cables for a racier, more streamlined look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It has slightly more relaxed geometry than your typical road bike,’ says Feather. ‘It’s incredibly comfortable on the road without being sluggish, but it really comes to life on gravel. I’ve ridden my own to some respectable times in a few gravel events over the last couple of years, and I’ve been loving our winters on the tarmac too.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/russell-stout-cycles\">Meet the maker: Russell Stout of Stout Cycles</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/medusa-cycles-pete-skelton\">Meet the maker: Pete Skelton of Medusa Cycles</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/havren-frameworks-chris-roberts\">Meet the maker: Chris Roberts of Havren Frameworks</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/adrian-hogan-feather-custom-bike\">What we ride: Adrian’s custom Feather all-road bike</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/me-and-my-bike-ricky-feather\">Me and my bike: Ricky Feather</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Ahead of the curve</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Connoisseurs have no doubt spotted the distinctive curved seatstays, which Feather says have a range of purposes aside from simply looking pretty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I call them the hourglass seatstays. They add a little bit of spring to the back end and allow clearance for 40mm tyres, but they also have that interesting appearance, something I think is important to differentiate my bikes from the masses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Each bike is slightly different as I bend the stays individually by hand for each size using two different old rims to achieve the required shape.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tubeset is a mix of Columbus Zona and Life with British-made dropouts and a BB shell from Bear Frame Supplies. The Wkndr frames have Feather’s own bottle boss design, with a larger flange to reduce stress on the down tube from repeatedly removing and replacing bidons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Componentry-wise, Feather says the goal was to reduce faff and make everything as reliable as possible.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-05-647x970.webp\" alt=\"Meet the maker Ricky Feather Wkndr\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-05-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-05-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-05-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-05-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-05-1365x2048.webp 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-05-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-05-1140x1710.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/meet-the-maker-ricky-feather-wkndr-05.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Alex Wright/Teneight</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘I work on bikes full time, so the last thing I want to do in my spare time is work on my bike. Understandably this steers away from affordability, but long term it requires less time in the workshop.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For an OMNEi in the exact spec shown here, Feather says the pricetag is around £9,200. Compared to a custom Feather, that could be saving as much as £3,000 on a comparable build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘That’s what makes Wkndr a great option for those who want to throw a bit more money on the finishing touches. It’s cash that would otherwise be swallowed up by the frame build and custom paint alone on a Feather.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prospective customers might want to get in quick, however.
