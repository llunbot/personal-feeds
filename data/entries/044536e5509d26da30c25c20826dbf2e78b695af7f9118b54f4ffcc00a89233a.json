Today, AI tools like <a href=\"https://www.suno.ai/\">Suno.ai</a> allow any series of words to become song lyrics, including inside jokes (as you'll see below). On Wednesday, prompt engineer Riley Goodside <a href=\"https://x.com/goodside/status/1775713487529922702\">tweeted</a> an AI-generated song created with the prompt \"sad girl with piano performs the text of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License\">MIT License</a>,\" and it began to circulate widely in the AI community online.</p>\n<p>The MIT License is a famous permissive software license created in the late 1980s, frequently used in open source projects. \"My favorite part of this is ~1:25 it nails 'WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY' with a beautiful Imogen Heap-style glissando then immediately pronounces 'FITNESS' as 'fistiff,'\" Goodside <a href=\"https://x.com/goodside/status/1775736282586427632\">wrote</a> on X.</p>\n<figure>\n    <div>\n            </div>\n    </figure>\n<p>Suno (which means \"listen\" in Hindi) was formed in 2023 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Suno has already attracted big-name partners, such as Microsoft, which <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/19/24008279/microsoft-copilot-suno-ai-music-generator-extension\">announced</a> the integration of an earlier version of the Suno engine into Bing Chat last December. Today, Suno is on v3 of its model, which can create temporally coherent two-minute songs in many different genres.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015379#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015379&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"044536e5509d26da30c25c20826dbf2e78b695af7f9118b54f4ffcc00a89233a","category":"Tech"}
