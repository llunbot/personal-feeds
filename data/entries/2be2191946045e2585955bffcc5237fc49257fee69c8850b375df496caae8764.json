We explore how the Macintosh's ease of use and innovative design principles, such as a desktop with icons and the ability to use multiple programs in windows, revolutionized personal computing. Reflecting on the Mac's journey, we delve into the evolution of macOS and its remarkable consistency over the years, and point out some of our personal experiences with the platform.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nShifting gears, we discuss the imminent launch of Apple's Vision Pro headset, examining some of the potential challenges it may face and the reasons behind the absence of certain streaming apps like Netflix. We ponder whether this absence is due to genuine technical hurdles or strategic decisions by these companies.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe then turn to the latest updates and challenges surrounding Apple's electric vehicle project, looking at how the company has reportedly pivoted from its initial ambition for a driverless car to developing a vehicle with more conventional and basic driver-assistance features. As we wrap up, we dive into the broader context of electric vehicles, discussing our wish for Apple's car to offer a fresh perspective, moving beyond Tesla's design approach to introduce more variety to the market.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/\">The MacRumors Show</a> is now <strong>exclusively</strong> on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow\">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips going forward:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1\"><div>Subscribe to The MacRumors Show's new YouTube channel!</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can also listen to ‌The MacRumors Show‌ on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/id1602394741\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/41XOHIA6w8IxAKJZvrnx90\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/itunes1602394741\">Overcast</a>, or your preferred podcasts app. You can also <a href=\"https://audioboom.com/channels/5096144.rss\">copy our RSS feed</a> directly into your podcast player.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nIf you haven't already listened to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/the-macrumors-show-apple-vision-pro-pre-orders/\">previous episode of The MacRumors Show</a>, catch up for our discussion about <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/\">CES 2024</a>, Samsung's S24 lineup, and some of the latest news surrounding Apple's Vision Pro headset.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSubscribe to ‌The MacRumors Show‌ for new episodes every week, where we discuss some of the topical news breaking here on <em>MacRumors</em>, often joined by interesting guests like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/24/the-macrumors-show-kevin-nether-talks-iphone-16/\">Kevin Nether</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/10/the-macrumors-show-apple-gaming-ft-toucharcade/\">Jared Nelson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/10/the-macrumors-show-apple-gaming-ft-toucharcade/\">Eli Hodapp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/20/the-macrumors-show-luke-miani-talks-future-of-ipad/\">Luke Miani</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/the-macrumors-show-former-apple-executive-mike-bell/\">Mike Bell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/06/the-macrumors-show-sara-dietschy-apple-accessories/\">Sara Dietschy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/the-macrumors-show-ijustine-talks-iphone-15/\">iJustine</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/25/the-macrumors-show-iphone-15-jon-rettinger/\">Jon Rettinger</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/10/the-macrumors-show-andru-edwards-iphone-ultra/\">Andru Edwards</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/26/the-macrumors-show-arnold-kim/\">Arnold Kim</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/19/the-macrumors-show-ben-sullins-apple-car/\">Ben Sullins</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/07/the-macrumors-show-marcus-kane-headset-design/\">Marcus Kane</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/24/the-macrumors-show-christopher-lawley-talks-ipados/\">Christopher Lawley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/the-macrumors-show-frank-mcshan-yellow-iphone-14/\">Frank McShan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/24/the-macrumors-show-david-lewis-talks-apple-audio/\">David Lewis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/27/the-macrumors-show-tyler-stalman-new-macs/\">Tyler Stalman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/23/the-macrumors-show-apple-2022-jon-prosser-sam-kohl/\">Jon Prosser</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/02/the-macrumors-show-apple-event-expectations/\">Sam Kohl</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/16/the-macrumors-show-quinn-nelson-iphone-15-rumors/\">Quinn Nelson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/09/the-macrumors-show-john-gruber-talks-macos-ventura/\">John Gruber</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/28/the-macrumors-show-ipados-16-ft-federico-viticci/\">Federico Viticci</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/26/the-macrumors-show-thomas-frank-talks-productivity/\">Thomas Frank</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/21/the-macrumors-show-jonathan-morrison/\">Jonathan Morrison</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/12/the-macrumors-show-ross-young/\">Ross Young</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/21/the-macrumors-show-ian-zelbo/\">Ian Zelbo</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/25/the-macrumors-show-rene-ritchie-talks-mac-studio/\">Rene Ritchie</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌The MacRumors Show‌ is on X <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorsshow\">@MacRumorsShow</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorsshow\"></a>, so be sure to give us a follow to keep up with the podcast.
