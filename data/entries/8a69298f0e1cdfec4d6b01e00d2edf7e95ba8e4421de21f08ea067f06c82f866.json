Why are you in a bunker? If you have a bunker, you’re fruity enough to have heaps of supplies – so it’s a question of how long you think you’ll need to be in the bunker versus how overstocked on supplies you are. Will you make it that long with an extra person eating their way through your stuff, until starvation – or more likely, dehydration – kills you? Or are you in it for the long haul, hiding out for a bit and then trying to survive in the world?”</em> – Petor Georgallou, 2025, X years before societal collapse.</p>\n<p>As a refresher, <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2025-bespoked-apocalypse-build-off/\" target=\"_blank\">we posted the Bespoked announcement</a> when the competition was announced, but I can break it down again.

As he’s requesting this, my anxiety took over. “I’m not here to crown any one specific project; I don’t want to make enemies at the show” was my initial thought. We walked up the staircase to the mezanine level in the Victoria Baths, and my mind melted.</p>\n<p>“NOW THIS IS A FUCKIN’ BIKE SHOW!” I thought to myself. Truth told, not since I went to <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/bike-kill-20/\" target=\"_blank\">Bike Kill</a> in 2007 in Brooklyn had I seen such ingenuity and ridiculousness on display.</p>\n<p>In a proper apocalypse mindset, all rules were off. I wanted to see practicality. My mind began to run through a list of no-brainers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fat bike tires? Give me a break! You can’t survive with a fat bike. You can’t even find fat bike tires in bike shops today!</li>\n<li>It had to be nimble to evade hordes of aliens/zombies/cannibals</li>\n<li>The bike cannot be flashy. It’ll attract attention. It needs to be able to be hidden in plain sight.</li>\n<li>Standard wheel bases limit carrying capacity. I wanted it to be a cargo bike of some sort.</li>\n<li>Even with a limited budget, it should have a dynamo for lighting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Apocalypse-Build-Off-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Apocalypse-Build-Off-12.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Apocalypse-Build-Off-12.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Apocalypse-Build-Off-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Apocalypse-Build-Off-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Apocalypse-Build-Off-16.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Apocalypse-Build-Off-16.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Apocalypse-Build-Off-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Making my way around the exhibitors, I found some clever ideas on display. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/seabasscycles/\" target=\"_blank\">Seabass Cycles</a>, for example, had a shotgun holster, a cutting board, and a grill setup for shooting pheasants or game birds, dressing, and grilling.

Freak/weird/cobbled/shit bikes like this are indicative of how they can be fun and completely absurd at the same time. This sideshow broke up the showcase’s indoor vibes and brought the audience outside to engage. More bike shows ought to have actual bike riding. Even though young children missed a handlebar by but inches during the race, times like this are fun for the whole family.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Apocalypse-Build-Off-27.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Apocalypse-Build-Off-27.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Apocalypse-Build-Off-27.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Apocalypse-Build-Off-27.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>In the end, what each of these builders, shops, and people displayed was a creative mind, clever problem-solving, and the ability to think beyond the confines of a bike show, all while having a wicked good time.
