Since then, the 24-inch iMac has been Apple's only all-in-one desktop computer, with no larger model available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iMac-Pro-2022-27-and-24-iMac.jpg\" width=\"1626\" height=\"914\" />\r<br />\nWill a larger iMac ever make a comeback? We recap the latest rumors below.\r<br />\n \r<br />\nIn November, Apple announced that it had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/no-27-inch-with-apple-silicon/\">no plans to release a new version of the 27-inch iMac</a> with an Apple silicon chip. Instead, Apple recommended pairing its standalone Studio Display with its Mac Studio or Mac mini desktop computers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's statement ruled out a new 27-inch iMac, but an even larger model is still possible one day. Nearly a year ago, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/new-32-inch-imac-pro-expected-2024-or-2025/\">both <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/\">Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said Apple was developing a 32-inch iMac for release in late 2024 or in 2025. Kuo said the larger iMac's screen would feature mini-LED backlighting, which would allow for increased brightness, higher contrast ratio, and other benefits compared to LCD technology.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile there haven't been any rumors lately about this alleged 32-inch iMac, Gurman said Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-still-working-on-larger-imac/\">still exploring a larger iMac</a> as recently as August.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"A larger iMac remains something Apple is exploring as well, but it's unclear if that will be an M4 product or something that comes the following year or later,\" he wrote.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThat is all that is known about a potential larger iMac at this point.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll in all, it seems that a larger iMac might be on Apple's roadmap, but the wait continues for now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the meantime, the 24-inch iMac is expected to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/15/m4-macs-and-new-ipads-at-next-apple-event/\">updated with the M4 chip in October</a>, alongside new MacBook Pro and Mac mini models.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/24/will-apple-bring-back-a-larger-imac/\">Will Apple Bring Back a Larger iMac?
