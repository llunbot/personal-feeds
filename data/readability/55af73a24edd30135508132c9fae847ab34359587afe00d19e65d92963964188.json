A winter cycling jacket is an important piece for any cyclist who’s hoping to spend more time on the bike in temperatures hovering around and below freezing.</p><p>Not only will a good winter cycling jacket keep you warm, it will allow you to wear fewer layers underneath, leaving you with more mobility in your upper body. While layering helps keep you warm, too many jerseys and baselayers can end up wreaking havoc on your circulation to your hands.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pactimo-winter-riding-kit-review-on-the-bike-01.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pactimo-winter-riding-kit-review-on-the-bike-01.jpg\" alt=\"pactimo vertex winter jacket and storm plus winter long sleeve jersey and bib tights\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pactimo-winter-riding-kit-review-on-the-bike-01.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pactimo-winter-riding-kit-review-on-the-bike-01-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pactimo-winter-riding-kit-review-on-the-bike-01-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pactimo-winter-riding-kit-review-on-the-bike-01-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pactimo-winter-riding-kit-review-on-the-bike-01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pactimo-winter-riding-kit-review-on-the-bike-01-696x464.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pactimo-winter-riding-kit-review-on-the-bike-01-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pactimo-winter-riding-kit-review-on-the-bike-01-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>So, if you love cold weather riding, it’s time to invest in a good winter cycling jacket. We’ve rounded up the best options for aero-conscious road riders, mountain bikers and fat bikers, adventure riders who want a bit more space to move around, and even safety- and fashion-conscious bike commuters.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27131547/rapha-winter-cycling-jackets-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27131547/rapha-winter-cycling-jackets-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27131547/rapha-winter-cycling-jackets-2.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27131547/rapha-winter-cycling-jackets-2-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27131547/rapha-winter-cycling-jackets-2-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27131547/rapha-winter-cycling-jackets-2-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27131547/rapha-winter-cycling-jackets-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27131547/rapha-winter-cycling-jackets-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>And good news: Many brands have gotten the message that women need winter cycling jackets just as much as men do, so most of these options are available in both men and women’s cuts and sizes. Some brands, like Velocio, even start with the women’s iteration first and then bring in offerings for men.</p><h2>Best Winter Road Cycling Jackets</h2><h3><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=24deaafc-a11f-4e4e-9224-294083d5b322&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pactimo.com%2Fcollections%2Fmens-cycling-jackets%2Fproducts%2Falpine-winter-cycling-thermal-jacket-mens&amp;ctc=xid:fr1636429350223cjh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-orig-url=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=24deaafc-a11f-4e4e-9224-294083d5b322&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pactimo.com%2Fcollections%2Fmens-cycling-jackets%2Fproducts%2Falpine-winter-cycling-thermal-jacket-mens\" data-ml-id=\"0\" data-ml=\"true\" data-xid=\"fr1636429350223cjh\"><span>&nbsp;Pactimo Alpine Thermal Jacket&nbsp;</span></a></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175451/pactimo-alpine-winter-cycling-jacket.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175451/pactimo-alpine-winter-cycling-jacket.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175451/pactimo-alpine-winter-cycling-jacket.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175451/pactimo-alpine-winter-cycling-jacket-297x149.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175451/pactimo-alpine-winter-cycling-jacket-800x400.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175451/pactimo-alpine-winter-cycling-jacket-120x60.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175451/pactimo-alpine-winter-cycling-jacket-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p>The basic <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=24deaafc-a11f-4e4e-9224-294083d5b322&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pactimo.com%2Fcollections%2Fmens-cycling-jackets%2Fproducts%2Falpine-winter-cycling-thermal-jacket-mens&amp;ctc=xid:fr1636429350223dhf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-orig-url=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=24deaafc-a11f-4e4e-9224-294083d5b322&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pactimo.com%2Fcollections%2Fmens-cycling-jackets%2Fproducts%2Falpine-winter-cycling-thermal-jacket-mens\" data-ml-id=\"1\" data-ml=\"true\" data-xid=\"fr1636429350223dhf\">Alpine Jacket</a> from Pactimo is one of our top favorites for its simplicity, its wide range of men’s and women’s sizes, and the variety of colors it’s available in. Designed for riding in temperatures between 15° and 40° F, this softshell jacket is brushed with a water-resistant coating for those drizzly days (or road spray).</p><p>It has three pockets – two wide ones like a standard jersey, plus a zippered, water-resistant one for your valuables. Some winter cycling coats skip pockets or skimp on them, but to us, normal jersey-style pocket access is key. We also appreciate the little details as well: reflective accents, soft cuffs that work well with thick winter gloves, and a dropped tail to keep your bum dry. Pactimo runs a lot of great sales, so you can often score this jacket at a great price, though even at full retail, it’s a good deal.

The sizing is similar to the rest of the Classic line: A bit more relaxed, but still sporty, so you’ll be able to move and breathe comfortably in this coat, and fit a jersey and/or baselayer underneath with no problem.</p><p>We appreciate the front zippered pocket for stashing a phone, while back pockets mimic a long sleeve jersey with easy access. We also love the two-way zip so if a ride gets warmer than expected, you can unzip from the top or bottom for ventilation. The style is simple, classic, and will last for years of riding.</p><ul><li>Material details: GORE-TEX INFINIUM, 40% Polyester, 34% Nylon, 26% ePTFE</li><li>Available in: Men, Women</li><li>Sizes: Men—XS – XXL / Women—XXS – XL</li><li>Colors: Navy, orange (plus blue in Men’s)</li><li>MSRP: $370</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Will last for years<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Pricey</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=92594cfb-2b30-40ba-ab76-f9c20ed4612c&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-alpha-ros-2-jacket-mens&amp;ctc=xid:fr1636429350223hii\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-orig-url=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=92594cfb-2b30-40ba-ab76-f9c20ed4612c&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-alpha-ros-2-jacket-mens\" data-ml-id=\"7\" data-ml=\"true\" data-xid=\"fr1636429350223hii\"><span>&nbsp;Castelli Alpha Ros 2&nbsp;</span></a></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175441/castelli-ros-2-winter-cycling-jacket.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175441/castelli-ros-2-winter-cycling-jacket.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175441/castelli-ros-2-winter-cycling-jacket.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175441/castelli-ros-2-winter-cycling-jacket-297x149.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175441/castelli-ros-2-winter-cycling-jacket-800x400.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175441/castelli-ros-2-winter-cycling-jacket-120x60.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175441/castelli-ros-2-winter-cycling-jacket-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p>Castelli has always been the brand to turn to for winter riding, from head to toe, and their jackets are no exception. On any winter group ride, you’re likely to see a Castelli coat making an appearance.</p><p>Like Rapha’s jacket, the Alpha Ros 2 uses Gore-Tex Infinium fabric to provide the best windproofing while also offering water resistance. We appreciate that unlike the other jackets that have two main back pockets, this one actually has three, making it more similar to a traditional jersey.</p><p>The double-layer cuff detail means your glove can seamlessly fit between the cuffs to avoid that awkward wind leak effect that can happen with some glove/jacket combos. And the silicone grip in the back ensures that you won’t be subjected to the annoying ‘ride up’ that can happen with some jackets. It’s lightweight at 454 grams, and rated for rides between 23° and 50°F, though with more layers underneath, it can work in even colder temps. Available in both men’s and women’s sizes, this is a ‘roadie fit,’ so expect it to be more on the fitted side. If you want to layer underneath it, consider sizing up—but don’t worry, the fabric is quite stretchy.</p><ul><li>Material details: GORE-TEX INFINIUM WindStopper</li><li>Available in: Men, Women</li><li>Sizes: Men—S – 3XL / Women—XS – XL</li><li>Colors: Men—Black, orange, military green, red / Women—Navy, black, light blue, orange</li><li>MSRP: $370</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Great roadie slim fit, but still stretchy enough to accommodate layers and snacks<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Pricey<br></p><h3><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=0ce15e77-676b-474a-a764-ec31b4d41757&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decathlon.com%2Fcollections%2Fbike-jackets%2Fproducts%2Ftriban-rc100-high-visibility-winter-cycling-jacket-mens%3F&amp;ctc=xid:fr1636429350223deh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-orig-url=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=0ce15e77-676b-474a-a764-ec31b4d41757&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decathlon.com%2Fcollections%2Fbike-jackets%2Fproducts%2Ftriban-rc100-high-visibility-winter-cycling-jacket-mens%3F\" data-ml-id=\"10\" data-ml=\"true\" data-xid=\"fr1636429350223deh\"><span>&nbsp;Decathlon Triban RC100 High Visibility Winter Cycling Jacket&nbsp;</span></a></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175435/decathlon-Triban-RC100-winter-cycling-jacket.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175435/decathlon-Triban-RC100-winter-cycling-jacket.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175435/decathlon-Triban-RC100-winter-cycling-jacket.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175435/decathlon-Triban-RC100-winter-cycling-jacket-297x149.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175435/decathlon-Triban-RC100-winter-cycling-jacket-800x400.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175435/decathlon-Triban-RC100-winter-cycling-jacket-120x60.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175435/decathlon-Triban-RC100-winter-cycling-jacket-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p>We love a jacket that looks and feels much pricier than it is, and at $60, holy moly is this jacket a bargain.

And we love the paneling, which improves fit for cyclists, as well as the two-way zip for bonus ventilation. <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/03/26/albion-ultralight-insulated-jacket-from-99g-packs-warmth-in-breathable-recycled-fabrics/\">(Read more about it here.)</a></p><ul><li>Material details: Clo’s Eco Vivo breathable recycled insulation and 100% recycled nylon ultralight ripstop face fabric with a C0 DWR coating</li><li>Available in: Men</li><li>Sizes: XS-3XL</li><li>Colors: Yellow, light green</li><li>MSRP: $228</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Ultra-light, packable<br><strong>CONS</strong>: No women’s option, limited colors<br></p><h3><a href=\"https://velocio.cc/products/mens-recon-snap-jacket\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span>&nbsp;Velocio Recon Snap Jacket&nbsp;</span></a></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175430/velocio-snap-recon-winter-cycling-jacket.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175430/velocio-snap-recon-winter-cycling-jacket.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175430/velocio-snap-recon-winter-cycling-jacket.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175430/velocio-snap-recon-winter-cycling-jacket-297x149.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175430/velocio-snap-recon-winter-cycling-jacket-800x400.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175430/velocio-snap-recon-winter-cycling-jacket-120x60.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175430/velocio-snap-recon-winter-cycling-jacket-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p>If you’re looking for an option that feels technical but looks utterly casual, <a href=\"https://velocio.cc/products/mens-recon-snap-jacket\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Velocio’s Snap Recon Jacket</a> has you covered. Available in men’s and women’s sizing, this jacket looks quilted on the front, but has stretchy paneling that makes it ideal for shredding on the trails and moving your body.</p><p>The Pertex Quantum Air shell with DWR treatment ensures that it’s water resistant and windproof, while Polartec on the inside keeps you cozy. We appreciate the slight roominess in the jacket, as well as the front pockets and chest pocket for stashing important gear.</p><p>Unlike the more road-oriented jackets, this one doesn’t have back pockets, but for trail riding, most people would opt for a hydration pack anyway. And don’t worry, the snaps are hearty enough to stay in place no matter how hard you send it. (There’s also a Recon vest option from Velocio that we love for riding during the shoulder seasons, running, or just plain running errands.)</p><ul><li>Material details: Pertex Quantum, Polartec Alpha Direct insulation, DWR treated</li><li>Available in: Men, Women</li><li>Sizes: Men—XS – 3XL / Women—XXS – XXL</li><li>Colors: Black, navy, olive</li><li>MSRP: $289</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Comfortable and looks good enough to wear anywhere<br><strong>CONS</strong>: No back pockets<br></p><h3><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FEndura-MT500-Freezing-Point-Jacket-II-11&amp;ctc=xid:fr1636429350223jdi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-orig-url=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FEndura-MT500-Freezing-Point-Jacket-II-11\" data-ml-id=\"12\" data-ml=\"true\" data-xid=\"fr1636429350223jdi\"><span>&nbsp;Endura US MT500 Freezing Point Jacket II&nbsp;</span></a></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175415/endura-mt-500-winter-cycling-jacket.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175415/endura-mt-500-winter-cycling-jacket.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175415/endura-mt-500-winter-cycling-jacket.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175415/endura-mt-500-winter-cycling-jacket-297x149.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175415/endura-mt-500-winter-cycling-jacket-800x400.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175415/endura-mt-500-winter-cycling-jacket-120x60.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175415/endura-mt-500-winter-cycling-jacket-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a><br>The Endura US <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FEndura-MT500-Freezing-Point-Jacket-II-11&amp;ctc=xid:fr1636429350223agb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-orig-url=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FEndura-MT500-Freezing-Point-Jacket-II-11\" data-ml-id=\"13\" data-ml=\"true\" data-xid=\"fr1636429350223agb\">MT500 Freezing Point Jacket II</a> immediately impressed us with how super comfy it is. The softshell feel makes it great for MTB and casual gravel rides since it’s not skintight, which means there’s huge range of motion for arm movement, but it is treated with an eco-friendly DWR so it’s water-resistant.</p><p>We also love that unlike many winter coats, this one added zippers in the underarm area for bonus ventilation, making it a jacket that can carry you into fall and spring riding in addition to most winter temps. It boasts a hood, which may be better for mountain bikers in the winter – we advise against hoods for road riding since they can block your peripheral vision and in the winter, you want all the visibility you can get, but on trail, hoods are just plain cozy. (Note: Normally our 6’2″ tall-but-slim Bikerumor editor wears an XL on anything long sleeve, but this Large fits great, with sleeve length to spare.)</p><ul><li>Material details: PrimaLoft® Gold Active insulation and fabric, DWR coating</li><li>Available in: Men</li><li>Sizes: XS – XXL</li><li>Colors: Black</li><li>MSRP: $200</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Great price, super comfy, very warm<br><strong>CONS</strong>: One color + men’s only<br></p><h2>Best Winter Commuter Cycling Jackets</h2><h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-orig-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/?tag=20br-20\" data-ml-id=\"16\" data-ml=\"true\" data-xid=\"fr1636429350223bfg\"><span>&nbsp;Proviz Reflect 360 CRS+&nbsp;</span></a></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175422/provis-crs-winter-cycling-jacket.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175422/provis-crs-winter-cycling-jacket.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175422/provis-crs-winter-cycling-jacket.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175422/provis-crs-winter-cycling-jacket-297x149.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175422/provis-crs-winter-cycling-jacket-800x400.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175422/provis-crs-winter-cycling-jacket-120x60.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26175422/provis-crs-winter-cycling-jacket-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p>The Proviz Reflect 360 has a looser cut, making it a super comfortable commuter jacket that’s easy to layer over whatever normal clothes you’re wearing underneath.

It’s ultra-light and ready for riding, and when Rapha says ‘explore,’ they mean it: It’s designed to be comfy enough to sleep in, so bikepackers can either lighten their load by opting for a lighter sleeping bag, or stay warm even when camping in freezing conditions with a zero-rated bag.</p><p>It packs down into a tiny bag, making it the ultimate bikepacker clothing choice. And even the responsibly sourced down feathers are treated with an eco-friendly DWR, so you won’t end up with the terrible feeling of ultra-soggy down stuffing if you get caught in the rain. Cinches and elastic at the cuffs, neck and waistband trap warm air inside, and there are small reflective accents on the front and back. Hood is removable, too.</p><ul><li>Material details: Main: 100% Polyester; Insulation: 90% Goose Down (treated with 100% fluorocarbon-free water-repellent treatment)</li><li>Available in: Men, Women</li><li>Sizes: Men—XS – XL / Women—XXS – XL</li><li>Colors: Men—Navy, black, orange, olive, gold / Women—Pale purple, navy</li><li>MSRP: $295</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Looks fantastic, great for bikepacking<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Only the two hand warmer pockets<br></p><div id=\"attachment_267361\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/04092205/All-new-Festka-Scout-custom-carbon-gravel-bike_adventure-bikepacking-gravel-bikes_winter-riding-r.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-267361\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/04092205/All-new-Festka-Scout-custom-carbon-gravel-bike_adventure-bikepacking-gravel-bikes_winter-riding-r.jpg\" alt=\"All-new Festka Scout custom carbon gravel bike, adventure bikepacking gravel bikes,&nbsp;winter test riding\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/04092205/All-new-Festka-Scout-custom-carbon-gravel-bike_adventure-bikepacking-gravel-bikes_winter-riding-r.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/04092205/All-new-Festka-Scout-custom-carbon-gravel-bike_adventure-bikepacking-gravel-bikes_winter-riding-r-297x167.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/04092205/All-new-Festka-Scout-custom-carbon-gravel-bike_adventure-bikepacking-gravel-bikes_winter-riding-r-800x450.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/04092205/All-new-Festka-Scout-custom-carbon-gravel-bike_adventure-bikepacking-gravel-bikes_winter-riding-r-120x68.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/04092205/All-new-Festka-Scout-custom-carbon-gravel-bike_adventure-bikepacking-gravel-bikes_winter-riding-r-768x432.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/04092205/All-new-Festka-Scout-custom-carbon-gravel-bike_adventure-bikepacking-gravel-bikes_winter-riding-r-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/04092205/All-new-Festka-Scout-custom-carbon-gravel-bike_adventure-bikepacking-gravel-bikes_winter-riding-r-696x392.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/04092205/All-new-Festka-Scout-custom-carbon-gravel-bike_adventure-bikepacking-gravel-bikes_winter-riding-r-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/04092205/All-new-Festka-Scout-custom-carbon-gravel-bike_adventure-bikepacking-gravel-bikes_winter-riding-r-747x420.jpg 747w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-267361\">c. Festka</p></div><h2>Buyer’s Guide for Winter Cycling Jackets</h2><p><strong>Type of riding you do in winter.<br></strong>Start with the basics: Are you typically riding on the road? If so, a jacket that’s more fitted and jersey-like will be your best defense against winter weather while still being aerodynamic. Mountain bikers may like road-style jackets, but many prefer a jacket with some insulation since mountain biking tends to have more stops and starts, and staying warm can be trickier. And for commuters, a jacket that’s high-vis is a great idea, though you may also prefer something that’s a bit more aesthetically-oriented, something that you can wear around town as well as on your bike.</p><p><strong>Type of winter weather you have.<br></strong>What are your winter conditions you ride in? Is it wet, cold, lots of snow, short season, long season, et cetera? If you have a lot more rainy days where temps hover over 40F, you may not need a winter coat: A raincoat might be more important for your cycling wardrobe. Or at the least, looking for a winter coat that’s water-resistant or waterproof will be key.</p><p><strong>Sizing.<br></strong>Check size charts carefully before purchasing, since winter cycling coats may not fit the same way that other pieces from the brand do. For instance, Rapha’s cycling jackets are designed to be slightly loose to allow for clothing underneath, so if you tend to be between sizes, you can likely size down. But read the sizing charts and actually take your own measurements before purchasing, and if in doubt, reach out to the company to ask for advice, or order two size options and return the one that doesn’t fit.</p><p><strong>Material and lining</strong>.<br>There are obviously a wide range of materials that can be used for winter cycling jackets, but it’s worth checking the label and looking for quality materials. Ideally, there will be some kind of (preferably eco-friendly) water-proofing, some type of liner fabric, and some kind of shell fabric on the outside. Use of GORE or Polartec is a good indication that your jacket has high quality components. And if your jacket does contain down, it’s important to check that there’s some kind of waterproofing of the liner or the feathers themselves. Soggy down is not a good thing!</p><p><strong>Waterproofing</strong>.<br>Again, how wet is it in your area? Many places in the US end up being soggy rather than snowy, making an&nbsp; environmentally sensitive DWR (durable water repellent) coating important.</p><div id=\"attachment_205489\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/endura-mt500-mountain-biking-downhill-enduro-winter-riding-kit.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-205489\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/endura-mt500-mountain-biking-downhill-enduro-winter-riding-kit.jpg\" alt=\"waterproof mtb riding kit endura mt500\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/endura-mt500-mountain-biking-downhill-enduro-winter-riding-kit.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/endura-mt500-mountain-biking-downhill-enduro-winter-riding-kit-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/endura-mt500-mountain-biking-downhill-enduro-winter-riding-kit-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/endura-mt500-mountain-biking-downhill-enduro-winter-riding-kit-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/endura-mt500-mountain-biking-downhill-enduro-winter-riding-kit-600x400.jpg 600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/endura-mt500-mountain-biking-downhill-enduro-winter-riding-kit-696x464.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/endura-mt500-mountain-biking-downhill-enduro-winter-riding-kit-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/endura-mt500-mountain-biking-downhill-enduro-winter-riding-kit-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-205489\">Waterproofing on the Endura MT500. c. Endura</p></div><p><strong>Pockets</strong>.<br>Having at least some kind of pocket on the jacket is important, particularly if you’re riding on the road. We prefer jackets for the road that have pockets similar to a standard jersey, so that you can easily access them without stopping. For MTB or commuting, it’s less critical, but having at least one pocket to keep your valuables or an easy-access snack is important. Hand warmer pockets are basically essential on all but road-cycling jackets.</p><p><strong>Vents and zippers</strong>.<br>We love coats with options to vent and to zip from the top and bottom to add airflow and access pockets underneath. We also only selected jackets for this list that had zippers that are built to last, with waterproofing, zipper garages to protect them and your skin, and solid construction. We also prefer offset zippers on cycling jackets, particularly if you plan to wear a jersey with a zipper underneath them—otherwise, you have two zips bumping each other, which can cause neck irritation. (A good zipper ‘garage’ at the top of the zip helps to alleviate that issue as well.)</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19102810/ConsumateAthleteWinter2021jodydwilson-8334-winter-cycling-caps.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19102810/ConsumateAthleteWinter2021jodydwilson-8334-winter-cycling-caps.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1066\" height=\"1600\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19102810/ConsumateAthleteWinter2021jodydwilson-8334-winter-cycling-caps.jpg 1066w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19102810/ConsumateAthleteWinter2021jodydwilson-8334-winter-cycling-caps-200x300.jpg 200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19102810/ConsumateAthleteWinter2021jodydwilson-8334-winter-cycling-caps-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19102810/ConsumateAthleteWinter2021jodydwilson-8334-winter-cycling-caps-80x120.jpg 80w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19102810/ConsumateAthleteWinter2021jodydwilson-8334-winter-cycling-caps-768x1153.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19102810/ConsumateAthleteWinter2021jodydwilson-8334-winter-cycling-caps-1023x1536.jpg 1023w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1066px) 100vw, 1066px\"></a></p><p><strong>Hood or no hood.<br></strong>We’ll get into this later in the FAQ section below, but hoods are generally not a make-or-break part of a winter cycling jacket. In fact, the debate over a hood is often only relevant if you plan to use the coat beyond just on the bike. Putting a beanie or balaclava under your helmet is usually a better option.</p><p><strong>Price</strong>.<br>If you don’t ride outside often in the winter, you may not want to splurge on a winter cycling jacket—a budget friendly option like Pactimo or even Decathlon may better fit your needs, or you may want to just add layers under a raincoat. But a good cycling jacket will last for years, and most brands have long warranty periods. Many of our favorite jackets are also easily usable as running, XC skiing, or even just casual wear jackets as well, so if you’re on the fence about spending the money, consider choosing a coat that will work in other areas of your life as well.</p><div id=\"attachment_253870\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26141639/Albion-Ultralight-Insulated-Jacket_ultra-lightweight-packable-breathable-eco-cycling-jacket-and-backpack_riding.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-253870\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26141639/Albion-Ultralight-Insulated-Jacket_ultra-lightweight-packable-breathable-eco-cycling-jacket-and-backpack_riding.jpg\" alt=\"Albion Ultralight Insulated Jacket, ultra lightweight packable breathable eco cycling jacket and backpack,&nbsp;riding\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26141639/Albion-Ultralight-Insulated-Jacket_ultra-lightweight-packable-breathable-eco-cycling-jacket-and-backpack_riding.jpg 1500w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26141639/Albion-Ultralight-Insulated-Jacket_ultra-lightweight-packable-breathable-eco-cycling-jacket-and-backpack_riding-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26141639/Albion-Ultralight-Insulated-Jacket_ultra-lightweight-packable-breathable-eco-cycling-jacket-and-backpack_riding-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26141639/Albion-Ultralight-Insulated-Jacket_ultra-lightweight-packable-breathable-eco-cycling-jacket-and-backpack_riding-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26141639/Albion-Ultralight-Insulated-Jacket_ultra-lightweight-packable-breathable-eco-cycling-jacket-and-backpack_riding-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26141639/Albion-Ultralight-Insulated-Jacket_ultra-lightweight-packable-breathable-eco-cycling-jacket-and-backpack_riding-696x464.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26141639/Albion-Ultralight-Insulated-Jacket_ultra-lightweight-packable-breathable-eco-cycling-jacket-and-backpack_riding-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26141639/Albion-Ultralight-Insulated-Jacket_ultra-lightweight-packable-breathable-eco-cycling-jacket-and-backpack_riding-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-253870\">Albion Ultralight Insulated Jacket, ultra lightweight packable breathable eco cycling jacket. c. Albion</p></div><h2>Frequently Asked Questions about Winter Cycling Jackets</h2><p><strong>Do I need a winter cycling jacket?</strong><br>It depends on how much you ride in the winter. While they’re great and allow riders to shed some layers while still staying cozy, if you only ride a few times in the winter, you can likely get away with wearing a baselayer, long sleeve or thermal jersey, and a rain jacket in order to stay fairly warm. And if you’re not planning on doing a serious ride—think commute to work or errands by bike—a regular puffy coat should do the trick.</p><p><strong>What should I wear under a winter cycling jacket?</strong><br>We love a merino wool baselayer for sweat-wicking that doesn’t stink. Opting for a long sleeve baselayer is great if it’s super cold and you want to layer another jersey over it before putting on your jacket, or in more mild conditions, it can be worn on its own under the jacket.</p><p>If you don’t have a good long sleeve baselayer, a sleeveless baselayer and a long sleeve jersey is a great option. Make sure that whatever you are wearing under your baselayer still offers room to move around and breathe comfortably: Some people opt for too many layers and actually end up losing circulation in their hands because the jacket and clothes underneath are so tight.</p><div id=\"attachment_74600\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Wool-X-womens-midweight-longsleeve-wool-baselayer02.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74600\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Wool-X-womens-midweight-longsleeve-wool-baselayer02.jpg\" alt=\"Wool-X-womens-midweight-longsleeve-wool-baselayer-review\" width=\"888\" height=\"661\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Wool-X-womens-midweight-longsleeve-wool-baselayer02.jpg 888w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Wool-X-womens-midweight-longsleeve-wool-baselayer02-120x89.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Wool-X-womens-midweight-longsleeve-wool-baselayer02-297x221.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Wool-X-womens-midweight-longsleeve-wool-baselayer02-600x446.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-74600\">A long sleeve baselayer from Wool-X</p></div><p><strong>What’s with men’s versus women’s sizing being weird?</strong><br>This is actually a question we’re often asking around the Bikerumor Slack channels. You may have noticed something strange when reading the sizes available in these coats (and other cycling kit). The size ranges tend to not be identical, though the same number of sizes are offered in many cases.</p><p>The men’s will read XS-2XL, while the women’s options run from XXS-XL. Strange? Yes. Sometimes, it’s even stranger, with women’s sizes being shown in numerical sizing while men’s are in Small, Medium, etc. We don’t really have a great answer—other than to blame the fashion industry—but we do want to use this as a reminder to check size charts carefully before purchasing!</p><p>Many companies have online chat features on their sites, so if you’re confused about sizing, hop on and ask them… And maybe mention the sizing discrepancies between men’s and women’s while you’re in the chat. And if you can do so, we even suggest ordering two sizes so you can try them on to find the best fit and return the other if you’re not sure of which size to get.</p><div id=\"attachment_276424\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27095216/robert-ruggiero-BXUhTnhUI1I-unsplash.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-276424\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27095216/robert-ruggiero-BXUhTnhUI1I-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1291\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27095216/robert-ruggiero-BXUhTnhUI1I-unsplash.jpg 1920w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27095216/robert-ruggiero-BXUhTnhUI1I-unsplash-297x200.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27095216/robert-ruggiero-BXUhTnhUI1I-unsplash-800x538.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27095216/robert-ruggiero-BXUhTnhUI1I-unsplash-120x81.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27095216/robert-ruggiero-BXUhTnhUI1I-unsplash-768x516.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27095216/robert-ruggiero-BXUhTnhUI1I-unsplash-1536x1033.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-276424\">c. Robert Ruggiero on Unsplash</p></div><p><strong>Why can’t I just wear my down jacket to ride?</strong><br>We don’t love a regular puffy coat for any rides that might get sweaty for a few reasons. First, most of the time, a puffy coat is overkill, unless you’re fat biking in sub zero temperatures. You’ll actually end up chillier because you’ll quickly work up a sweat, then if you do need to stop or slow down, you’ll be wet from the sweat and cool quickly. Puffy coats also are generally not designed to be washed often, and if you’re sweating in it constantly, that’s just not a great situation.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19101556/winter-cycling-caps.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19101556/winter-cycling-caps.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1616\" height=\"922\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19101556/winter-cycling-caps.jpg 1616w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19101556/winter-cycling-caps-297x169.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19101556/winter-cycling-caps-800x456.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19101556/winter-cycling-caps-120x68.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19101556/winter-cycling-caps-768x438.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19101556/winter-cycling-caps-1536x876.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1616px) 100vw, 1616px\"></a></p><p><strong>What other winter riding gear do I need?</strong><br>Think about being covered from head to toe. If you live in truly chilly conditions, we’d suggest:</p><ul><li>Helmet cover</li><li>Balaclava or combination of buff and winter cap</li><li>Winter jacket</li><li>Long sleeve jersey and/or Long sleeve baselayer</li><li>Winter gloves</li><li>Thermal tights (or thermal shorts/regular shorts with thermal legwarmers)</li><li>Wool socks</li><li>Shoe covers</li></ul><p>The warmer your winter, the less clothing you need to add. You may be able to skip a top layer, opting for just a softshell jacket and a merino wool baselayer, or choose regular tights over a thermal option.</p><p><strong>Do I need a hood?</strong><br>In the winter, we actually prefer to ride without a hood up for better visibility and peripheral vision. Some jackets will have hoods attached, but those tend to be jackets that are designed to go from riding to walking or running. You’re better served keeping your head cozy with a thin merino wool cap and a buff, or a balaclava under your helmet.</p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Molly Hurford","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"55af73a24edd30135508132c9fae847ab34359587afe00d19e65d92963964188","category":"Cycling"}
