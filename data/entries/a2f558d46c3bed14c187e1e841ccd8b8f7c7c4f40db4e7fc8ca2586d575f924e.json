However, three and a half years and two AirPods Pro updates later, the 1st gen AirPods Max are still on shelves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a new report claims a new AirPods Max model is finally on the way in 2024. According to Jeff Hu of Haitong International Securities (via <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/01/lower-cost-airpods-late-2024-rumor/&amp;xcust=1-1-2285151-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Macrumors</a>), the 2nd-gen AirPods Max is expected to arrive in the fourth quarter of 2024, which likely means it’ll get an update alongside the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16</a>. While Pu doesn’t outline any of the new features, previous rumors said the new models will dump the Lightning port for USB-C, and pick up some of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233522/airpods-pro-review.html#:~:text=The%20real%20genius%20of%20the,have%20them%20in%20at%20all.\">AirPods Pro</a> features like the H2 chip and Lossless Audio when used with Vision Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also expected, according to Pu, is a low-end model to replace the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232610/airpods-2nd-generation-review.html\">2nd-gen AirPods</a> that have been on sale since 2019. Apple lowered the price to $129 in 2021 when the 3rd-gen model arrived but hasn’t updated it since. Rumors say this new model will be very similar to the current 2nd-gen model but with an updated design and $99 price tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new lower-cost AirPods have been dubbed AirPods Lite by some leaks, though AirPods SE would make more sense with Apple’s other product lines.
