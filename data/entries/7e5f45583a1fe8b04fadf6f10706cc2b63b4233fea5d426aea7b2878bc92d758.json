The new eMTB is of course based on the Blizzard Hardtail, a Fat Bike that has graced the Bikes.com lineup for many years; this is the very first eBike version thereof.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of any amount of motor-assistance for Fat Biking in deepest winter is an attractive one. If the assistance of the motor can help out the rider enough to prevent them from sweating, then that rider stands benefit, staying warmer for longer. Prospective customers may well have concerns around the performance of any motor or battery in very cold conditions, but Rocky Mountain say they have tested the Dyname 4.0 motor in extreme weather conditions – with much success. And, the 720 Wh battery tucked inside this 7005 aluminum frame will function at temperatures as low as -20°C (-4°F).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rocky Mountain says the Blizzard PowerPlay delivers a powerful ride without getting bogged down in deep snow, with unparalleled range. Without further ado, let’s check out the details.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rocky-mountain-blizzard-powerplay-fat-emtb-dyname-motor.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rocky-mountain-blizzard-powerplay-fat-emtb-dyname-motor-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"rocky mountain blizzard powerplay fatebike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rocky-mountain-blizzard-powerplay-fat-emtb-dyname-motor-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rocky-mountain-blizzard-powerplay-fat-emtb-dyname-motor-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rocky-mountain-blizzard-powerplay-fat-emtb-dyname-motor-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rocky-mountain-blizzard-powerplay-fat-emtb-dyname-motor-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rocky-mountain-blizzard-powerplay-fat-emtb-dyname-motor-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rocky-mountain-blizzard-powerplay-fat-emtb-dyname-motor-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rocky-mountain-blizzard-powerplay-fat-emtb-dyname-motor.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rocky Mountain Blizzard PowerPlay Fat eBike</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bike: Rocky Mountain Blizzard PowerPlay</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Intention: Riding anywhere, but especially suited to snowy, sandy or gravel </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Motor: Dyname 4.0</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Battery Capacity: 720 Wh</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Range Extender Capacity: 314 Wh Overtime Pack</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sizing: SM, MD, LG, XL</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Starting Price:</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While the acoustic <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rocky-mountain-blizzard-grows-with-27-5-wheels-longer-slacker-fat-bike-geometry/\" target=\"_blank\">Blizzard Fat Bike</a> is a full carbon affair, the Blizzard PowerPlay Fat-E is available only in alloy, running a 7005 aluminum tubeset.

The rear-center length is 5mm longer at 460mm, with seat tube lengths equivalent, starting at 380mm on the SM, and topping out at 490mm on the XL.

Below that threshold, the battery will shut itself down to protect itself. When its temperature rises again to -15°C, it will function once more. Even in such chilly conditions, RMB says the battery still delivers around 85% of its full capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 2 Amp and 4 Amp charger are available to charge the battery off the bike. The former takes a claimed 7 hours and 35 minutes to restore a full charge, while the latter takes a claimed 3 hours and 55 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rocky-mountain-blizzard-powerplay-dyname-motor-jumbatron-display-top-tube.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rocky-mountain-blizzard-powerplay-dyname-motor-jumbatron-display-top-tube-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rocky-mountain-blizzard-powerplay-dyname-motor-jumbatron-display-top-tube-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rocky-mountain-blizzard-powerplay-dyname-motor-jumbatron-display-top-tube-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rocky-mountain-blizzard-powerplay-dyname-motor-jumbatron-display-top-tube-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rocky-mountain-blizzard-powerplay-dyname-motor-jumbatron-display-top-tube-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rocky-mountain-blizzard-powerplay-dyname-motor-jumbatron-display-top-tube-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rocky-mountain-blizzard-powerplay-dyname-motor-jumbatron-display-top-tube-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rocky-mountain-blizzard-powerplay-dyname-motor-jumbatron-display-top-tube.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rocky Mountain communicate the battery’s charge status, and the system’s riding mode on their so-called Jumbotron display.
