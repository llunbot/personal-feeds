Updates to the Intel version of the Framework Laptop have boosted CPU performance, but its graphics performance has been at a standstill since the Framework Laptop <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/frameworks-new-lightweight-modular-laptop-delivers-on-its-promises/\">originally hit the scene</a> in mid-2021.</p>\n<p>Even AMD's latest integrated graphics won't make a thin-and-light laptop a replacement for a gaming PC with dedicated graphics, but a bit more GPU power makes the Framework Laptop that much more versatile, making it easier to play games at reasonable resolutions and settings than it is on Intel's aging Iris Xe graphics hardware.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970645#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970645&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6c147b6e1a0d1d62205f3d06361f56ecab116e6b0f1fb29024f9b3aab7ee5941","category":"Tech"}
