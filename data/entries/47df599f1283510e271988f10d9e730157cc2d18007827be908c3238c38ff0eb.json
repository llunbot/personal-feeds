These diseases are one of the top 10 leading causes of death for women under 65, and cases are increasing annually worldwide. There is evidence suggesting that it's femalesâ€™ double complement of X chromosomes that puts them at such heightened risk for autoimmune diseases. Female cells have two X chromosomes, whereas males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (at least in mammals).</p>\n<h2>Shutting down an X</h2>\n<p>Different animals compensate for this sort of disparity in different ways. Male fly cells churn out twice the amount of the proteins encoded by their single X chromosome, so they end up with the same amount as female cells. Worm hermaphrodite cells reduce production of the proteins encoded by each of their X chromosomes by half, so they end up with the same amount as male cells.</p>\n<p>Mammals use X inactivation, in which each female cell shuts off one of its X chromosomes and only uses the other. Which X chromosome is shut off (the paternally inherited one or the maternally inherited one) is random and independent within each cell. So women are all genetic mosaics: Their cells are not all making the same proteins since some of their cells use one of their X chromosomes and some of their cells use the other.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001339#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001339&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Diana Gitig","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"47df599f1283510e271988f10d9e730157cc2d18007827be908c3238c38ff0eb","category":"Tech"}
