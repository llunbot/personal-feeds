With iOS 17 and iPadOS 17, that finally changes. Here’s how to enable or disable Crossfade and adjust the length of the transition.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><div><div>At a glance </div></div><ul><li><span>Time to complete: </span><span>1 minute</span></li><li>Tools required: none</li><li>Materials required: iPhone with iOS 17</li><li>Cost: 0</li></ul></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>Open Settings and select <em>Music</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ios17-music-crossfade-01.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iOS 17 Apple Music Crossfade\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Most of the settings for Apple Music are found in Settings, not the Music app. First, open Settings.
