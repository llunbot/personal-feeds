At the Gates Carbon Drive booth, we set eyes on what has to be one of our show highlights; a Crossworx Trip 290 eMTB with the new 55 Nm <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bosch-performance-line-sx-ebike-motor/\" target=\"_blank\">Bosch Performance Line SX motor</a>, and a Gates Carbon Drive combined with the Classified Powershift Hub.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-enduro-emtb-bosch-cx-motor-classified-powershift-2-speed-belt-drive.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-enduro-emtb-bosch-cx-motor-classified-powershift-2-speed-belt-drive-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"crossworx trip290 emtb bosch sx gates carbondrive classified powershift hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-enduro-emtb-bosch-cx-motor-classified-powershift-2-speed-belt-drive-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-enduro-emtb-bosch-cx-motor-classified-powershift-2-speed-belt-drive-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-enduro-emtb-bosch-cx-motor-classified-powershift-2-speed-belt-drive-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-enduro-emtb-bosch-cx-motor-classified-powershift-2-speed-belt-drive-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-enduro-emtb-bosch-cx-motor-classified-powershift-2-speed-belt-drive-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-enduro-emtb-bosch-cx-motor-classified-powershift-2-speed-belt-drive-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-enduro-emtb-bosch-cx-motor-classified-powershift-2-speed-belt-drive.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>As seen here, the Crossworx’ prototype Trip 290 eMTB – with Bosch SX Motor, 400 Wh CompactTube Battery, Gates Carbon Drive and Classified Powershift Hub – weighs a claimed 20.2 kg</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Crossworx Trip 290 Prototype eMTB</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re looking at a prototype here, rolling on 29″ wheels with a CompactTube 400 Wh battery inside the downtube and 140mm of rear wheel travel.

What looks to be a single-speed eBike is in fact a two-speed eBike, thanks to the internally geared hub that we have recently seen <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/classified-powershift-2x-internal-gear-mtb-hub-for-shimano-sram-12-speed/\" target=\"_blank\">bring 2x drivetrains back into the world of mountain biking</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-trip290-emtb-gates-carbon-drive-classified-powershift-hub-dropout-details.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-trip290-emtb-gates-carbon-drive-classified-powershift-hub-dropout-details-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"crossworx prototype emtb classified gates carbon drive bosch sx motor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-trip290-emtb-gates-carbon-drive-classified-powershift-hub-dropout-details-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-trip290-emtb-gates-carbon-drive-classified-powershift-hub-dropout-details-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-trip290-emtb-gates-carbon-drive-classified-powershift-hub-dropout-details-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-trip290-emtb-gates-carbon-drive-classified-powershift-hub-dropout-details-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-trip290-emtb-gates-carbon-drive-classified-powershift-hub-dropout-details-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-trip290-emtb-gates-carbon-drive-classified-powershift-hub-dropout-details-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-trip290-emtb-gates-carbon-drive-classified-powershift-hub-dropout-details.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-emtb-gates-belt-drive-classified-pwershift-hub.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-emtb-gates-belt-drive-classified-pwershift-hub-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"classified powershift hub with gates carbon drive emtb full suspension crossworx trip290\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-emtb-gates-belt-drive-classified-pwershift-hub-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-emtb-gates-belt-drive-classified-pwershift-hub-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-emtb-gates-belt-drive-classified-pwershift-hub-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-emtb-gates-belt-drive-classified-pwershift-hub-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-emtb-gates-belt-drive-classified-pwershift-hub-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-emtb-gates-belt-drive-classified-pwershift-hub-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-emtb-gates-belt-drive-classified-pwershift-hub.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A 48T chainring is paired with a 24T cog on the hub to give a gear 2:1 ratio. But, the Classified Powershift Hub can deliver a second gear ratio of 1:0.7, giving an effective chainring size of 24T. So, you have two gear options with no derailleur on the front or the rear. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-trip290-emtb-linkage-closeup-gates-carbon-drive-classified-powershift.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-trip290-emtb-linkage-closeup-gates-carbon-drive-classified-powershift-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"crossworx trip290 prototype emtb 140mm travel linkage driven single pivot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-trip290-emtb-linkage-closeup-gates-carbon-drive-classified-powershift-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-trip290-emtb-linkage-closeup-gates-carbon-drive-classified-powershift-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-trip290-emtb-linkage-closeup-gates-carbon-drive-classified-powershift-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-trip290-emtb-linkage-closeup-gates-carbon-drive-classified-powershift-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-trip290-emtb-linkage-closeup-gates-carbon-drive-classified-powershift-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-trip290-emtb-linkage-closeup-gates-carbon-drive-classified-powershift-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/crossworx-trip290-emtb-linkage-closeup-gates-carbon-drive-classified-powershift.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From a geometry standpoint, the Crossworx Trip 290 is most similar to the Lite 290, but with a slacker 65° head tube angle and 10mm more rear wheel travel. For reference, it has a reach of around 475mm in large with a 447mm chainstay length.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As it is still under development, Crossworx won’t be ready to take orders for the Trip 290 eMTB until autumn or winter of this year. It’s too early to give mention of any pricing, but we are told the Trip 290 will be offered across four frame sizes We’ll bring you guys more information on this new eBike as soon as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.crossworx-cycles.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">crossworx-cycles.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/crossworx-trip-290-ebike-gates-carbon-drive-classified-powershift-bosch-sx/\">Crossworx Trip 290 eBike Goes Gates Carbon Drive x Classified Powershift x Bosch SX</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jessie-May Morgan","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"5e4fb6591cfc1bbb0e7e0c16cd4ac9d54c32b2c4b32d0f881cebd5093ff2fca5","category":"Cycling"}
