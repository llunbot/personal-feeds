It’s a no-nonsense 29er trail bike with (<em>a bit confusingly</em>) 130mm of travel front and rear, and complete bike prices from as little as 2280€. I had the chance to ride the new bike over the course of five tough days in the UK at an excellent enduro racing event that pushed the bike to its limits, and maybe a bit beyond. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s clearly a bike that can handle everything from your local singletrack loops to a full-on underbiking on technical enduro track.

Bikerumor</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Merida’s One-Twenty keeps its category-defining middle-of-the-road name, 5 generations in – even if it has grown in capabilities and travel over the last 15 years. To Merida, One-Twenty means that space between XC &amp; Enduro racing – a sweet spot for the trail riding most typical mountain bikers actually ride. If you aren’t racing XC you probably don’t need a weight-weenie cross-county bike. And if you aren’t really racing for the enduro podium, pedaling around on a long-travel gravity-inspired machine is also overkill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern capable geometry and 130mm of travel from a 29er will get you everything in between. And to be honest, you could probably dabble in a bit of racing on either XC or EN extreme if you want to push the boundaries. I certainly did, and came away with a smile on my muddy face.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>My thoughts on the new 2024 One-Twenty</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_Exmoor-NP-trail-riding.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_Exmoor-NP-trail-riding.jpg\" alt=\"Merida One-Twenty Review, affordable 130mm alloy trail mountain bike, riding Exmoor national park\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_Exmoor-NP-trail-riding.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_Exmoor-NP-trail-riding-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_Exmoor-NP-trail-riding-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_Exmoor-NP-trail-riding-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_Exmoor-NP-trail-riding-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_Exmoor-NP-trail-riding-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption><em>photo by Cory Benson, c.

And the new horizontal shock position makes room for 2 water bottles and a mini tool strap, together a great boost for all-day epic rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my mind, the internal cable routing through the headset is a wash. Sure it makes for a ‘cleaner-looking’ cockpit, but it’ll cost you more to replace that headset down the road in a few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_Merida-aluminum-prototype-test-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_Merida-aluminum-prototype-test-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Merida One-Twenty Review, affordable 130mm alloy trail mountain bike, Merida aluminum prototype bike testing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_Merida-aluminum-prototype-test-bike.jpg 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_Merida-aluminum-prototype-test-bike-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_Merida-aluminum-prototype-test-bike-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_Merida-aluminum-prototype-test-bike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_Merida-aluminum-prototype-test-bike-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_Merida-aluminum-prototype-test-bike-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>c.

What this new one saves in simplicity, it pretty much adds back in beefier, more capable components. A solid move in my mind. But, in the past there had been a 12.8kg carbon version. That lighter option was a lot more expensive, but now you don’t get the choice, even if you have the budget. That certainly makes this a more accessible bike to the masses, but it will never be a trail bike for weight weenies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2024 Merida One-Twenty 700: First Rides</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty_affordable-130mm-aluminum-alloy-Lite-trail-mountain-bike_photo-by-Paul-Box.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty_affordable-130mm-aluminum-alloy-Lite-trail-mountain-bike_photo-by-Paul-Box.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Merida One-Twenty, affordable 130mm aluminum alloy Lite trail mountain bike, Cory riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty_affordable-130mm-aluminum-alloy-Lite-trail-mountain-bike_photo-by-Paul-Box.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty_affordable-130mm-aluminum-alloy-Lite-trail-mountain-bike_photo-by-Paul-Box-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty_affordable-130mm-aluminum-alloy-Lite-trail-mountain-bike_photo-by-Paul-Box-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty_affordable-130mm-aluminum-alloy-Lite-trail-mountain-bike_photo-by-Paul-Box-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty_affordable-130mm-aluminum-alloy-Lite-trail-mountain-bike_photo-by-Paul-Box-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty_affordable-130mm-aluminum-alloy-Lite-trail-mountain-bike_photo-by-Paul-Box-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty_affordable-130mm-aluminum-alloy-Lite-trail-mountain-bike_photo-by-Paul-Box-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>c.

The wheels do not include tubeless tape or valves, out of the bikeshop (or sealant). So then, it’s going to cost you a few bucks more to get the bike into a modern ridable state. But the key ingredients are there. Tire choice is also a huge personal preference, influenced by where you ride. A dry day with the Forekasters proved they can be a capable trail tire. But when the weather got super wet (like I ride back at home), those became the limiting factor for how far I could push the bike.

And I was happy to be able to carry plenty of water and spares to be self-sufficient for a long day out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Racing The EX Enduro on a short travel trail bike</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_photo-by-Paul-Box_The-EX-racing-NDS.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_photo-by-Paul-Box_The-EX-racing-NDS.jpg\" alt=\"Merida One-Twenty Review, affordable 130mm alloy trail mountain bike, photo by Paul Box, racing The EX enduro\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_photo-by-Paul-Box_The-EX-racing-NDS.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_photo-by-Paul-Box_The-EX-racing-NDS-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_photo-by-Paul-Box_The-EX-racing-NDS-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_photo-by-Paul-Box_The-EX-racing-NDS-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_photo-by-Paul-Box_The-EX-racing-NDS-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-Merida-One-Twenty-Review_130mm-alloy-trail-mountain-bike_photo-by-Paul-Box_The-EX-racing-NDS-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption><em>c.

Offered in aluminum, it’s also about as accessible as you could hope for in a modern full-suspension mountain bike. Plus, it kinda feels bombproof. If you are new to riding – it’s a solid first bike. If you already have a light XC race bike and want something a bit more burly. Or you already have a big travel bike and want something more pedaling-friendly – it’s also a pretty solid second bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"http://merida-bikes.com/\">Merida-bikes.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2024-merida-one-twenty-700-trail-mountain-bike-review/\">Review: Affordable Alloy Merida One-Twenty  Mountain Bike Tames More Trails at 130mm</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"f965102f052248ac3f03e8ce2b0377b66ea954f537aa089241a7b7e0db4540ee","category":"Cycling"}
