Carbon Disc wheelset range are designed to increase versatility and capability, reduce weight and improve acceleration and aerodynamics. Tyre compatibility is from 28mm up to 50mm in width and Hunt says that, although designed for road use, the wheels are suitable for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-gravel-bike\" target=\"_blank\">gravel riding</a> too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand has wind-tunnel-tested the new wheels at the GST WindKanal facility in Germany and claims an 8 watt aero advantage over a 25mm deep alloy wheelset. It says that the fastest wheelsets, such as Hunt’s own<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hunt-sub50-limitless-aero-disc-wheelset\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hunt-sub50-limitless-aero-disc-wheelset\" target=\"_blank\">SUB50 Limitless Aero Disc </a>wheelset and the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/enve-updates-ses-wheelset-range\" target=\"_blank\">Enve SES 4.5</a> wheelset are only around 4 watts more aero when fitted with 28mm tyres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the new rims, at 22mm internal width, are only 1mm wider than their predecessors, Hunt claims that this makes for a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/are-wider-tyres-faster\" target=\"_blank\">wider tyre</a>, improves the profile and lowers rolling resistance, and also improves cornering and dampens road vibrations better.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Hunt-Cabon-Disc-wheelset-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Hunt Carbon Disc wheelset 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Hunt-Cabon-Disc-wheelset-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Hunt-Cabon-Disc-wheelset-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Hunt-Cabon-Disc-wheelset-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Hunt-Cabon-Disc-wheelset-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Hunt-Cabon-Disc-wheelset-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Hunt-Cabon-Disc-wheelset-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Hunt-Cabon-Disc-wheelset-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Hunt-Cabon-Disc-wheelset-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Hunt-Cabon-Disc-wheelset-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Hunt-Cabon-Disc-wheelset-1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hunt has retained a hooked rim profile, rather than changing to a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hookless-rims\" target=\"_blank\">hookless bead</a> design.
