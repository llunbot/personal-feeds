According to a new report, we’ll have to wait a little longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Citing his own report from December that claimed Apple’s HomePod with display would arrive in the first quarter of 2025, <a href=\"https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1899850124828053800?s=61&amp;t=a-bloX1n-TZ50ofqhetO1A\">Ming-Chi Kuo now predicts</a> it will arrive in the third quarter due to “software development issues.” That’s not a surprise as we’ve heard numerous rumors about Apple’s struggles with delivering Apple Intelligence features, including the delay of the next-gen Siri to later in the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Intelligence is expected to play a major role in Apple’s smart home hub. While the device will have a touch screen, it will reportedly be voice-powered like a HomePod. Apple envisions the device as a stationary center of a home, either hanging on a wall or sitting on a dock. To accomplish that, Siri and Apple Intelligence will need to be bug-free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Kuo says, Apple wants to ensure the new interface “aligns with new OS updates (like iOS 19) set to roll out across other devices in 2H25.” A <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2632571/ios-19-and-macos-16-will-reportedly-bring-a-huge-interface-overhaul.html\">rumor from Mark Gurman</a> earlier this week claims that iOS 19 will deliver “one of the most dramatic software overhauls in the company’s history,” which could include cues from visionOS, such as circular icons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kuo says the visual alignment is “essential for seamlessly integrating new products into Apple’s ecosystem.” That sounds like Apple will be using the next generations of its operating systems to introduce a streamlined interface with a similar UI across all devices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is also expected to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">launch a new iPhone design</a> in September along with the first new model since the iPhone 14 Plus in 2022. Along with a redesigned iOS and a new HomePod with a display, Apple’s fall could be very, very exciting.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ccbbbca5ccd5d7e2fabba798e1d70876f0564463953de5e0203f51708724b079","category":"Apple"}
