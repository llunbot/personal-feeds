We’ve cut through the marketing to tell you exactly what’s changed with the new Tarmac SL8, as well as what is the same as the older Tarmac SL7.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which bike is better? On paper it’s clearly the SL8 as you’d expect, but some of the differences are fairly subtle and if you already have an SL7 and are happy with it, the SL8 is unlikely to feel like a radical upgrade.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Specialized Tarmac SL8 vs. Tarmac SL7: Key features at a glance</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tarmac SL8</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"596\"

end of the market occupied by the Tarmac aero is, as Specialized has said, everything. The headline-grabbing figure is the watts saved and Specialized claims a significant 16.6 watts on a flat 40km course when riding at 45kmh. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That number makes the Tarmac SL8 faster even than the late lamented <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-venge-pro-review\" target=\"_blank\">Venge</a> aero bike to which everyone compares the Tarmac. The brand says this equates to 128 seconds over the parcours of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/milan-san-remo\" target=\"_blank\">Milan-San Remo</a> classic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Famously, Specialized said that the Tarmac SL7 was almost as aero as the Venge when it was launched and ceased selling the Venge as a consequence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized says that the Tarmac SL8’s watt savings are due to three factors: a deeper head tube, a slimmer seat tube and the new <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/roval-rapide-cockpit\" target=\"_blank\">Roval Rapide integrated cockpit</a>. The designers have left less aerodynamically important parts of the bike alone, concentrating on smoothing the airflow over the frame’s leading edge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new, extended nose to the head tube, which Specialized calls Speed Sniffer, is a consequence of the UCI loosening the rules on tube profiles between the genesis of the SL7 and the SL8. Specialized says that although this adds 25g to the frame weight, it has allowed it to adopt a more aero profile for the head tube’s leading edge rather than following the round shape of the steerer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-9-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Tarmac SL8 bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-9-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-9-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-9-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-9-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-9-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-9-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-9-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-9-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-9.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Sam Challis</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At the rear, the seat tube is thinner on the SL8 than on the SL7, which reduces its aero profile, but has identical lateral stiffness. It also adds to the SL8’s comfort figures, providing Specialized’s 6 per cent compliance increase figure from more fore/aft flex. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s based on that of the non-aero <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-s-works-aethos-review-lightest-ever-disc-brake-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Aethos</a>, as Specialized says that there are minimal aero gains from a Kammtail shape, as the air flowing around the seat tube and seatpost is already turbulent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Shimano builds, the Di2 battery is held in a cradle below the bottom of the seatpost, rather than being inserted into it, as it was on the Tarmac SL7, as the seatpost is now too narrow to house it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cockpit: subtle savings</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-4-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Tarmac SL8 bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-4-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-4.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Sam Challis</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/roval-rapide-cockpit\" target=\"_blank\">Roval Rapide cockpit</a>, as fitted to the S-Works Tarmac SL8, was launched in June as a standalone item. It’s claimed to save 4 watts over the separate bar and stem of the Tarmac SL7, although it does reduce adjustability. The absence of a stem faceplate is a significant contributor to the savings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it’s offered in a total of 15 width/effective stem length combinations, chosen on the basis of Specialized’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/man-vs-machine-inside-contemporary-bike-fitting\" target=\"_blank\">Retul</a> bike fit data. Unfortunately, you’ll get the cockpit that Specialized has chosen for you rather than being able to choose your preferred configuration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized claims weight savings from the one piece design over the Tarmac SL7’s cockpit – 50 grams of them – as well as increased stiffness. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/05165256/specialized_tarmac_sl7_sb8-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"specialized_tarmac_sl7_sb8\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tarmac SL8 is also compatible with the SL7’s separate stem design if you want more adjustability and it can be used with any standard road bike handlebars. Pro spec bikes have a two-piece Roval Rapide carbon bar and Tarmac SL7 stem fitted, while Expert specs have Specialized Expert alloy bars with the Tarmac SL7 stem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Specialized Tarmac SL8 vs. Tarmac SL7 geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n\t<th> </th><th>44</th><th>49</th><th>52</th><th>54</th><th>56</th><th>58</th><th>61</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Crank Length</td><td>165</td><td>165</td><td>170</td><td>172.5</td><td>172.5</td><td>175</td><td>175</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Handlebar Width</td><td>380</td><td>380</td><td>400</td><td>420</td><td>420</td><td>440</td><td>440</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Stem Length</td><td>75</td><td>75</td><td>90</td><td>100</td><td>100</td><td>110</td><td>110</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Saddle Width</td><td>155</td><td>155</td><td>155</td><td>143</td><td>143</td><td>143</td><td>143</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Seatpost Length</td><td>300</td><td>300</td><td>300</td><td>380</td><td>380</td><td>380</td><td>380</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Frame Stack</td><td>501</td><td>514</td><td>527</td><td>544</td><td>565</td><td>591</td><td>612</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Frame Reach</td><td>366</td><td>375</td><td>380</td><td>384</td><td>395</td><td>402</td><td>408</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Stack to Stem</td><td>509</td><td>522</td><td>535</td><td>552</td><td>573</td><td>599</td><td>620</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Reach to Stem</td><td>363</td><td>372</td><td>377</td><td>381</td><td>393</td><td>400</td><td>406</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Head Tube</td><td>99</td><td>109</td><td>120</td><td>137</td><td>157</td><td>184</td><td>204</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>HTA</td><td>70.5°</td><td>71.75°</td><td>72.5°</td><td>73°</td><td>73.5°</td><td>73.5°</td><td>74°</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>BB Height</td><td>266</td><td>266</td><td>266</td><td>268</td><td>268</td><td>268</td><td>268</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>BB Drop</td><td>74</td><td>74</td><td>74</td><td>72</td><td>72</td><td>72</td><td>72</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Trail</td><td>71</td><td>63</td><td>58</td><td>58</td><td>55</td><td>55</td><td>52</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Fork Length, Full</td><td>370</td><td>370</td><td>370</td><td>370</td><td>370</td><td>370</td><td>370</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Fork Rake/Offset</td><td>47</td><td>47</td><td>47</td><td>44</td><td>44</td><td>44</td><td>44</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Front Center</td><td>572</td><td>574</td><td>577</td><td>579</td><td>592</td><td>606</td><td>613</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Chainstay</td><td>410</td><td>410</td><td>410</td><td>410</td><td>410</td><td>410</td><td>410</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Wheelbase</td><td>970</td><td>973</td><td>975</td><td>978</td><td>991</td><td>1006</td><td>1013</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Top Tube</td><td>496</td><td>509</td><td>531</td><td>541</td><td>563</td><td>577</td><td>595</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Standover </td><td>723</td><td>735</td><td>746</td><td>768</td><td>786</td><td>808</td><td>834</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Seat Tube</td><td>433</td><td>445</td><td>456</td><td>473</td><td>494</td><td>515</td><td>545</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>STA</td><td>75.5°</td><td>75.5°</td><td>74°</td><td>74°</td><td>73.5°</td><td>73.5°</td><td>73°</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>All figures except angles in mm</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Geometry-wise, Specialized says that there’s no difference between the Tarmac SL8 and the SL7, with its Retul fit database allowing it to refine the fit across the whole range of seven bike sizes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s not strictly accurate as the SL8 frame has a 10mm higher stack and a 3mm shorter reach. But once the different head tube top cap design is taken into account, the stack and reach to stem figures for the two bikes are exactly the same, so you should be able to achieve an identical fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are slight differences in the head tube length: that on the SL8 is 6mm or 7mm longer, depending on frame size. The fork on the SL8 is 4mm longer across the board and the seat tube 2mm shorter, but neither figure affects the bottom bracket height and drop. The SL8 has clearance for 32mm tyres – same as the SL7. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Specialized Tarmac SL8 vs. Tarmac SL7 weight</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-7-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Tarmac SL8 bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-7-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-7-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-7-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-7-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-7-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-7-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-7-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-7-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-7.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Sam Challis</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Tarmac SL7 weighed a claimed 800g, the new SL8 has a claimed weight of 685g for a painted size 56cm bike.

Along with the reduced weight of the Tarmac SL8 frame, Specialized says that this results in a stiffness-to-weight figure for the Tarmac SL8 that is 33 per cent higher than the Tarmac SL7.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized also claims that ride compliance, which we judged a plus for the SL7 when we reviewed it, has increased by 6 per cent despite the same frame stiffness figures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Specialized Tarmac SL8 vs. Tarmac SL7 price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The S-Works Tarmac SL7’s price reached scary numbers. These have been pegged back in the Tarmac SL8. A £1,000 price drop for the equivalent spec may sound like a lot, but in a bike priced at £12,000 in its top spec, it’s not a huge percentage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, it’s good to see Specialized’s prices for its bikes heading in the right direction after a period of substantial price inflation; when we reviewed the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-tarmac-sl7-review-end-of-the-venge\" target=\"_blank\">S-Works Tarmac SL7</a> in October 2020, its list price was £10,500, while as of August 2023 it’s currently listed at £13,000 on Specialized’s site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That price decrease has trickled down the range as well, making the Tarmac SL8 a slightly more affordable proposition than the Tarmac SL7, although it’s not currently offered in the lowest price Comp and Sport specs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Specialized Tarmac SL8 vs. Tarmac SL7 models</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"633\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-8-e1691395989793-970x633.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Tarmac SL8 bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-8-e1691395989793-970x633.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-8-e1691395989793-300x196.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-8-e1691395989793-768x502.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-8-e1691395989793-1536x1003.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-8-e1691395989793-750x490.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-8-e1691395989793-1140x744.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_first_ride_review-8-e1691395989793.jpg 1911w\" /><figcaption>Sam Challis</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tarmac SL8 will be available initially at just three spec levels: S-Works, Pro and Expert, with two groupset options each at S-Works and Pro levels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want the top spec bike, the flagship £12,000 S-Works Tarmac SL8 Dura-Ace Di2 is equipped with a 52/36 / 11-30 Dura-Ace groupset with a 4iiii Precision Pro dual-sided power meter and Roval Rapide CLX II tubeless-ready wheelset.
