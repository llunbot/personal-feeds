The sound seemed to show up when something caused an earbud to move or vibrate, such as walking or running.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple tried to fix the problem <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/06/airpods-pro-noise-cancellation-troubleshooting/\">with software updates</a>, but the company ultimately launched an ‌AirPods Pro‌ repair program <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/30/airpods-pro-sound-issues-service-program/\">in October 2020</a>. Customers with affected ‌AirPods Pro‌ were able to bring them to Apple for a fix or a replacement, but unfortunately, many customers found that their replacement ‌AirPods Pro‌ also suffered from the same issue.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs a result, Apple is now facing a class action lawsuit, with the plaintiffs requesting \"relief\" due to the defective nature of the ‌AirPods Pro‌. The complaint says that customers would not have purchased the ‌AirPods Pro‌ or would have paid less had Apple made the flaw clear.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is also being accused of false advertising for highlighting features like \"superior sound quality\" and \"pure, incredibly clear sound\" when knowing there was an issue with crackling and static.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe court will need to decide if the arguments made here hold up, and whether the case deserves class action certification.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/13/apple-airpods-pro-crackling-lawsuit/\">Apple Customers Sue Over Unfixed AirPods Pro Crackling Issue</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-customers-sue-over-unfixed-airpods-pro-crackling-issue.2442886/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9ea6b87ee12f62943dc0bf11a0fcf2351f7675cbfe029b0146c05719d1d95982","category":"Apple"}
