In such a scenario, the Space Force wants to have the capability to respond, either to deter an adversary from taking action or to defend a US satellite from an attack.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016629#p3\">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016629&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"40b1f2674d482426457b641a3b2f9b1c8fe94bc67c0b4d343b11140c54d5dbc3","category":"Tech"}
