The milky-white latex-based liquid, complete with synthetic or biodegradable particles that help to plug the hole, works magic when it comes to preventing punctures from letting you down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the first tubeless sealant for bike tyres was developed in 2001 by Stan’s, now there’s a huge range to choose from. You can buy different sealants for different bike tyre types, different temperature ranges and even different riding – meaning there’s a bit more to it than just pulling the first bottle you see off the shelf or choosing the first listing you find online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us demystify tubeless sealant for you in this guide, answering the most common questions about tubeless setups including how much sealant you need per tyre, and how often you’ll need to top it up. We’ve also got a list of our favourite sealants for road and gravel tyres to choose from, and why you might like to opt for them in your setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cyclist’s top picks of the best tubeless sealant for road and gravel bike tyres</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"#stans\">Stan’s Tyre Sealant 500ml</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"#peatys\">Peaty’s Holeshot Biofibre Sealant 1L</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"#mucoff\">Muc Off Tubeless Sealant 80ml</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"#wtb\">WTB Tubeless Tire Sealant 473ml</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"#effetto\">Effetto Mariposa Végétalex Tubeless Sealant 1000ml</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"#silca\">Silca Ultimate Tubeless Sealant 473ml</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"#vittoria\">Vittoria Universal Tubeless Tire Sealant 80ml</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"#orangeseal\">Orange Seal Sealant with injector 236ml</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep reading for more on each sealant and our <a href=\"#buyingadvice\">detailed buying advice.</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>How do we test and why trust our advice?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07102512/how_to_repair_a_tubeless_tyre_with_a_plug_pro_tips_for_fast_and_mess-free_repairs_on_the_go_2-41_screenshot-970x546.png\" alt=\"how_to_repair_a_tubeless_tyre_with_a_plug_pro_tips_for_fast_and_mess-free_repairs_on_the_go_2-41_screenshot\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07102512/how_to_repair_a_tubeless_tyre_with_a_plug_pro_tips_for_fast_and_mess-free_repairs_on_the_go_2-41_screenshot-970x546.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07102512/how_to_repair_a_tubeless_tyre_with_a_plug_pro_tips_for_fast_and_mess-free_repairs_on_the_go_2-41_screenshot-300x169.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07102512/how_to_repair_a_tubeless_tyre_with_a_plug_pro_tips_for_fast_and_mess-free_repairs_on_the_go_2-41_screenshot-768x432.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07102512/how_to_repair_a_tubeless_tyre_with_a_plug_pro_tips_for_fast_and_mess-free_repairs_on_the_go_2-41_screenshot-1536x864.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07102512/how_to_repair_a_tubeless_tyre_with_a_plug_pro_tips_for_fast_and_mess-free_repairs_on_the_go_2-41_screenshot-750x422.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07102512/how_to_repair_a_tubeless_tyre_with_a_plug_pro_tips_for_fast_and_mess-free_repairs_on_the_go_2-41_screenshot-1140x641.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07102512/how_to_repair_a_tubeless_tyre_with_a_plug_pro_tips_for_fast_and_mess-free_repairs_on_the_go_2-41_screenshot.png 1920w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are <em>Cyclist </em>we’re always keen to try out and adopt new cycling tech, and the rise of tubeless tyre systems has been a prime example.

Muc-Off recommends using 50-60ml for 28mm road tyres, or 70-80ml for gravel tyres up to 45mm, and replacing the sealant every 3-6 months (or sooner in hot, dry climates).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pouches also have a clear window, so you can easily see how much you have left, and roughly measure out your required amount against the graduated scale. The narrow nozzle also makes application through the valve easy, once you’ve removed the valve core, if you don’t want to unseat the tyre.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>WTB Tubeless Tire Sealant 473ml</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/WTB-tubeless-sealant-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/WTB-tubeless-sealant-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/WTB-tubeless-sealant-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/WTB-tubeless-sealant-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/WTB-tubeless-sealant-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/WTB-tubeless-sealant-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/WTB-tubeless-sealant-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/WTB-tubeless-sealant-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/WTB-tubeless-sealant-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/WTB-tubeless-sealant-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/WTB-tubeless-sealant-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Katherine Moore</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>RRP: £20</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ammonia-free formula with synthetic latex and mica particulates</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Optimised for temperatures down to -9°C </strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Designed to work well in the wet</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A sealant to be fitted directly into the tyre, rather than via the valve, the WTB Tubeless Tire Sealant is based on a ‘tackifying’ sealing process, rather than an ammonia-based formula that relies on evaporation.

Combined, these create an airtight space within the tyre for the sealant without needing an inner tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The liquid natural or latex-based sealant lines the inside surface of the tyre and flows around the tyre. When the tyre is punctured, whether that’s a thorn, shard of glass or complete hole, the sealant in the tyre flows to the affected area. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like how blood forms a clot at a cut in the skin by delivering platelets to the area, sealant features suspended particles – such as natural or synthetic fibres, crystals or glitter – which are carried to the puncture area and help the latex form a seal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These seals can be permanent, and in some cases so effective that you might not even know that you’ve punctured at all. At other times, with more severe punctures, you may need the additional support of a<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-tubeless-repair-kit\" target=\"_blank\"> tubeless plug</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How much tubeless sealant do I need to use per tyre?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>How much sealant you’ll need to use depends on three factors; the size of your tyre (and wheel), the sealant manufacturer’s recommendations, and whether you want additional protection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Larger tyres will need a greater volume of sealant, as there’s a greater internal surface area to cover and further for the sealant to travel to get to a puncture. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manufacturer recommendations vary a little according to different sealant formulas. Here are just a few: </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sealant</strong></td><td><strong>Road tyres </strong></td><td><strong>Gravel tyres</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Muc-Off</td><td>50-60ml</td><td>70-80ml</td></tr><tr><td>Peaty’s</td><td>30-45ml</td><td>60-75ml</td></tr><tr><td>Stan’s</td><td>60ml</td><td>60ml</td></tr><tr><td>WTB</td><td>57-114ml</td><td>57-114ml</td></tr><tr><td>Orange Seal </td><td>56ml</td><td>85ml</td></tr><tr><td>Vittoria</td><td>56ml</td><td>85-118ml</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Many manufacturers recommend adding an additional 30ml to your setup if you’re seeking extra protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can I reuse tubeless sealant?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. If you’re switching between tyres and your sealant is still liquid, transfer it over to the new tyre and top up the volume accordingly. If you’ve had your sealant in the original tyre for a while, it may have dried up, so you won’t be able to reuse it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How often do I need to replace tubeless sealant?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Different sealant formulas have been designed to last for different lengths of time. It’s a balancing act; for example Orange Seal’s standard formula is the most effective at plugging holes according to the brand, yet only lasts six weeks. Its Endurance sealant lasts twice as long, but you lose a little of the sealant’s efficacy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check your chosen sealant for recommendations on how often you need to replace it. Also factor in environmental conditions, as sealant will dry out much quicker in hot and dry climates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few manufacturer recommendations;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sealant</strong></td><td><strong>Replacement interval</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Muc-Off Road and Gravel </td><td>3-6 months or 750 miles </td></tr><tr><td>Peaty’s</td><td>Up to 6 months</td></tr><tr><td>Stan’s</td><td>2-7 months</td></tr><tr><td>Orange Seal original </td><td>1.5 months</td></tr><tr><td>Orange Seal endurance</td><td>3 months</td></tr><tr><td>Silca</td><td>Add Replenisher every 3-4 months</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure you replace your sealant regularly to ensure there’s always enough liquid sealant in your tyre to plug holes effectively. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can you use the same tubeless sealant for road, gravel and mountain bike tyres?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes and no. Most brands have designed their sealants to be universal, but others, such as Muc-Off, have specific sealants for road and gravel or mountain biking applications. The main differences are the required tyre pressure range and the size of the potential holes or tears. Having said that, there is a lot of overlap between the two, so you could probably go for either if you were really in a pinch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read our guides to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/cyclist-guide-to-road-bike-tubeless-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">best tubeless road bike tyres</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-gravel-bike-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">best gravel bike tyres</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-tubeless-repair-kit\" target=\"_blank\">best tubeless repair kits</a> to complete your tubeless set-up.</em></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hookless-rims\">Hooked vs hookless rims: Pros, cons and which is right for you</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/are-wider-tyres-faster\">Are wider road bike tyres faster?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/which-is-faster-continental-gp5000-tubeless-or-clincher\">Which is faster: Continental GP5000 tubeless or clincher?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/cyclist-guide-to-road-bike-tubeless-tyres\">Best tubeless road tyres 2024: Cyclist’s guide to road bike tubeless tyres (video)</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-tubeless-sealant\">Best tubeless sealant for road and gravel bike tyres</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"1b857e5ca3463770e5f3a3ccac01c5da870df6502999ff5b22e8c31826e09ed4","category":"Cycling"}
