{"title":"Henry Blodget’s Illustrated 2013 Travelogue of Flying in Coach on a Long International Flight","link":"https://www.salon.com/2013/01/28/henry_blodgets_kind_of_awful_plane_ride/","date":1745612558000,"content":"\n<p>Andrew Leonard, writing for Salon back in 2013:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first thing wrong with the stupidest article to be posted to\nthe Internet in the year 2013 — and possibly the entire century — is the title: “<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/american-airlines-international-economy-class-2013-1?op=1#ixzz2JIlmxu88\">I Was Quite Surprised By Some Things On My\nAmerican Airlines International ‘Economy Class’ Flight</a>.” Even\nsetting aside the high probability that author Henry Blodget, the\nfounder, CEO and editor-in-chief of Business Insider, wrote his\naccount of the mild horrors of nine hours cramped in the cheap\nseats in order to purposely troll people like me who would\nruthlessly mock him and thus drive even more traffic to his site,\nthe low-rent search-engine optimization of Blodget’s headline\nwould still be a crime against journalism. Blodget’s made many\nmistakes in the past, not least the dot-com boom-era stock hyping\nescapades that got him banned from the securities industry for\nlife, but this inane tale of 34,000-feet-high horror marks a new\nlow. The man should now be denied access to a keyboard for life,\nor until the heat death of the universe, whichever comes first.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My working theory has always been that both things can be true: Henry Blodget really is an idiotic jackass <em>and</em> he’s actually clever at crafting clickbait stories. One of Blodget’s complaints is that his laptop died after 3 hours, and he didn’t bring anything to read, leaving him 5 hours with nothing to do. I’m only slightly exaggerating when I say I’d be more likely to jump out of an airplane without a parachute than I would be to board a flight without plenty of stuff to read.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/25/blodget-coach\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d9b943eda2dc8c87d17b323a87df7e129b542eb03c4db5ed26d759bf1f36cfad","category":"Tech"}
