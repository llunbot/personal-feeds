It's set to premiere in June, and HBO is ramping up its marketing with a rather clever twist: not one official trailer, but two, each presenting the perspective of one side in the bloody conflict. And we get to choose which trailer we'd like to view—although if you're like us, you'll elect to watch both.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for the first season below.)</strong></p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/12/tensions-rise-between-targaryens-in-first-teaser-for-house-of-the-dragon-s2/\">I've written</a> previously, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/review-house-of-the-dragon-prequel-series-makes-a-solid-debut/\" target=\"_blank\">HBO's <em>House of the Dragon</em></a> debuted in 2022 with a solid, promising pilot episode, and the remainder of the season lived up to that initial promise. The series is set nearly 200 years before the events of <em>Game of Thrones </em>and chronicles the beginning of the end of House Targaryen's reign. The primary source material is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_%26_Blood_(novel)\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fire and Blood</em></a>, a fictional history of the Targaryen kings written by George R.R. Martin. As book readers know, those events culminated in a civil war and the extinction of the dragons—at least until Daenerys Targaryen came along.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011934#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011934&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a34b2629ca0b2fa8f0a8758bafb9e9198b7f639d5fe58e69aced50fe7c1925a1","category":"Tech"}
