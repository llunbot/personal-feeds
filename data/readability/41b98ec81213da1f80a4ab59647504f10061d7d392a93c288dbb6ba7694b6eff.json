The overhaul saw Nukeproof replace 29mm WTB rims with their very own 30mm internal width rims. They maintain a symmetrical profile, but now lace those rims to the Horizon V2 fast engagement hub, increasing the POE from 42 to 102. Reasonably priced at £399.98, this wheelset is likely an attractive option for folk looking to upgrade their OEM wheelset, especially in the knowledge that Team CRC spent the 2021 EWS Season on them.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21115838/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheel-review-taped-rim-profile.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21115838/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheel-review-taped-rim-profile.jpg\" alt=\"nukeproof horizon v2 rims\" width=\"1600\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21115838/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheel-review-taped-rim-profile.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21115838/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheel-review-taped-rim-profile-297x99.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21115838/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheel-review-taped-rim-profile-800x267.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21115838/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheel-review-taped-rim-profile-120x40.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21115838/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheel-review-taped-rim-profile-768x256.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21115838/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheel-review-taped-rim-profile-1536x512.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>I’ve spent a solid six months riding the Nukeproof Horizon V2 alloy wheelset on my local enduro trails in the Tweed Valley, Scotland; recent host to the EWS season finale, might I add. I’ve also ventured out of the valley to the granite rock descents of Fort William and Aberdeenshire, the fast and loose downhill tracks at One Giant Leap in Wales, the lesser-spotted loamy singletrack of the Lake District, as well as the sculpted berms and booters of Bike Park Wales. Thus, I’m satisfied this wheelset has been put through its paces sufficiently. Here’s how it fared.</p><h2>Review: Nukeproof Horizon V2 Wheelset</h2><div id=\"attachment_275712\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21115826/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheel-review-hero.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-275712\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21115826/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheel-review-hero.jpg\" alt=\"nukeproof horizon v2 wheelset review\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21115826/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheel-review-hero.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21115826/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheel-review-hero-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21115826/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheel-review-hero-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21115826/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheel-review-hero-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21115826/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheel-review-hero-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21115826/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheel-review-hero-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-275712\">The Nukeproof Horizon V2 wheels are hand built, laced with 32 J-Bend spokes laced in a three-cross pattern to 6-bolt hubs</p></div><p>The 27.5″ Nukeproof Horizon V2 wheelset arrived taped with their tire insert compatible tubeless valves pre-installed, ready for a quick tubeless setup.

At 26 PSI, containing a Vittoria Airliner insert, the DHR II measured 2.28″ wide, with the sidewalls standing marginally proud of the outboard edge of the side knobs. Throughout the test period, this rim-tire combination has held pressure very well, with no issues seating the bead onto the rim. The rim tape has been changed once as it was nicked during a tire insert install at some point along the way.</p><h3>Horizon V2 On The Trail</h3><div id=\"attachment_275702\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21113119/nukeproof-horizon-v2-mtb-wheelset-alloy-long-term-review-fanderson-023.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-275702\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21113119/nukeproof-horizon-v2-mtb-wheelset-alloy-long-term-review-fanderson-023.jpg\" alt=\"nukeproof horizon v2 wheelset review ride feel cornering\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21113119/nukeproof-horizon-v2-mtb-wheelset-alloy-long-term-review-fanderson-023.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21113119/nukeproof-horizon-v2-mtb-wheelset-alloy-long-term-review-fanderson-023-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21113119/nukeproof-horizon-v2-mtb-wheelset-alloy-long-term-review-fanderson-023-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21113119/nukeproof-horizon-v2-mtb-wheelset-alloy-long-term-review-fanderson-023-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21113119/nukeproof-horizon-v2-mtb-wheelset-alloy-long-term-review-fanderson-023-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21113119/nukeproof-horizon-v2-mtb-wheelset-alloy-long-term-review-fanderson-023-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-275702\">Credit: Finlay Anderson</p></div><p>I have no qualms on the ride feel of the Nukeproof Horizon V2 wheelset.

The 3.52° engagement of the hub is a welcome update, delivering fast pickup when you want to put in that quick half-pedal stroke through technical terrain, and when you need to get back on the pedals frequently through undulating terrain. The 0.12mm thick pawl springs deliver a loud buzzing sound when freewheeling, feedback as to how fast or slow you’re rolling. You can upgrade to thinner 0.1mm pawl springs if you’d prefer a quieter hub.</p><div id=\"attachment_275970\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/22055433/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheelset-review-riding-loose-rocks-roots.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-275970\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/22055433/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheelset-review-riding-loose-rocks-roots.jpg\" alt=\"nukeproof horizon v2 wheelset review riding fast loose rocky section braking hard\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/22055433/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheelset-review-riding-loose-rocks-roots.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/22055433/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheelset-review-riding-loose-rocks-roots-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/22055433/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheelset-review-riding-loose-rocks-roots-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/22055433/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheelset-review-riding-loose-rocks-roots-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/22055433/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheelset-review-riding-loose-rocks-roots-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/22055433/nukeproof-horizon-v2-wheelset-review-riding-loose-rocks-roots-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-275970\">Credit: Finlay Anderson</p></div><p>Aside from that, I don’t have too much to say about ride feel.

They still spring back freely when compressed, with no hint of sticking. The hub internals had suffered dirt ingress, as is to be expected after 6 months of UK riding.</p><p>The Enduro ABEC 5 bearings inside the hub are, admittedly, quite rough, and will soon be in need of replacement. That’s not a complaint; this wheelset has seen a great many miles, having survived a whole season of enduro riding and racing. The bearings have an LLB/LLU full contact seal type with two lips that make light contact within a groove.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21114257/nukeproof-horizon-v2-alloy-wheelset-review-rim-ding-flat-spot.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21114257/nukeproof-horizon-v2-alloy-wheelset-review-rim-ding-flat-spot.jpg\" alt=\"nukeproof horizon v2 rim damage\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21114257/nukeproof-horizon-v2-alloy-wheelset-review-rim-ding-flat-spot.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21114257/nukeproof-horizon-v2-alloy-wheelset-review-rim-ding-flat-spot-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21114257/nukeproof-horizon-v2-alloy-wheelset-review-rim-ding-flat-spot-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21114257/nukeproof-horizon-v2-alloy-wheelset-review-rim-ding-flat-spot-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21114257/nukeproof-horizon-v2-alloy-wheelset-review-rim-ding-flat-spot-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21114257/nukeproof-horizon-v2-alloy-wheelset-review-rim-ding-flat-spot-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>How about the rims? Only one incident of note, here. I put one ding in the rear rim while riding <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020/08/10/video-liam-moynihan-jessie-may-morgan-ride-uks-longest-enduro-track-top-chief/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fort William’s Top Chief</a> descent, the offending article being a chunk of granite rock which makes up a good 70% of the trail’s surface. Running 22 PSI in an EXO+ casing tire with CushCore Pro installed wasn’t enough to protect the rim entirely. Externally, the ding is subtle but damage to the rim bed is evident upon closer inspection. There’s also a <em>very</em> subtle flat spot in the rim as a result, too. The wheel is no longer true, with the non driveside spokes having lost measurable (by feel) tension in some areas.</p><div id=\"attachment_275708\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21114254/nukeproof-horizon-v2-alloy-wheel-review-rim-damage.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-275708\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21114254/nukeproof-horizon-v2-alloy-wheel-review-rim-damage.jpg\" alt=\"nukeproof horizon v2 aesthetic rim damage\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21114254/nukeproof-horizon-v2-alloy-wheel-review-rim-damage.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21114254/nukeproof-horizon-v2-alloy-wheel-review-rim-damage-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21114254/nukeproof-horizon-v2-alloy-wheel-review-rim-damage-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21114254/nukeproof-horizon-v2-alloy-wheel-review-rim-damage-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21114254/nukeproof-horizon-v2-alloy-wheel-review-rim-damage-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/21114254/nukeproof-horizon-v2-alloy-wheel-review-rim-damage-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-275708\">Top left; the one and only rim ding sustained over 6 months of riding, Top Right and Bottom Right; aesthetic damage to the rim finish, Bottom Left; no damage at the sleeved rim join</p></div><p>To come away with the abovementioned damage only, after being the subject of several tire insert tests where pressures were dropped as low as 12 PSI (more often around 17 PSI), is credit to the rim strength.
