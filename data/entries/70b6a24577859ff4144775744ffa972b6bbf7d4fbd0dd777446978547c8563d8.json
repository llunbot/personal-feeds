A tool like the Ugreen USB-C Hub will turn one of your ports into four, so it’s good news that it’s available for its best price yet at Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Adapter-Multiport-Splitter-MacBook/dp/B0C4DFB8RH?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">coming down from its MSRP of $35 to a mere $22 for Prime members</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This 4-Port USB-C 3.2 hub offers impressive 10Gbps data transfer speeds, which means you can transfer a 20GB file in just a little over 16 seconds. Whether it’s your extensive photo library, work files, or videos you’re working on, you’ll quickly move them from one device to another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of having this super fast way to transfer files, the Ugreen hub plays another role – giving you a way to connect more peripherals. From flash drives to mice, keyboards, and external hard drives. One thing you won’t be able to do with this hub is charge your devices. The USB-C ports do not support video output or charging, so you should keep that in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a limited-time deal so you’ll have to hurry up if you want to snag the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Adapter-Multiport-Splitter-MacBook/dp/B0C4DFB8RH?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Ugreen USB-C Hub for just $22 at Amazon</a>.
