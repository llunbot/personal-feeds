{"title":"The AnandTech A15 SoC Performance Review","link":"https://www.anandtech.com/show/16983/the-apple-a15-soc-performance-review-faster-more-efficient/","date":1633707689000,"content":"\n<p>Andrei Frumusanu, writing for AnandTech:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the GPU side, Apple’s peak performance improvements are off the\ncharts, with a combination of a new larger GPU, new architecture,\nand the larger system cache that helps both performance as well as\nefficiency.</p>\n\n<p>Apple’s iPhone component design seems to be limiting the SoC from\nachieving even better results, especially the newer Pro models,\nhowever even with that being said and done, Apple remains far\nabove the competition in terms of performance and efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, while the A15 isn’t the brute force iteration we’ve\nbecome used to from Apple in recent years, it very much comes with\nsubstantial generational gains that allow it to be a notably\nbetter SoC than the A14. In the end, it seems like Apple’s SoC\nteam has executed well after all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A thorough review, as usual. Interesting to contrast with <a href=\"https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/apple-cpu-gains-grind-to-a-halt-and\">Dylan Patel’s much-publicized “Apple CPU Gains Grind to a Halt and the Future Looks Dim” hot take</a> last month, just after the Apple event. The A15 seems more about efficiency — and thus extending battery life — than going faster, but it <em>does</em> go faster, too.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/08/anandtech-a15-review\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1631c48d3931a4596f5812e5fd2f2312009748975e4227659d0a1c4f3918f950","category":"Tech"}
