Research has revealed the <a href=\"https://www.scienceabc.com/nature/animals/how-smart-is-an-octopus.html\">brain power</a> of the octopus allows it to unscrew a jar or navigate a maze. But, like many children, the octopus also develops an impish tendency to push the boundaries of behavior. Several aquariums have found octopuses <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/04/14/new-england-aquarium-has-its-own-octopus-escape-story/3ShjEIp3tdIAqbLGPLtuSO/story.html\">memorizing guard schedules</a> to sneak into nearby tanks to steal fish; meanwhile, marine biologists have discovered that wild octopuses will <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/science-environment-55426583\">punch fish</a>… for no apparent reason.</p>\n<p>According to Dr. <a href=\"https://www.ulethbridge.ca/unews/person/dr-jennifer-mather\">Jennifer Maher</a>, a professor at the University of Lethbridge in Canada, there are a “number of [different] types of learning [for octopuses]: cognitive tasks like tool use, memory of complex operations for future use, and observational learning.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930115#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930115&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"05be811b2236a8f85215da906bdf7b6fa9856389447a95028d978228771de581","category":"Tech"}
