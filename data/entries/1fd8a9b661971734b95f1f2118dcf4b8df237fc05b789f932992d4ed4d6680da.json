Instead of processing data in the binary state of zeros and ones, quantum computers run on qubits, which encompass myriad states all at once. This new capability promises to bring about new discoveries of unprecedented scale in a host of fields, including metallurgy, chemistry, drug discovery, and financial modeling.</p>\n<h2>Averting the cryptopocalypse</h2>\n<p>One of the most disruptive changes quantum computing will bring is the breaking of some of the most common forms of encryption, specifically, the RSA cryptosystem and those based on elliptic curves. These systems are the workhorses that banks, governments, and online services around the world have relied on for more than four decades to keep their most sensitive data confidential. RSA and elliptic curve encryption keys securing web connections would require millions of years to be cracked using today’s computers. A quantum computer could crack the same keys in a matter of hours or minutes.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/heres-how-windows-11-aims-to-make-the-world-safe-in-the-post-quantum-era/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/heres-how-windows-11-aims-to-make-the-world-safe-in-the-post-quantum-era/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1fd8a9b661971734b95f1f2118dcf4b8df237fc05b789f932992d4ed4d6680da","category":"Tech"}
