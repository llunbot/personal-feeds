(You can still <a href=\"https://reinvent.awsevents.com/register/?trk=www.google.com\">register to attend in-person or remotely</a>.) For both in-person and remote attendees, we’re pleased to share the latest news on our long-standing relationship with Amazon and how we help organizations provision, secure, run, and connect applications running in AWS.</p>\n\n<p>Whether organizations go fully cloud-native or maintain a hybrid infrastructure combining cloud and on-premises resources, HashiCorp products are instrumental in supporting those diverse environments. For many organizations, <a href=\"https://www.terraform.io/\">HashiCorp Terraform</a> is the preferred way to provision resources on AWS at scale. Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.vaultproject.io/\">HashiCorp Vault</a> is central to adopting zero trust security on AWS. And <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NWWWpp6YxU&amp;t=116s\">increasingly</a>, <a href=\"https://www.consul.io/\">HashiCorp Consul</a> is how DevOps teams choose to automate networking across AWS runtimes.</p>\n\n<p>HashiCorp and AWS recently achieved a remarkable milestone: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-insights/two-billion-downloads-of-the-terraform-aws-provider-shows-value-of-iac-for-infrastructure-management/\">2 billion downloads of the AWS provider for Terraform</a> — less than one year after the provider <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/aws-and-hashicorp-s-journey-to-1-billion-terraform-aws-provider-downloads\">reached 1 billion downloads</a>. This milestone underscores the growing recognition of the need for standardized infrastructure as code (IaC) solutions as organizations scale. Terraform plays a pivotal role in empowering application teams to compose, reuse, and collaborate effectively on infrastructure provisioning, ultimately accelerating the build and deployment process.</p>\n\n<p>In 2023, HashiCorp is an Emerald sponsor of re:Invent and we have a <a href=\"https://events.hashicorp.com/awsreinvent2023\">full program</a> of events where attendees can learn and network at the show. Here are some highlights: </p>\n\n<h2>Visit us at booth 800</h2>\n\n<p>Stop by our booth at the main entrance for daily demos and technical sessions on how to provision, secure, connect, and run applications on AWS.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Product demos</strong>: Meet with technical experts and stop by our booth theater for hourly 15-minute demos on Terraform, Vault, Consul, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Technical deep dives</strong>: Get your questions answered at whiteboard sessions about specifics across our infrastructure and security portfolio.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited-edition swag:</strong> Learn about our products and play in the HashiCorp booth Game Zone to win exclusive swag.</li>\n<li><strong>Integration highlights:</strong> Learn more about how we integrate and innovate with AWS to boost developer productivity, mitigate risk, and maximize cloud investments. </li>\n<li><strong>Community:</strong> Come meet with us and learn more about our products, local user groups, certifications, learning, and more. </li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1700581053-booth-800.png\" alt=\"re:Invent\" /><h2>Find us on stage</h2>\n\n<p>HashiCorp will be presenting three breakout sessions at re:Invent. Sign up in the <a href=\"https://hub.reinvent.awsevents.com/attendee-portal/catalog/?trk=www.google.com\">AWS Session Catalog</a> for the sessions below: </p>\n\n<p><strong>Building a multi-account, multi-runtime, service-oriented architecture</strong></p>\n\n<p>Tuesday, Nov. 28 from 11 a.m. - 12 p.m. | Caesar’s Palace - Forum 121</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>As organizations scale their applications and teams, adopting a service-oriented architecture (SOA) can improve scalability, flexibility, and agility. This session will walk through a journey from zero to scale, discussing when and how an organization should implement SOA. Attendees will learn how to set up a multi-account, multi-runtime microservices architecture at scale using Amazon ECS, EKS, and EC2 along with HashiCorp Terraform, Consul, Boundary, and Vault.</li>\n<li>Session ID: DOP316-S</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Run modern PKI workflows with HCP Vault on AWS</strong></p>\n\n<p>Tuesday, Nov. 28 from 2 p.m. - 3 p.m. | Venetian - Murano 3306</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Learn how to use HCP Vault with AWS Certificate Manager to enable your organization's modern PKI, certificate authority, and certificate management workflows to secure service-to-service communication on Amazon EKS. By leveraging Vault workflows and automation, you can avoid expensive expired certificate outages and run more efficiently without a lot of manual processes or heroics.</li>\n<li>Session ID: SEC201-S</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Self-service infrastructure is no longer a dream</strong></p>\n\n<p>Wednesday, Nov. 29 from 11:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. | Venetian - Bellini 2105</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Platform teams can use Terraform Cloud, HCP Waypoint, and the AWS Service Catalog to create simplified Terraform-based workflows for developers.
