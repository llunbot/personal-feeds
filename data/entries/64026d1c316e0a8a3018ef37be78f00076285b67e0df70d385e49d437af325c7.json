{"title":"Apple’s newest iPad drops to its best price yet","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2761698/apples-newest-ipad-drops-to-its-best-price-yet.html","date":1745424884000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The new iPad is already a great value at $350, but today’s deal drops the price by another $30. This means you can get the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ751XN6\">new iPad in blue or yellow for $320 at Amazon</a>, the lowest price we’ve ever seen and a fantastic bargain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Launched just a month ago, the 11th-generation iPad is the most affordable iPad you can get right now. The tablet’s 11-inch display looks as gorgeous as ever, delivering vivid colors, great contrast, and enough brightness to make it easy for you to see anything on the screen, no matter the lighting conditions. It also now comes with 128GB of storage (twice the previous model) to use for apps, games, and pictures. That’s quite a bit and we’re particularly happy to see this is now the baseline for iPads at the same price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2646985/ipad-a16-review.html\">reviewed the A16 iPad</a>, we gave it a 4-star rating and appreciated just how affordable it is, as well as its bright screen and overall strong performance. We also loved the impressive battery life, getting quite a few hours of fun out of the tablet. The only real trade-off is that you won’t be playing with Apple Intelligence with this tablet because the A16 chip doesn’t support it. Given the current state of Apple’s AI project, that’s not much of a loss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go grab <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ751XN6\">the new A16 iPad for $320</a> and get a great tablet at a great price. We’d suggest acting fast because these kind of Apple deals don’t tend to stick around for long.</p>\n\n\n<span>Save $30 on the iPad A16</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ751XN6\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"64026d1c316e0a8a3018ef37be78f00076285b67e0df70d385e49d437af325c7","category":"Apple"}
