Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold and Mesa County registered elector Heidi Jeanne Hess had petitioned the court for a ruling that Peters and Deputy Clerk Belinda Knisley are unable to perform the functions of the Designated Election Official for the November 2021 election.</p>\n<p>The \"court determines that the petitioners have met the burden of showing that Peters and Knisley have committed a breach and neglect of duty and other wrongful acts,\" Mesa County District Court Judge Valerie Robison wrote in <a href=\"https://coloradosos.gov/pubs/newsRoom/pressReleases/2021/20211013Order-VerifiedPetitionForRelief.pdf\">Wednesday's ruling</a>. \"As such, Peters and Knisley are unable or unwilling to appropriately perform the duties of the Mesa County Designated Election Official.
