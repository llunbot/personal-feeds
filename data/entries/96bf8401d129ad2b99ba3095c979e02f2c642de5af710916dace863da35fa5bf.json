Zwift just rolled out Bike Upgrades in the Drop Shop, giving riders more ways to fine-tune their virtual machines. That’s right—you can now upgrade your favorite frames instead of just swapping them out, dialing in performance tweaks that could give you the edge on race day. And if that wasn’t enough, Zwift has also introduced three new ‘Halo Bikes’ from Specialized, Cannondale, and Pinarello—offering serious bragging rights for those willing to grind for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-Pinarello-indepth-.png\"><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-Pinarello-indepth-.png\" alt=\"Zwift Halo Bikes Drop shop Pinarello indepth\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-Pinarello-indepth-.png 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-Pinarello-indepth--297x167.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-Pinarello-indepth--1536x864.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-Pinarello-indepth--120x68.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-Pinarello-indepth--768x432.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-Pinarello-indepth--1200x675.png 1200w\" /></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.zwift.com/create-account\">(Images: Zwift)</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bike Upgrades: Build Your Dream Setup</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing beats New Bike Day, but what if you could fine-tune your existing rig instead of starting from scratch? That’s precisely what Zwift’s new Bike Upgrade System brings. Every frame in your garage now comes with its own upgrade path, allowing you to unlock up to five performance boosts:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Aero Gains</strong> – Cut through the wind like a TT machine.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Weight Reduction</strong> – Climb faster, suffer less.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Drivetrain Efficiency</strong> – More watts, less waste.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>XP Boost (+5%)</strong> – Level up quicker.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Drops Boost (+5%)</strong> – Stack that Zwift currency even faster.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-process-.png\"><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-process-.png\" alt=\"Zwift Halo Bikes Drop shop process\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-process-.png 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-process--297x167.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-process--1536x864.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-process--120x68.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-process--768x432.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-process--1200x675.png 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Peep the specs on the Zwift BMX Bandit. Not great, but still a fun bike!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To upgrade a bike, you’ll need to equip it, complete specific in-game challenges, and then spend your hard-earned Drops to unlock the next tier. The system rewards dedication, and just like real-world tinkering, you’ll need to put in some miles to see the benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-all-.png\"><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-all-.png\" alt=\"Zwift Halo Bikes Drop shop all\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-all-.png 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-all--297x167.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-all--1536x864.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-all--120x68.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-all--768x432.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zwift-Halo-Bikes-Drop-shop-all--1200x675.png 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>The ‘Halo Bikes’: Rare, Fast &amp; Full of History</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest Halo Bikes offer an ultra-exclusive challenge for those looking to flex their Zwift cred.
