Things didn’t work out for Jan on that run, so he returned before the season ended and it worked out in his favor:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Jan set a new FKT (Fastest Known Time) on the epic Oregon Outback course. Riding unsupported and alone, he covered the 585 km (363 miles) of rough gravel (and some pavement) in 26:13 hours, taking more than an hour off the previous best. Jan averaged 13.8 mph (22.3 km/h) – stops included. It was a beautiful ride, traversing some of the country’s most spectacular scenery. It was also a great test for the concept of the all-road bike – a bike that can travel on rough gravel with road bike speed and road bike fun. Jan was riding a custom-built Rene Herse steel bike, equipped with <a href=\"https://www.renehersecycles.com/shop/components/tires/26-inch/26x23-rat-trap-pass/\" target=\"_blank\">26” x 2.3” Rene Herse Rat Trap Pass Extralight tires</a>. Flexible fork blades helped with comfort and speed on the notoriously rough surfaces of the Oregon Outback. Wind tunnel-tested aero fenders helped tackle the infamous winds on the approach to the Columbia Gorge. Jan observed at the finish: “The gravel roads of eastern Oregon will always be rough, but this is as good as it gets. It was fun!”</p></blockquote>\n<p>A full track of the FKT ride is at <a href=\"http://trackleaders.com/oregonoutbackautumn21f\" target=\"_blank\">Trackleaders</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"7f885d93fc03e40c5562f4de902341118d051144978d20a6b8df6bcc1243d157","category":"Cycling"}
