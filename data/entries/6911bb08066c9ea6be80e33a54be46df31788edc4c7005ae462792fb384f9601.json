Before it, there was practically no oxygen in the atmosphere; after, there was.</p>\n<p>Conventionally, the rise of oxygen is seen as life triumphantly terraforming a passive planet. But we’re learning now that Earth was an active participant, and it took two more big lifts of oxygen over the succeeding 2 billion years before it reached breathable levels. So which was more responsible for oxygen’s rise on Earth: the evolution of life or the evolution of the planet? Nature or nurture? And does the same answer apply to all of the rises of oxygen in Earth’s past?</p>\n<p>It’s a question beyond curiosity about our past, as it also affects how we might interpret signs of life on exoplanets.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933473#p3\">Read 57 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933473&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Howard Lee","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6911bb08066c9ea6be80e33a54be46df31788edc4c7005ae462792fb384f9601","category":"Tech"}
