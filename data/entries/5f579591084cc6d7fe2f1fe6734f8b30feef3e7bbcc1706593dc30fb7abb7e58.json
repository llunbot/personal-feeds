Authors and commenters might chain 10 commands together with pipes and angle brackets—something I never did in day-to-day system administration. Honestly, I doubted the real-world value of that. Surely, this was just an exercise in e-braggadocio, right?</p>\n<p>Trying to read the man pages for the utilities most frequently seen in these extended command chains didn't make them seem more approachable, either. For example, the <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sed.1.html\">sed man page</a> weighs in at around 1,800 words alone without ever really explaining how <a href=\"https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/\">regular expressions</a> work or the most common uses of sed itself.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself in the same boat, grab a beverage and buckle in. Instead of giving you encyclopedic listings of every possible argument and use case for each of these ubiquitous commands, we're going to teach you how to think <em>about</em> them—and how to easily, productively incorporate them in your own daily command-line use.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788916#p3\">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788916&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5f579591084cc6d7fe2f1fe6734f8b30feef3e7bbcc1706593dc30fb7abb7e58","category":"Tech"}
