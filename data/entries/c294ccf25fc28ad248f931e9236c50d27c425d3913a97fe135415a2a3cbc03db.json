Now you can join Strava Premium as a group for $35 per person, up to four people per “family”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, it’s billed at $139.99 per year, so you’ll need four people on it to maximize the savings. But, since a single Strava Premium account runs $79.99, you’re still saving even if you only have two people on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no restrictions and no catches, you can share it with anyone you want – friends, family, training partners, etc. Actually, there’s one catch: All members of your “family” need to live in the same country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a reminder, Strava Premium gets you the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Goals:</strong> Set weekly goals to chase progress, have fun and keep each other accountable.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Workout Insights:</strong> Easily digestible analysis of activity data for training and chasing progress.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Group Challenges:</strong> Unlimited access to Group Challenges to strive for shared goals.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Routes:</strong> Create, discover, and share routes so it’s even easier to plan trips and group adventures.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Full details at <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/family\" target=\"_blank\">Strava.com/family</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/strava-family-plan/\">Strava Family Plan lets you Clan Up for 50% Off Premium</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"c294ccf25fc28ad248f931e9236c50d27c425d3913a97fe135415a2a3cbc03db","category":"Cycling"}
