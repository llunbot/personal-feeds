Dotted around a region known as the Flemish Ardennes, these are short and steep, and they provide the backdrop for some of the most exciting races in the cycling calendar including the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-flanders-route-riders-sportive-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Flanders</a>, Omloop Het Nieuwsblad and Gent-Wevelgem.</p>\n<p>There are those that are household names such as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/koppenberg-tour-of-flanders\">Koppenberg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/is-the-muur-van-geraardsbergen-flanders-greatest-climb\">Muur van Geraardsbergen</a>, made infamous by the legendary battles that have taken place on their slopes. And then there are those that are slightly less well known, yet in no way easier, such as Ten Bosse and the Boigneberg, </p>\n<p>There are so many great climbs to choose from, but <em>Cyclist</em> has done the hard work for you. Watch the video for a run-down of our top five or read on below for a summary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To reach our final selection, our criteria focussed on the climb’s importance in the world of cycling, how hard it is, how scenic it is and whether it’s enjoyable to ride (if climbing can ever be considered ‘enjoyable’).</p>\n<p>Obviously, we fully expect you’ll wholeheartedly disagree with our selection. With that in mind, we want you to leave a comment under our video with the climbs you would have liked to see included.</p>\n<p>If you fancy not only taking on these five climbs but 59 of the best climbs Flanders has to offer, you should consider the <a href=\"https://www.cyclinginflanders.cc/flandrien-challenge#!\" target=\"_blank\">Flandrien Challenge</a> – 59 climbs, 72 hours and if it’s not on Strava, it didn’t happen. This is genuinely one of the toughest yet most rewarding cycling challenges out there. </p>\n<h2>The top five cobbled climbs in Flanders</h2>\n<h3>1.
