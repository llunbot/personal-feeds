{"title":"AWS and Multicloud: Existing capabilities & continued enhancements","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-and-multicloud-existing-capabilities-continued-enhancements/","date":1722295695000,"content":"<p>When I speak to large-scale AWS customers about their challenges and concerns, the conversation often turns to the topic of multicloud. Whether by intent or by accident, these customers sometimes choose to make use of services from more than one cloud provider, sometimes in conjunction with applications or services that are still hosted on-premises. In some cases they made early, bottom-up choices at the team and division level, choosing cloud offerings from multiple vendors in the absence of a top-down mandate. In others, they acquired or merged with another organization and discovered a similar multi-vendor situation.</p> \n<p>Regardless of the path, these customers tell me that they want to simplify and centralize their oversight and management of this diverse portfolio of cloud and on-premises resources. It is sometimes the case that the “multi” situation is time-bound, with a plan in place to ultimately consolidate operations in one place. It is also sometimes the case that the customer plans to retain their diverse portfolio.</p> \n<p><span><strong>AWS and multicloud</strong></span><br /> Our goal with AWS is to make you successful no matter what architectural choices you have made. In this post I want to outline our approach, share some capabilities that our customers have been using over the years, and provide you with an update on some of the more recent service announcements and content that we have created to give you guidance that will help you to succeed.</p> \n<p>Our approach is to extend existing AWS operational and management capabilities to work in multicloud and hybrid environments. Because we extend existing capabilities, your investment in training, development, scripting, and runbooks is preserved, and actually becomes even more worthwhile since it applies to your other (non-AWS) resources. For example, you can use the same service (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/\">AWS Systems Manager</a>) to patch and update <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)</a> instances, servers running on-premises, and servers provided by other cloud providers. Similarly, you can use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/\">Amazon CloudWatch</a> to monitor applications, compute resources, and other cloud resources in all of those environments. These are two examples of how we are putting our approach into practice for you.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/hybrid-multicloud/\">AWS Solutions for Hybrid and Multicloud</a> page contains additional examples of our extension-based approach to adding new capabilities, along some success stories from customers who have put the capabilities to use including <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/phillips-66-case-study/\">Phillips 66</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/deutsche-borse-config-case-study/\">Deutsche Börse</a>.</p> \n<p>Whether you choose to operate entirely on AWS or in multicloud and hybrid environments, one of the primary reasons to adopt AWS is the broad choice of services we offer, enabling you to innovate, build, deploy, and monitor your workloads. Just as we recently launched <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/free-data-transfer-out-to-internet-when-moving-out-of-aws/\">free data transfer out to the internet</a> (DTO) when you want to move outside of AWS, we are committed to helping you be successful regardless of your approach.</p> \n<p>Now that I have explained our approach and highlighted some of the principal multicloud service offerings, let’s take a look at a few of the newest multicloud and hybrid capabilities.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Multicloud launches</strong></span><br /> Since the beginning of 2023 we have launched eighteen new multicloud capabilities to existing AWS services, including 15 for data &amp; analytics, 1 for security, and 2 for identity. Many of these launches add to the existing multicloud capabilities of the respective services:</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/datasync/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/01/17/datasync_logo_1.png\" width=\"176\" height=\"98\" /></a><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/datasync/\">AWS DataSync</a></strong> – This service transfers data between storage services.
