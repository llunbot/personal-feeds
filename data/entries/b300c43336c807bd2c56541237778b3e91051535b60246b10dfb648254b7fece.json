The news comes as a revision of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/15/kuo-15-inch-m2-macbook-2023-rumor/\">Kuo's previous forecast</a>, which predicted that the 15-inch MacBook Pro could be configurable with either the ‌M2‌ or ‌M2‌ Pro chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe 13-inch ‌MacBook Air‌ with the ‌M2‌ chip that Apple launched last year is available in 8- and 10-core GPU variants, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> model from 2020 was available in 7- and 8-core GPU options. The 15-inch ‌MacBook Air‌ is therefore likely to mirror the 13-inch model in terms of chip specifications.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo also affirmed that the new model will explicitly be branded as a 15-inch ‌MacBook Air‌, rather than a new product line. He expects the device to reach five to six million unit shipments in 2023. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> recently reported that the 15-inch ‌MacBook Air‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/16/new-macbooks-at-wwdc-gurman/\">will be announced at WWDC</a> in June.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/15-inch-macbook-air/\">15-Inch MacBook Air</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/20/kuo-15-inch-macbook-air-two-m2-chip-options/\">Kuo: 15-Inch MacBook Air to Offer Two M2 Chip Options, No M2 Pro Configuration</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-15-inch-macbook-air-to-offer-two-m2-chip-options-no-m2-pro-configuration.2387331/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b300c43336c807bd2c56541237778b3e91051535b60246b10dfb648254b7fece","category":"Apple"}
