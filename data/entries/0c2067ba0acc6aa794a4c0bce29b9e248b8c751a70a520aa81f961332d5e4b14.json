Some of the biggest names available this year include Richard Carapaz, Florian Lipowitz, Olav Kooij, Matej Mohorič, Jasper Stuyven and Fernando Gaviria. After a very busy transfer window last year, the Women’s WorldTour has fewer riders up for grabs at the end of 2025. The headline names on that market are Antonio Niedermaier, Mavi García, Alison Jackson, Silvia Persico and Sarah Van Dam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, no external transfers can be announced until 1st August, so we’re working off a lot of rumours, but contract extensions and development team promotions can be.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Adam Yates extends with UAE Team Emirates XRG</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6-970x647.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-6.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Oman Cycling Association/Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most prized GC assets has been taken off the transfer market with UAE Team Emirates XRG’s extension of Adam Yates. The new contract will see the British rider through with the squad until 2028 alongside Felix Großschartner who also penned a new deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After signing with UAE in 2023, Yates enjoyed one of his best seasons to date, culminating in a Tour de France that saw him finish in third place overall. He’s now a core lieutenant for team leader Tadej Pogačar in the Grand Tours, and as part of the new deal he will likely continue to pilot the team in week-long stage races alongside his customary domestique duties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I’ve felt at home here from day one. The team environment, support staff, and ambition all align perfectly with where I want to be in my career. I’m excited for what the next few years will bring,’ the Mancunian said when the news was announced at the beginning of the month.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+5\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-5-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'the finest writing and photography delivered every month, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-5-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-5-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-5-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-5-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-5-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-5-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-5-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Enric Mas sticks with Movistar until 2029</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-50-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-50-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-50-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-50-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-50-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-50-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-50-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-50-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-50-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-50-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-50.webp 1800w\" /><figcaption>Unipublic/Cxcling/Jose Carlos Diaz</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest GC names on the market this year, Enric Mas, has shut down any speculation of a transfer for 2026. Instead he will stay on Movistar’s roster until 2029.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I’m very grateful for the trust placed in me for the next four years, and I’m truly thrilled. It gives me the motivation to continue growing within this team,’ Mas said. As he points out in the same statement, he will have been with Movistar for a decade once this deal expires, and he’ll also be 34 years old, so consider this a deal that’ll most likely see the rest of his career out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this does mean that <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cyclist-alternative-predictions-2025\">our early-season prediction of Mas moving to Bahrain Victorious</a> hasn’t come to fruition. At least we called an Ineos merger though, right?</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/transfer-market-team-2026\">Drafting the best team with riders out of contract for 2026</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ineos-grenadiers-totalenergies-merger\">Ineos Grenadiers and TotalEnergies partnership: What we know so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-rankings-promotions-and-relegations\">Promotions and relegations update: Which men’s WorldTour teams are in danger in the UCI rankings?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-sponsors\">Who actually are the 2025 WorldTour team sponsors?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: David Gaudu is off the market</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-51.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-51.webp 1800w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-51-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-51-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-51-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-51-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-51-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-51-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-51-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-51-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-51-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Oman Cycling Association/Pauline Ballet</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In a surprising turn of events, David Gaudu has announced this week that he will stay with Groupama-FDJ until 2027.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was previously rumoured that he could be on the move for 2026. Some initial reports had us believing that the Frenchman was in conversation with Picnic-PostNL, perhaps as a replacement for Romain Bardet, who’ll be retiring next month. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Breton’s renewal will continue his collaboration with Groupama-FDJ, after signing with the team as a youngster at the end of the 2010s.

With QuickStep’s managerial ring set to change at the end of this year following the departure of Patrick Lefevere, Evenepoel’s future has been brought into question. Things reached a new fever pitch last week when Riccardo Magrini mentioned on Italian Eurosport that the Olympic champion was in transfer discussions with Ineos Grenadiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A significant deal would need to be struck in order for this to happen. Ineos would likely have to change bike sponsor from Pinarello to Specialized, and with one year left on Evenepoel’s current deal with Soudal-QuickStep, a buyout fee would have to be negotiated. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ineos-grenadiers-totalenergies-merger\">Ineos Grenadiers, who are expected to pen a deal with ‘Big Oil’ firm TotalEnergies</a> in the coming months, may have the finances needed to get this agreement across the line. TotalEnergies-Ineos – if that’s what they’ll be called – is a fitting home for the Belgian if we look back on the squad’s historic record at Grand Tours. On a commercial front, TotalEnergies has also been expanding its business portfolio in Belgium over the past two years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we speculated in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ineos-grenadiers-totalenergies-merger\">our TotalEnergies-Ineos article</a>, rumours of an Evenepoel move were already circulating before these reports came out from the Italian press. Some Belgian journalists have already said that Specialized would be keen to get on board with the deal, given that <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tom-pidcock-q36-5-pros-cons\">Pinarello may switch to Q36.5 Pro Cycling in 2026</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following Evenepoel, some transfer experts have speculated that his domestique Ilan Van Wilder will be following him over.

Continuing their wave of form towards the top half of the UCI points table, the team are linked to Olav Kooij, Cees Bol and Daan Hoole. <em><a href=\"https://www.lequipe.fr/Cyclisme-sur-route/Article/Recrutement-de-benoot-kooij-en-approche-volonte-d-augmenter-ses-moyens-decathlon-passe-la-vitesse-superieure-pour-2026/1562858\" target=\"_blank\">L’Équipe</a></em> echoes those calls, claiming that the French team is willing to stretch its budget for next season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kooij has been rumoured to be on the move for some time now. A couple of years ago he was in negotiations with Picnic-PostNL, before the Dutch team went for Fabio Jakobsen instead. This time around, Kooij has turned to Decathlon-AG2R for support, with the team willing to bring on some serious sprinting support in the form of XDS-Astana rider and former leadout man for Mark Cavendish, Cees Bol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former Giro winner Tom Dumoulin has even been vocal in his support for this rumour, stating that the Dutch sprinter ‘needs to take this deal with both hands’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside this beefed-up sprint train, Tiesj Benoot has also been handed a contract at Decathlon-AG2R.

Currently riding for Arkéa-B&amp;B Hotels, a squad <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-rankings-promotions-and-relegations\">at real risk of relegation</a>, the Frenchman will be a fierce target for some of the strongest WorldTour teams. Proven as a climber, time-triallist and UCI points magnet, he argues a strong case for a big money deal with the sport’s superteams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumours suggest the Norman all-rounder wants to ‘go international’ in 2026, hinting at a move to one of cycling’s big multi-national squads. Currently, Ineos Grenadiers and Lidl-Trek are among the frontrunners for Vauquelin, who finished in second place at this spring’s Flèche Wallonne. If we add in some previous rumours from last year, then Visma-Lease a Bike may also be interested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the British team morphs into TotalEnergies-Ineos the Frenchman may become even more of a target, with some speculating that the squad will switch its licence to a French one as part of the deal. His compatriot Benoît Cosnefroy has also been mentioned in transfer discussions at Ineos as per <em><a href=\"https://www.tuttobiciweb.it/article/1747221493\" target=\"_blank\">Tuttobici’s </a></em>reports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, reports suggest that Decathlon-AG2R are also in the mix for Vauquelin. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rumoured: Dylan van Baarle on the move</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20250412PRX0078-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20250412PRX0078-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20250412PRX0078-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20250412PRX0078-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20250412PRX0078-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20250412PRX0078-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20250412PRX0078-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20250412PRX0078-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20250412PRX0078-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20250412PRX0078-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20250412PRX0078-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Pauline Ballet</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to transfer guru <a href=\"https://dnlbenson.substack.com/p/dylan-van-baarle-set-to-leave-visma\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Benson’s Substack</a>, the 2022 Paris-Roubaix champion Dylan van Baarle will leave Visma-Lease a Bike at the end of 2025, putting an end to a three-year stint with the squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Baarle’s time with Visma-Lease a Bike has been turbulent. He won his first race with the squad back in 2023 at the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, then crashed out of Paris-Roubaix a couple of weeks later. Further Classics results through 2024 and 2025 were poor, but the experienced Dutchman has managed to fill Grand Tour slots as a domestique for the team’s leaders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Baarle’s destination for 2026 is unknown. There are no suggestions as to where he could head at this point, but since he’s at the Giro d’Italia, rumours may pick up steam over the next two weeks. As a guess, a return to Ineos or a move over to a fellow superteam like Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe or Lidl-Trek could be plausible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rumoured: Jasper Stuyven to Soudal-QuickStep</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-52.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-52.webp 1800w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-52-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-52-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-52-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-52-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-52-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-52-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-52-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-52-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Adobe-Express-file-52-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After twelve seasons with Lidl-Trek, Jasper Stuyven is expected to be on the move in 2026.

The farmer’s son from Belgium has been nestled within QuickStep’s set-up for over a decade now, claiming Vuelta and Tour stages during his time with the squad. His results in one-day races, on the other hand, have been somewhat underwhelming in recent years, even if he remains one of QuickStep’s most reliable Classics riders. A change of scenery, therefore, makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the hillier Classics, Quinten Hermans and Xandro Meurisse are mentioned by the Belgian newspaper as transfer objectives for Tom Pidcock’s new home. According to this report, both have already received deals from the team. Although not targeted by Q36.5, their Alpecin-Deceuninck teammate Gianni Vermeersch is expected to pen a deal with Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These signings will help Q36.5 in their quest for a Tour de France invite and a potential WorldTour promotion at the end of the next cycle in 2028. The Swiss team, piloted by former Qhubeka boss Doug Ryder, is rumoured to have a big budget, with support from blue-chip sponsors and South African billionaire Ivan Glasenberg, who also owns shares in Pinarello.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rumoured: Movistar desperately want Juan Ayuso</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1760\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2214763740-scaled.webp\" alt=\"TOPSHOT - UAE Team Emirates XRG's Spanish rider Juan Ayuso celebrates after victory as he crosses the finish of the 7th stage of the 108th Giro d'Italia cycling race 168kms from Castel di Sangro to Tagliacozzo on May 16, 2025.

As the youngster progresses through the ranks, some of his GC targets may end up conflicting with those of GC leader and reigning Tour de France champion Tadej Pogačar. For many, an exit from UAE Team Emirates XRG is a necessity for Ayuso to fulfil his promise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last summer, Movistar approached Ayuso in the wake of his alleged inter-team dispute with UAE Team Emirates at the Tour de France. Speaking at the Giro d’Italia last week, Movistar’s bosses reiterated that Ayuso was a transfer target for them. In a conversation with Italian site <em>Bicisport</em>, on the other hand, former rider Alejandro Valverde confirmed that money was a restricting factor in the stalled talks. Like Evenepoel, a heavy buy-out clause would have to be fronted by Movistar if any deal were to be sealed. So, if money is restricting them, it’s unlikely a move can be made until he officially reaches the end of his contract with UAE in 2028.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rumoured: Stefan Küng to Tudor Pro Cycling</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T140138.640-970x647.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T140138.640-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T140138.640-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T140138.640-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T140138.640-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T140138.640-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T140138.640-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T140138.640-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T140138.640-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T140138.640-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T140138.640.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>Unipublic / Cxcling</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Daniel Benson has said that Stefan Küng will part ways with Groupama-FDJ at the end of the year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Swiss rider was already in some transfer negotiations back in 2022 when his last contract came to an end.

To that end, <a href=\"https://dnlbenson.substack.com/p/transfer-mechanics-99-chance-kung\" target=\"_blank\">Benson believes that there’s a 99% chance </a>of him signing for Tudor Pro Cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Swiss ProTeam have been bolstering their roster in recent seasons, adding in several former WorldTour staples like Julian Alaphilippe, Matteo Trentin and Marc Hirschi. As part of the squad, which will make its Tour de France debut this summer, Küng would steady their Classics contingent alongside the aforementioned Trentin as well as Marco Haller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Curious where the money for these big contracts comes from?
