The Choose Europe for Science program, backed with more than half a billion dollars, is designed to offer an alternative to researchers who have been <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-chaos-of-nih-cuts-has-left-early-career-scientists-scrambling/\">forced to seek new opportunities</a> following <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/life-saving-research-risks-being-destroyed-by-the-federal-funding-freeze/\">cuts in scientific funding</a> imposed by <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/donald-trump/\">President Donald Trump’s</a> administration.</p>\n<p>The program will invest €500 million ($568 million) between 2025 and 2027 to recruit specialists in various fields of knowledge to come and work in Europe. The initiative also includes a target for member states to allocate 3 percent of their GDP to R&amp;D projects by 2030.</p>\n<p>“The role of science in today’s world is questioned,” warned Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/da/speech_25_1130\">statement</a> on Tuesday. “What a gigantic miscalculation. I believe that science holds the key to our future here in Europe. Without it, we simply cannot address today’s global challenges—from health to new tech, from climate to oceans.”</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/europe-launches-program-to-lure-scientists-away-from-the-us/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/europe-launches-program-to-lure-scientists-away-from-the-us/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"40027d0a804be2112485e99938666b05d75769cfb2f10a72d6cf0f829f2db9f8","category":"Tech"}
