It found that the iPad itself has one big improvement in repairability over its predecessor but that the Apple Pencil Pro is basically unserviceable.</p>\n<p>The first step in the teardown video revealed arguably Apple's most interesting new tech: the \"Tandem OLED\" screen. It doesn't reveal anything we didn't already know and describe in our review last week, but it's neat to see what it all looks like up close.</p>\n<p>The teardown also found that there are not one but two metal brackets all the way through the middle of the iPad to help with durability. Some worried that the new, thinner iPad Pro would be thinner than past models to snap in half, but durability tests have shown that's not the case. This could be part of why.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025552#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025552&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2f5ce73ce1913671572bf14ab0a3d728239295cf79185b067a9821e37da7547b","category":"Tech"}
