The component would replace the current touch/waveform interface, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/future-homepod-to-add-curved-lcd-display/\">in the past</a>, Kosutami has suggested that the LCD display is slightly curved.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>New picture of the (might be upcoming one) HomePod with display. <br />Glossy, sick, just imagine.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Apple</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/appleinternal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#appleinternal</a> (B720) <a href=\"https://t.co/xMTULXpGw0\">pic.twitter.com/xMTULXpGw0</a></p>— Kosutami (@Kosutami_Ito) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1781048272972575199?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 18, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nThere have been rumors about a ‌HomePod‌ with a display since 2021, and Apple actually seems to have several products in the works. The simplest is the ‌HomePod‌ that Kosutami and other leakers have referenced, which seems to be just a traditional speaker with a glass touchscreen. The display will show information from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> like the song that's playing, and it will allow for SharePlay and other features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> has said that Apple is working on a ‌HomePod‌ speaker with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/homepod-with-ipad-like-screen-2025-rumor/\">an iPad-like display</a> and a built-in camera, and also a ‌HomePod‌ with a screen <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/homepod-ipad-with-robotic-arm/\">mounted on a robotic arm</a>. Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/homepod-with-7-inch-display-to-launch-in-2024/\">said in 2023</a> that Apple would release a ‌HomePod‌ with a 7-inch display at some point in 2024, though it doesn't look like that's happening at this point.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's not really clear when we're going to see a refreshed ‌HomePod‌ at all, and it's possible that Apple is still just experimenting with a variety of designs. That said, the ‌HomePod‌ with a touch-responsive LCD display that uses the same design we have today does not seem farfetched, and it's plausible that such a product could come in the not too distant future.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/18/alleged-homepod-display-component/\">Alleged HomePod Display Component Again Shown Off in Photo</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/alleged-homepod-display-component-again-shown-off-in-photo.2424460/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6c578ce974efec3fe8c8fc561761fc43a5a3fd34347a3eb2c7cf549460739883","category":"Apple"}
