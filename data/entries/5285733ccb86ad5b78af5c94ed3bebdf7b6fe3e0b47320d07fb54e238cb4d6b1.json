The releases include iOS 15.2 and iPadOS 15.2, macOS Monterey 12.1, watchOS 8.3, and tvOS 15.2</p>\n<p>All of these are now publicly available on supported devices. All but tvOS are x.x feature updates, meaning that they actually add new features instead of just fixing issues.</p>\n<p>Depending on the OS, those features may include SharePlay, Apple Music Voice Plan, the App Privacy Report panel, and more.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818662#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818662&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5285733ccb86ad5b78af5c94ed3bebdf7b6fe3e0b47320d07fb54e238cb4d6b1","category":"Tech"}
