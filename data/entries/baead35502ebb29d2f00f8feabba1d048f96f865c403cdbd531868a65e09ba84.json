Apple says that it can tailor the noise control as you move between different environments and interactions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/f-c48f85c666086c80ac648bbe43ed71a680e8d64d.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"894\" />\r<br />\nThis way, loud or distracting noises surrounding you will be automatically reduced, while other noises will still be audible. Apple gave the example of leaf blowers getting reduced but sudden traffic noises coming through on the user's AirPods.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Conversation Awareness</h2>\r<br />\nConversation Awareness is able to detect when someone starts talking to you, and will lower the volume of the audio you're listening to and cut down on background noise accordingly. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/airpods-pro-conversation-boost.jpg\" alt width=\"3570\" height=\"2000\" />\r<br />\nConversation Awareness helps when you're on a call as well, reducing noise around you while you speak. As a sub-component of Adaptive Audio, this feature also enhances the voices in front of you so you can hear what's going on.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Personalized Volume</h2>\r<br />\nSimilar to Adaptive Audio, Personalized Volume uses machine learning to fine-tune your listening experience by understanding environmental conditions and listening preferences. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/10/airpods-pro-person.jpg\" alt width=\"816\" height=\"544\" />\r<br />\nThanks to this feature, your ‌‌iPhone‌‌ is able to learn more about the volume that you prefer over time, and will tweak it as necessary to match your desired sound level.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Mute Controls</h2>\r<br />\nPerhaps surprisingly, ‌AirPods Pro‌ do not currently have an assignable on-board mute function. With ‌iOS 17‌, however, that's set to change. If you press the stem of your ‌‌AirPods Pro‌‌ earbuds, you will be able to mute and unmute yourself while you're on a call. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/airpods-pro-2-mute.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nFirst-generation AirPods and third-generation AirPods also support this feature, and it also works on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a> headphones if you press the Digital Crown.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Fast Automatic Device Switching</h2>\r<br />\nAirPods have been criticized in the past for sluggish performance when attempting to automatically switch between Apple devices. Fortunately, ‌‌AirPods Pro‌‌ 2 will automatically switch between Apple devices much quicker in ‌‌iOS 17‌‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Hey Siri</h2>\r<br />\nThis fall, Apple is simplifying the voice command to invoke <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> on the ‌iPhone‌ and other Apple devices, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, Mac, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>, and the second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Hey-Siri-vs-Siri.jpeg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"894\" />\r<br />\nInstead of \"Hey ‌Siri‌,\" you'll be able to simply say \"‌Siri‌\" to activate the voice assistant when wearing your AirPods. Not only that, you'll also be able to issue multiple queries and commands in succession without having to say \"‌Siri‌\" again.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Read More</h2>\r<br />\nApple is expected to release ‌iOS 17‌ alongside firmware updates for AirPods in September 2023.
