Now it’s known for paying out cash to its users in the U.S. Apple has reached a settlement in a class action lawsuit, agreeing to a fund of $35 million to be paid out to owners of the iPhone 7.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lawsuit (Tabak, et al. v. Apple Inc., Case No. 4:19-cv-02455; United States District Court for the Northern District of California) alleged that the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus had problems with its audio IC chip, which caused audio issues. As part of the settlement, Apple denies any wrongdoing or that the phones had such issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://smartphoneaudiosettlement.com/home&amp;xcust=1-1-2211267-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">settlement website</a>, iPhone 7 owners who are entitled to a payment must be part of the “Settlement Class,” which means you either made a complaint to Apple about the iPhone 7 audio, or you paid Apple for a replacement or repair that is covered by the settlement. You can <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://smartphoneaudiosettlement.com/faqs?id=5&amp;xcust=1-1-2211267-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">check an FAQ</a> to see if you qualify.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you paid Apple for a replacement or repair, you will receive at least $50 or up to $349. If you complained to Apple but did not pay Apple for a replacement or repair, you could get $125.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emails and postcards are being sent to those who qualify for payment. A response is required by June 3, 2024, if you wish to receive payment, which will be distributed by electronic check, ACH transfer, or physical check. An email address, banking information, or mailing address must be provided for the payment’s distribution. Anyone who has received a notice can submit their information on the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://smartphoneaudiosettlement.com/select-payment&amp;xcust=1-1-2211267-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Select Payment website</a> for the settlement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This settlement comes over three years after a class action lawsuit was made involving the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233892/if-you-have-an-iphone-6-or-7-apple-owes-you-some-cash.html\">slowing down</a> of the iPhone 7, as well as the iPhone 6 and iPhone SE (1st gen). That lawsuit resulted in Apple creating a $500 million settlement fund that paid out $25 to each owner of the iPhones involved.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"69af87472553a1ed84996d3188cc9528c2810b7a14e79423b84a004225e77f3f","category":"Apple"}
