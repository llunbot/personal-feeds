That means prioritizing cancer patients who have a shot at being cured over patients at later stages, in whom the drugs may simply slow progression and buy time. Still, those with curable cancers may not get a full dose; some may only have 80 percent or 60 percent of standard doses available to them. And doctors don't know how these partial doses will affect patient outcomes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1949404#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1949404&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4b561ce8f15ac50e543ff569964f289be5548aa18ab81b97b21f6c3704b9407e","category":"Tech"}
