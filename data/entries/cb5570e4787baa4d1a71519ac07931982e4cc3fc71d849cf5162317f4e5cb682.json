Read on for the lowdown on all the new features and further improvements coming later in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sonoma: Release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The final version of macOS 14 will be released to the general public on <strong>Tuesday, September 26</strong>, this is earlier than other recent releases. In the recent past, the release has come several weeks after the new version of iOS ships:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>macOS 14 Sonoma:</strong> September 26, 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>macOS 13 Ventura:</strong> October 24, 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>macOS 12 Monterey:</strong> October 25, 2021</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>macOS 11 Big Sur:</strong> November 12, 2020</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>macOS 10.15 Catalina:</strong> October 7, 2019</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>macOS 10.14 Mojave:</strong> September 24, 2018</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What time will Sonoma launch? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that macOS Sonoma will arrive today, but those keen to update will want to know exactly how long they will have to wait.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>macOS Sonoma will most likely arrive at around 10 am PT, 1 pm ET, and 6 pm BST on Tuesday, September 26. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how that translates in the countries where most of our readers live: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>U.S.: at 10 am (PST/PDT), 11 am (MST/MDT), noon (CST/CDT), 1 pm (EST/EDT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Canada: as above, and 2 pm (AST/ADT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>U.K.: at 6 pm (GMT/BST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Europe: at 7 pm (CET/CEST), 8 pm (EEST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>India: at 10.30 pm (IST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Australia: Following day at 1 am (AWST/AWDT), 2.30 am (ACST/ACDT), 3 am (AEST/AEDT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New Zealand: next day at 5 am (NZST/NZDT)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to install macOS Sonoma </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We cover <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671172/how-to-update-macos.html\">how to install macOS Sonoma</a> in a separate article that covers some of the issues you might encounter during the process, so if you do have any difficulties check out that article. It should be simple enough to install macOS Sonoma though. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Go to System Settings (System Preferences in older versions of macOS). </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on General. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on Software Update and your Mac will search for the update. If it’s the day that Sonoma arrives, you may have to wait a while before it shows up. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on Upgrade Now and wait for the macOS installer to download. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once the installer has downloaded click on Install and wait while the software is installed on your Mac (during which time you won’t be able to use the Mac.)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sonoma Beta: latest version</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even after macOS Sonoma arrives, Apple will continue testing a developer version and a public version of the beta. This is how Apple will test new features that will arrive later in 2023 and in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest beta of Sonoma is the Release Candidate, which arrived on September 12.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the full version of macOS 14 Sonoma arrives Apple will start work on macOS 14.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>June 5:</strong> macOS 14 is revealed and the developer beta is released.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>J<strong>une 21: </strong>Apple releases second developer beta. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>July 5: </strong>Apple releases third developer beta. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>July 12:</strong> Apple released the first public beta.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>July 25</strong>: Apple released the fourth developer beta. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>July 31</strong>: Apple releases its second public beta and a revised version of the fourth developer beta (following prior installation difficulties).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>August 8</strong>: Developer beta 5 is released. Public beta 3 is released. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>August 22:</strong> Developer beta 6 is released. Public beta 4 released.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>August 30</strong>: Developer beta 7 is released. Public beta 5 is released.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>September 12</strong>: The Release Candidate 1 arrives. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>September 26</strong>: Full version of macOS Sonoma available.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>June to September/October:</strong> This is the beta testing period. Apple will release several beta updates during this time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>September/October:</strong> macOS 14 is released to the general public.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sonoma: How to install and remove the beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a beta tester you may want to stop receiving beta updates once the full version of Sonoma arrives. In this case you can go to Software Updates, click on the (i) beside Beta updates, and turn them off–that way you shouldn’t receive any more beta versions of the software and will be able to update to the full version of macOS 14. This process is a little more complicated if you want to downgrade from the iOS 17 beta to iOS 16, or from a subsequent beta of iOS 17 to the original version. If you then want to uninstall the beta, we have a guide for that: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673127/how-to-remove-macos-beta-from-a-mac.html\">How to remove macOS Sonoma beta</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven’t been part of the beta but want to join, installing the beta is simple, especially since Apple changed the beta process in macOS 13.4. It used to be necessary to download the Beta Access Utility for every device, but now you only need to register your Apple ID for the beta program to install betas on every Apple device that is signed into that account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then when you go to Software Update, you’ll see a new tab for <em>Beta Updates</em>, which will list the beta versions that are available to you. If you want to install the public beta, select <em>macOS 14 Public Beta</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just remember: betas are not as stable as the official version–features may be implemented and then withdrawn, or they may not work properly, UI can change, and third-party app compatibility isn’t guaranteed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to install the beta, follow our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671123/how-to-install-macos-beta.html\">macOS beta installation guide</a>.

Some new features may also require Apple chips and not run on Intel-based Macs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out which version of macOS older Macs can run take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673697/what-version-of-macos-can-my-mac-run.html\">macOS compatibility list</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sonoma features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a summary of the top new features coming in macOS 14.

In Sonoma you will be able to pick more Widgets from the Widget Gallery and place them anywhere on the screen. Apple has gone to lengths to make sure they aren’t distracting, they will essentially fade into the background.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will even be able to add Widgets from an iPhone using Continuity.; the iPhone just needs to be nearby, on or same Wi-Fi network.

It’s a bit like the screensavers on the Apple TV, we think. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2048287/macos-sonoma-cityscape-underwater-earth-animated-wallpapers.html\">These gorgeous wallpapers are the best reason to upgrade to macOS Sonoma.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Personal Voice </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A new Personal Voice feature will allow you to train your Mac to talk with your voice and then use that to convert text to speech. We explain how to use it here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2050750/how-to-make-your-mac-talk-like-you-macos-sonoma.html\">macOS Sonoma: How to train your Mac to talk in your voice</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Game Mode </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This new mode will ensure the game gets the highest priority on GPU and CPU, which should help with playability. It will, Apple says, make gaming on Mac “more immersive.” There are also changes that should reduce latency with controllers and improve in-game responsiveness. These sound like improvements that could help improve gaming on the Mac, but it may just be too little too late. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple announced that there are more Mac games coming, and demonstrated “Death Stranding: Directors Cut” (which is unfortunately not a new game). Apple also explained how it will help game developers bring their games to the Mac with a new Game Porting kit that includes tools that devs can use to quickly port their games to the Mac, significantly reducing the game development time. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1945978/game-porting-toolkit-gaming-mac-valve-proton.html\">Apple’s Game Porting Toolkit is the first real step to fixing Mac gaming.</a> We also explain <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1993906/how-to-game-mode-macos-14-sonoma.html\">How to use Game Mode to boost performance.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Video Conferencing features</h3>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"macOS Sonoma Meeting presentation\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /><figcaption>You will appear in front of your presentation.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple described how when you share your screen during a presentation your presence can get lost. To fix this issue Apple has devised a new video effect called Presenter Overlay which will overlay your face over the presentation, separating you from the background. This can appear like the picture above, or be a smaller bubble with your face in (which may cover less of the presentation). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other new features include the ability to add a reaction to your video to show how you feel about something. For example, if you show two thumbs up a fireworks animation will play. These features can also be used as video effects with other video conferencing apps, so it’s not tied to FaceTime. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Safari </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>More updates are coming to WebKit, including new typography. Private browsing will get a new feature that will block private browsing windows when you aren’t using them. It will be possible to share Passkeys and Passwords with family members, This will be end-to-end encrypted via iCloud Keychain. You will be able to create Safari Profiles so you can separate accounts between work and home/school profiles, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2012427/safari-17-features-web-apps-profiles-private-favorites-widget-extensions.html\">Safari 17: All the new features coming to your Mac this fall</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Web Apps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be easy to make a website you use a lot into a Web App. Just open the webpage and choose File &gt; Add to Dock to add a webpage to the Dock as an icon and open it to get an app-like appearance for that web page that opens outside of Safari.  <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1984619/macos-sonoma-how-to-web-apps.html\">Learn how to make and manage Web Apps in macOS Sonoma</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>PDFs and Notes </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AutoFill will make it easy to fill out PDFs faster and securely. You will also be able to view PDFs in Notes, link related notes, and open a Note in Pages to update it there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The AutoFill for PDFs is a feature coming later in 2023. </em></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Web Apps in macOS Sonoma\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Keyboard </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Changes to the keyboard will include improved Autocorrect and typing predictions. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Messages </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can expect improved Search of the Messages app, being able to refine your search as you go. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will also be warnings about potentially sensitive videos and photos before you open them. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Security</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Improvements to Lockdown Mode will help protect against cyber attacks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other new features include <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2044274/ios-17-how-to-play-daily-crosswords-apple-news.html\">daily crosswords with Apple News+</a>.</p>\n\nMacOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"cb5570e4787baa4d1a71519ac07931982e4cc3fc71d849cf5162317f4e5cb682","category":"Apple"}
