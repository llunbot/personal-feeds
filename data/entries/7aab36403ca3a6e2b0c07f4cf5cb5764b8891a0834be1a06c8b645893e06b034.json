A Massachusetts government <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/news/massachusetts-state-911-department-determined-firewall-caused-statewide-911-disruption\">press release</a> issued yesterday said the state's 911 vendor, Comtech, \"has advised State 911 that they have applied a technical solution to ensure that this does not happen again.\"</p>\n<p>\"A preliminary investigation conducted by the State 911 Department and Comtech determined that the outage was the result of a firewall, a safety feature that provides protection against cyberattacks and hacking,\" the announcement said. \"The firewall prevented calls from getting to the 911 dispatch centers, also known as Public Safety Answer Points (PSAPs).\"</p>\n<p>Comtech's initial review \"confirmed that the interruption was not the result of a cyberattack or hack,\" but \"the exact reason the firewall stopped calls from reaching dispatch centers remains under review,\" the state said.
