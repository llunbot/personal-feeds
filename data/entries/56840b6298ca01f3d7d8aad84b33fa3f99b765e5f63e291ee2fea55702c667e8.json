It consists of the Washburn, a gravel tire with a slick center section, and the Rampart, a slick tire they brand specifically as an ‘allroad’ tire. Their dirt-centric formula has worked well for the company, even if their current lineup was missing something for folks who prefer pavement.</span></p>\n<p><span>Now comes the Teravail Telegraph tire, which the company unabashedly calls a “performance road tire.” </span></p>\n<p><span>Teravail’s Telegraph tire is a focused lineup, with just two tire sizes, two casing construction options, and two sidewall colors. We had a fair bit of time riding the Telegraph tire in both ‘Light &amp; Supple’ and ‘Durable’ casings prior to its release, revealing a tire that excelled just about everywhere, even if it didn’t stand out in one particular place.</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Teravail-Telegraph-tire-review-light-supple-tan-wall-box.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Teravail-Telegraph-tire-review---light-supple-tan-wall-box\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Teravail-Telegraph-tire-review-light-supple-tan-wall-box.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Teravail-Telegraph-tire-review-light-supple-tan-wall-box.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption>Out of the box, the Telegraph boasts a fairly pliable sidewall. You can feel the difference in the stiffness in the tread between Light &amp; Supple and Durable tires, however.</figcaption></figure>\n<h2><span>What’s in a Telegraph?</span></h2>\n<p><span>The number of decent road tires in the 30 mm tire size is slowly growing, between the </span><a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2022/07/vittorias-new-corsa-n-ext-tire-review-the-classic-corsa-now-in-nylon/\"><span>Vittoria Corsa N.EXT</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2021/10/continental-grand-prix-5000-s-tr-tubeless-road-clincher-officially-announced/\"><span>Grand Prix 5000 S TR</span></a><span> and recently announced Grand Prix All Season TR, Schwalbe Pro ONE among others. </span></p>\n<p><span>The Telegraph follows in a long line of Teravail tires that come in two casing constructions: a lighter version called Light &amp; Supple and another called Durable. Both are essentially the same casing, though the Durable casing incorporates a belt of woven aramid fiber reinforcement at between the tread and the inside of the tire.</span></p>\n<p><span>The casing itself is relatively supple for a tubeless-ready tire, with plenty of pliability in the hand. Teravail says it is a 120 TPI casing that is new for the company with the aim of taking the durability and longevity they’ve aimed for in the high-volume gravel and allroad space, but with a more responsive ride feel</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Teravail-Telegraph-tire-review-light-supple-tan-wall-label.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Teravail-Telegraph-tire-review---light-supple-tan-wall-label\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Teravail-Telegraph-tire-review-light-supple-tan-wall-label.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Teravail-Telegraph-tire-review-light-supple-tan-wall-label.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption>Could be an early production thing, but the print of the logo doesn’t seem to *completely* follow the arc of the tire and rim. Nonetheless, the tire seems very well constructed otherwise and held air well enough without sealant.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span>Outside is a relatively smooth tread with light boomerang-shaped siping on the sides of the tire. Teravail could’ve left the tire completely slick with no change in performance, but the extra little boomerangs are a nice visual touch.</span></p>\n<p><span>My Teravail Telegraph 30 mm tires weighed in at an average of 330 grams each for the Light &amp; Supple in Tan. The 30 mm Durable casing with a Black sidewall weighed 365 grams each. Teravail does not list a suggested weight, but these are roughly on par with claimed weights from more durable road tires.</span></p>\n<p><span>These 30 mm labeled tires measured 29.8 mm with a 20 mm internal width and 31.1 mm on a 25 mm road rim. </span></p>\n<h2><span>Telegraph riding impressions</span></h2>\n<p><span>I am of the opinion that for a majority of riders, a 28 mm tire is the absolute minimum tire they should be on. But for folks who are willing to trade a touch of pace for a whole lot more comfort, a 30 mm tire is a great choice that still fits a majority of even the most race-oriented road bikes. The Telegraph fits right into that.</span></p>\n<p><span>Installing the Telegraph was fairly straightforward. Both tire options seated with a floor pump with a little bit of massaging, and both held air easily with about 50 mL (2 fl oz) of sealant on both a hookless rim with a 25 mm internal and a hooked rim with a 20 mm internal.</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Teravail-Telegraph-tire-review-light-supple-tan-wall-inflation.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Teravail-Telegraph-tire-review---light-supple-tan-wall-inflation\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Teravail-Telegraph-tire-review-light-supple-tan-wall-inflation.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Teravail-Telegraph-tire-review-light-supple-tan-wall-inflation.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption>Teravail recommends keeping the Telegraph between 50 and 70 PSI. I preferred riding the LIght &amp; Supple tires at 54/57 PSI front and rear as a 130 lb (58 kg) rider.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span>As mentioned, there are two versions of the Telegraph. I was able to ride both options and found they were surprisingly similar in ride feel at higher pressures. Both roll smoothly, though the Light &amp; Supple option of course offers a slightly smoother ride experience at the same tire pressure. </span></p>\n<p><span>Additionally, both offer excellent dry grip. That kind of dry grip – along with the knowledge of having a wider 30 mm tire to back up that grip – adds a whole lot of confidence to really push it through descents. And importantly in a relatively flat central Texas, I felt more confident pushing through corners that seemed dusted over than I would on my normal road tire.</span></p>\n<p><span>Perhaps that’s a placebo, but the tires never let go. I’ll take it.</span></p>\n<p><span>The differences between the two tires really started to show as you dropped pressures down further. I preferred the Light &amp; Supple tire a bit more at lower pressures because they seemed to spin up quite a bit quicker than the Durable option, whereas it felt like the rolling resistance ramped up considerably the more I let out the tire pressure.</span></p>\n<figure>\n<p></p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Teravail-Telegraph-tire-review-light-supple-tan-wall-tread-1.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Teravail-Telegraph-tire-review---light-supple-tan-wall-tread-1\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Teravail-Telegraph-tire-review-light-supple-tan-wall-tread-1.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Teravail-Telegraph-tire-review-light-supple-tan-wall-tread-1.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption>Slick tires don’t really need tread on the side, but it sure does look cool.</figcaption></figure></figure>\n<figure></figure>\n<p><span>If I were to choose a tire for myself, I’d go with the Light &amp; Supple version. Though both roll smoothly, the Light &amp; Supple option was slightly better, and felt more willing to get up to speed around a corner or in a sprint. </span></p>\n<p><span>How does the Teravail Telegraph compare to the competition? </span></p>\n<p><span>I don’t have much experience on wider 30 to 34 mm slick tires, but compared to the Continental Grand Prix 5000 or Pirelli P Zero Race TLR in a 28 mm width, the Telegraph compares well. Neither casing is as fast as those options, but frankly, I didn’t expect the Telegraph to be faster anyways. Those tires feel just a bit zippier and more willing to get up to speed, but again, neither is in a 30 mm width.</span></p>\n<figure>\n<p></p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Teravail-Telegraph-tire-review-light-supple-tan-wall-box-with-black-sidewall.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Teravail-Telegraph-tire-review---light-supple-tan-wall-box-with-black-sidewall\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Teravail-Telegraph-tire-review-light-supple-tan-wall-box-with-black-sidewall.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Teravail-Telegraph-tire-review-light-supple-tan-wall-box-with-black-sidewall.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption>Pictured in tan is the Telegraph 30mm tire in tan and Light &amp; Supple. In the box is the Durable version with a black sidewall.</figcaption></figure></figure>\n<h2><span>Conclusion</span></h2>\n<p><span>I came away surprised by the Teravail Telegraph. The tire doesn’t stand out in any one way, but it rolls well, it inspires quite a bit of cornering confidence, and it was a tire I didn’t have to think too seriously about. Teravail says the Telegraph price is “starting at $70;” if that’s the case, then the price undercuts a number of other options, making the tire a much more compelling option.</span></p>\n<p><span>What was more impressive was that I was happily riding 30 mm tires on my road bike. I didn’t feel any slower and I definitely felt more confident rolling down chip-seal roads. And for the first time, the wider tire width made me want to grab the road bike with wider tires rather than the narrower tires I perceived to feel faster.</span></p>\n<p><span>So while the Teravail Telegraph may not stand out in any particular way, it made me a believer in wide road tires. I suspect it will do the same for you. </span></p>\n<p><span>Price: undetermined, but “starting at $70” / </span>€ NA</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://teravail.com\" target=\"_blank\">teravail.com</a></p>\n<figure></figure>","author":"Alvin Holbrook","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"56840b6298ca01f3d7d8aad84b33fa3f99b765e5f63e291ee2fea55702c667e8","category":"Cycling"}
