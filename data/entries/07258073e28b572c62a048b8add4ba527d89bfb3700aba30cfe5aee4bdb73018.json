The pricing changes will go into effect in the next few days.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/app-store-blue-banner.jpg\" /><blockquote>When taxes or foreign exchange rates change, we sometimes need to update prices on the App Store in certain regions and/or adjust your proceeds.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the next few days, prices of apps and in-app purchases (excluding auto-renewable subscriptions) on the App Store will increase in Turkey. Your proceeds will be adjusted accordingly and will be calculated based on the tax-exclusive price.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOnce these changes go into effect, the Pricing and Availability section of My Apps will be updated. You can change the price of your apps and in-app purchases (including auto-renewable subscriptions) at any time in App Store Connect. If you offer subscriptions, you can choose to preserve prices for existing subscribers.</blockquote>Tier 1 apps in the country will now be priced starting at 16.99 lira, up from the 10.99 price that was set in October when Apple first raised its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> pricing in Turkey. 16.99 is equivalent to approximately $1.24 at the current time.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple in late November <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/23/apple-store-turkey-sales-halted/\">temporarily halted sales of devices</a> in Turkey with the deepening of the country's economic crisis. Apple's online store in the country stopped allowing customers to make purchases, as did <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/24/apple-customers-turkey-turned-away/\">some retail locations</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/26/apple-sales-return-to-turkey-price-hike/\">resumed sales in Turkey</a> a few days after the pause, introducing significant price increases. An <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>, for example, is priced at 14.999 TL, up from the original 11.999 TL price before the hike.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe value of the Turkish lira has seen a significant drop over the course of the last few weeks, continuing a trend that began last year. A Turkish lira is now equivalent to approximately 0.073 U.S. dollars.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/turkey/\">Turkey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/app-store-pricing-increase-turkey/\">Apple Increasing App Store Prices in Turkey Amid Continued Economic Instability</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-increasing-app-store-prices-in-turkey-amid-continued-economic-instability.2326746/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=aLCwby8-o5c:bNuHqm3MX_c:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=aLCwby8-o5c:bNuHqm3MX_c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"07258073e28b572c62a048b8add4ba527d89bfb3700aba30cfe5aee4bdb73018","category":"Apple"}
