Maintaining 36mm stanchions, the updates are said to increase the fork’s torsional stiffness, sensitivity and overall reliability. The HDRV damper cartridge remains unchanged, while the air spring receives some additional cushioning at top-out and bottom-out. Here are the finer details of the EXT ERA V2.</p><h2>EXT ERA V2</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112659/EXT-ERA-V2-ENDURO-MOUNTAIN-BIKE-FORK.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112659/EXT-ERA-V2-ENDURO-MOUNTAIN-BIKE-FORK.jpg\" alt=\"EXT ERA V2\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112659/EXT-ERA-V2-ENDURO-MOUNTAIN-BIKE-FORK.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112659/EXT-ERA-V2-ENDURO-MOUNTAIN-BIKE-FORK-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112659/EXT-ERA-V2-ENDURO-MOUNTAIN-BIKE-FORK-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112659/EXT-ERA-V2-ENDURO-MOUNTAIN-BIKE-FORK-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112659/EXT-ERA-V2-ENDURO-MOUNTAIN-BIKE-FORK-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112659/EXT-ERA-V2-ENDURO-MOUNTAIN-BIKE-FORK-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>As the EXT ERA enters its 2nd generation, the brand has looked to improve the stiffness, reliability and sensitivity of their one and only mountain bike fork. The single-crown ERA V2 gets new magnesium lowers now sporting a floating axle, a feature that serves to keep the fork in its true alignment despite potential hub spacing discrepancies. This decoupling is said to improve the fork’s sensitivity, enhancing overall performance.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112705/EXT-ERA-V2-FLOATING-AXLE.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112705/EXT-ERA-V2-FLOATING-AXLE.jpg\" alt=\"ext era v2 floating axle\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112705/EXT-ERA-V2-FLOATING-AXLE.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112705/EXT-ERA-V2-FLOATING-AXLE-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112705/EXT-ERA-V2-FLOATING-AXLE-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112705/EXT-ERA-V2-FLOATING-AXLE-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112705/EXT-ERA-V2-FLOATING-AXLE-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112705/EXT-ERA-V2-FLOATING-AXLE-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The ERA V2 retains the unique multi-faceted steerer tube-crown interface designed in partnership with Chris Porter of Mojo Rising. Thus, stiffness in the fore-aft plane is unchanged in this new iteration, but the new magnesium lowers are said to increase the torsional stiffness of the fork. This comes with no tangible change in overall weight; the ERA V2 is actually 5g lighter than the original at a claimed 2275g (170mm, 29″).</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112708/EXT-ERA-V2-FORK-MAGNESIUM-LOWERS.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112708/EXT-ERA-V2-FORK-MAGNESIUM-LOWERS.jpg\" alt=\"EXT ERA V2 FORK MTB ENDURO SUSPENSION\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112708/EXT-ERA-V2-FORK-MAGNESIUM-LOWERS.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112708/EXT-ERA-V2-FORK-MAGNESIUM-LOWERS-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112708/EXT-ERA-V2-FORK-MAGNESIUM-LOWERS-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112708/EXT-ERA-V2-FORK-MAGNESIUM-LOWERS-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112708/EXT-ERA-V2-FORK-MAGNESIUM-LOWERS-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24112708/EXT-ERA-V2-FORK-MAGNESIUM-LOWERS-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>Whereas the lowers of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/extreme-shox-usher-in-new-era-fork-tech-w-new-ext-era-hs3-hybrid-coil-air-spring/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">original EXT ERA</a> looked remarkably similar to those of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ib17-x-fusion-goes-big-trace-36-long-travel-29er-suspension-fork/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">X-Fusion Trace</a>, the ERA V2 is a departure from that aesthetic with subtle changes to the detail at the crown, as well as the addition of the floating axle.

First up, the inside face features small dimples – these serve to trap oil between the bush and the stanchion, improving lubrication. On the external face of the DU Bush you’ll notice a partial cut-out that runs its full length. This channel allows oil from the bottom part of the lowers to be pumped upwards to the upper DU Bush as the fork is cycled through compression and rebound phases. EXT produced the following video to show the DU Bush in action.</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEnZu-DJcms?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><h3>Can I upgrade my EXT ERA V1?</h3><p>Yes!
