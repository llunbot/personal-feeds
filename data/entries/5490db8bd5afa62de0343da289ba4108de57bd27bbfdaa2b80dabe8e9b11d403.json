The company plans to incorporate a partner company’s AI tech into its TV software in order to interpret psychological factors impacting a viewer, such as personal interests, personality traits, and lifestyle choices. The aim is to show LG webOS users ads that will emotionally impact them.</p>\n<p>The upcoming advertising approach comes via a multi-year licensing deal with Zenapse, a company <a href=\"https://www.zenapse.com/\">describing itself</a> as a software-as-a-service marketing platform that can drive advertiser sales “with AI-powered emotional intelligence.” LG will use Zenapse’s technology to divide webOS users into hyper-specific market segments that are supposed to be more informative to advertisers. LG Ad Solutions, LG’s advertising business, announced the partnership on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The technology will be used to inform ads shown on LG smart TVs’ homescreens, free ad-supported TV (FAST) channels, and elsewhere throughout webOS, per <a href=\"https://www.streamtvinsider.com/advertising/lg-brings-emotionally-aware-targeted-advertising-ctv-zenapse\">StreamTV Insider</a>. LG will also use Zenapse's tech to “expand new software development and go-to-market products,\" it said. LG didn’t specify the duration of its licensing deal with Zenapse.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/lg-tvs-integrated-ads-get-more-personal-with-tech-that-analyzes-viewer-emotions/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/lg-tvs-integrated-ads-get-more-personal-with-tech-that-analyzes-viewer-emotions/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5490db8bd5afa62de0343da289ba4108de57bd27bbfdaa2b80dabe8e9b11d403","category":"Tech"}
