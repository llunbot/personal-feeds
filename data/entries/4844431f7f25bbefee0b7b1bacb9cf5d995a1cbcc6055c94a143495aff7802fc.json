Yesterday we covered the theory that the iPhone 17 Air, if successful, will be followed by <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2638996/successful-iphone-17-air-could-lead-to-portless-and-folding-iphones-from-2026.html\">folding (and portless) iPhones</a> starting next year. And on the same day, analysts claimed a foldable MacBook-iPad hybrid is in the works on a similar timeframe. After years of standing on the sidelines, Apple seems finally to be ready to join this much-hyped market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the first folding Apple products, when they arrive, will do so at a cost. In a third foldable-related bombshell dropped Monday, the Barclays analyst Tim Long (via <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/foldable-iphone-price-estimate/\">MacRumors</a>) predicted, based on discussions with Asian manufacturers, that the first “iPhone Fold” will <em>start</em> at an eye-watering $2,300 in the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That might sound implausible, but it’s very much within the current analyst consensus. Earlier this month Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that the price would fall <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2629119/report-folding-iphone-will-be-ultra-thin-crease-free-and-cost-over-2000.html\">between $2,000 and $2,500</a>, and $2,300 fits neatly inside that ballpark. It’s all too plausible, I’m afraid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say, this would make it by far the most expensive iPhone in Apple’s history, almost doubling the $1,199 starting price of the iPhone 16 Pro Max, the company’s current top-of-the-line flagship model. It would exceed the price of a 13-inch iPad Pro with the maximum 2TB allocation of storage (although not if you sprung for cellular and nano-texture glass), or an M4 Max Mac Studio with Final Cut Pro thrown in for good measure. You could buy at least one and possibly two <a href=\"https://www.ebay.co.uk/b/bn_2315845\">used VW Beetles</a>. Perhaps most pertinently, it would be considerably more expensive than the <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/2411140/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review.html\">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, which retails for $1,600.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In future Apple’s defense, the device should boast a set of specs and features that will go some way to justifying that price tag: in particular a titanium alloy hinge that opens to a creaseless 7.8-inch display, far larger than that of any previous iPhone. However, reports also say it will only have two cameras and use <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2629119/report-folding-iphone-will-be-ultra-thin-crease-free-and-cost-over-2000.html\">Touch ID instead of Face ID</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long also said the foldable iPhone is likely to launch in late 2026 or early 2027 (while Kuo says mass production in late 2026, which also signifies a launch sometime in 2027), so there’s still plenty of time to save up.
