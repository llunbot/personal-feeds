Like gems, they exist in myriad bright colors: shiny blue, red, orange, leaf green and transparent flecked with gold. They’re members of a group of 40,000 species of leaf beetles, the Chrysomelidae, one of the most species-rich branches of the vast beetle order, Coleoptera. “You have your weevils, longhorns, and leaf beetles,” she says. “That’s really the trio that dominates beetle diversity.”</p>\n<p>An entomologist at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, <a href=\"https://www.leafbeetles.org/caroline-chaboo/\">Chaboo</a> has long wondered why the kingdom of life is so skewed toward beetles: The tough-bodied creatures make up about a quarter of all animal species. Many biologists have wondered the same thing, for a long time. “Darwin was a beetle collector,” Chaboo notes.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/beetle-anatomy-2.png\"><img alt=\"Despite their kaleidoscopic variety, most beetles share the same three-part body plan.

And that’s just the beetles described so far. Scientists typically describe thousands of new species each year. So—why so many beetle species? “We don’t know the precise answer,” says Chaboo. But clues are emerging.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015249#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015249&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Knowable Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"954d2b0043307dd51f7fc61d3476dea051d9ac5ff143cfb32f0be9352c38f22e","category":"Tech"}
