The enterprise tier is $20/user per month, and each enterprise tier space gets 1,500 compute minutes, 160 Dev Environment hours, and 64GB of Dev Environment storage per paying user. You can use custom blueprints to define best practices for your application code, workflows, and infrastructure. You can publish these blueprints to your CodeCatalyst space, utilizing them for project creation or applying standards to existing projects.</p> \n<p>Blueprints help you set up projects in minutes so you can get to work on code immediately. With just a few clicks, you can set up project files and configure built-in, fully integrated tools (for example, source repository, issue management, and continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline) with best practices for your particular type of project. You can swap in popular tools like GitHub if needed, while maintaining the unified experience. You spend less time on building, integrating, or operating developer tools over the project’s lifetime.</p> \n<p>With custom blueprints, you can define various elements of your CodeCatalyst project, like workflow definitions, infrastructure as code (IaC), and application code. When custom blueprints are updated, those changes are reflected in any project using the blueprint as a pull request update. This streamlined process reduces overhead in setting up your projects and ensures that best practices are consistently applied across your projects. As an admin, you can easily view details about which projects are using each blueprint in your CodeCatalyst space, giving you visibility into how standards are being applied across your projects.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Creating a custom blueprint in CodeCatalyst</strong></span><br /> I open the <a href=\"https://codecatalyst.aws/\">CodeCatalyst console</a> and then I navigate to my space. On the <strong>Settings</strong> tab, I choose <strong>Blueprints </strong>on the left navigation pane, and then I select <strong>Create blueprint</strong>. At this point, I codify my best practices in this blueprint. When ready, I’ll publish it back to my space so my teams can use it to create projects.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/11/13/create-blueprint.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/11/13/create-blueprint-1024x523.png\" alt=\"create-blueprint\" width=\"1024\" height=\"523\" /></a></p> \n<p>After I publish my blueprint, I can view and manage it in my CodeCatalyst space in the <strong>Settings</strong> tab.
