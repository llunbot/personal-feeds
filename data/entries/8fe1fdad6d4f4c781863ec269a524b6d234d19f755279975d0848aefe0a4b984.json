{"title":"Seven Years of Institutional Anti-‘Big-Tech’ Bias at The New York Times Might Lead to Cognitive Dissonance","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/technology/personaltech/roku-data-breach-companies.html","date":1711158420000,"content":"\n<p>Brian X. Chen — the “Tech Fix” columnist for The New York Times who is so unenthused about tech products that <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2019/09/you_could_always_just_use_flash\">he advised readers to “just use flash”</a> rather than upgrade their phone if their low-light photos look bad — in a column on <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/11/roku-tos\">Roku’s recent licensing shenanigans</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Roku’s no-good month stirred discussions in online forums about \nwhat it means when a company can essentially deactivate the device \nyou paid for. That’s similar to how companies like Apple, Google \nand Microsoft can decide to stop issuing software updates for \nolder devices, which gradually degrades their performance. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s just stated as fact. But here’s Chen back in 2017, in a column headlined “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/technology/personaltech/new-iphones-slow-tech-myth.html\">A New Phone Comes Out. Yours Slows Down. A Conspiracy? No.</a>”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The phenomenon of perceived slowdowns is so widespread that many \nbelieve tech companies intentionally cripple smartphones and \ncomputers to ensure that people buy new ones every few years. \nConspiracy theorists call it planned obsolescence. </p>\n\n<p>That’s a myth. While slowdowns happen, they take place for a far \nless nefarious reason. That reason is a software upgrade. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So <em>getting</em> software updates was the cause for slowdowns in 2017, but <em>not getting</em> software updates is now the cause in 2024. Got it.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/22/chen-slow\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8fe1fdad6d4f4c781863ec269a524b6d234d19f755279975d0848aefe0a4b984","category":"Tech"}
