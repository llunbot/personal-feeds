Apple's press release said the policy will also apply to used biometric sensors for Face ID and Touch ID. Apple's existing parts \"pairing\" process will confirm whether or not a used part is genuine.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the fall, Apple says calibration for both new and used genuine Apple parts will happen on device after the part is installed. If an iPhone has been repaired, a \"Parts and Service History\" section appears in the Settings app under General â†’ About, and Apple says it will be expanding this section to show whether a genuine part is new or used.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also announced that customers and service providers will no longer need to provide a device's serial number when ordering parts from its <a href=\"https://selfservicerepair.com/\">self-service repair store</a> for repairs not involving replacement of the logic board.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo deter stolen iPhones from being disassembled for parts, Apple said it will be extending its Activation Lock security feature to iPhone parts:<blockquote>Apple will also extend its popular Activation Lock feature to iPhone parts in order to deter stolen iPhones from being disassembled for parts. Requested by customers and law enforcement officials, the feature was designed to limit iPhone theft by blocking a lost or stolen iPhone from being reactivated. If a device under repair detects that a supported part was obtained from another device with Activation Lock or Lost Mode enabled, calibration capabilities for that part will be restricted.</blockquote>Apple's hardware engineering chief John Ternus said the new policy will be more environmentally friendly by extending the lifespan of parts:<blockquote>For the last two years, teams across Apple have been innovating on product design and manufacturing to support repairs with used Apple parts that won't compromise users' safety, security, or privacy. With this latest expansion to our repair program, we're excited to be adding even more choice and convenience for our customers, while helping to extend the life of our products and their parts.</blockquote>Apple said the policy will apply to future iPhone models.\r<br />\n<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aasp/\">Apple Authorized Service Providers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/independent-repair-provider-program/\">Independent Repair Provider Program</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/self-service-repair/\">Self Service Repair</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/11/apple-to-allow-used-parts-for-repairs/\">Apple to Allow Used Parts for Repairs, Starting With iPhone 15 Lineup</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-allow-used-parts-for-repairs-starting-with-iphone-15-lineup.2423994/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a2ac768cb5e84d8dc92a1187e3111d2a408358f89f96391fa4d02a1273c1194d","category":"Apple"}
