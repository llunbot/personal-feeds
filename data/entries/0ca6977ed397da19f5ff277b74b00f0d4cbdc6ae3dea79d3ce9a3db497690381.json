And for Black Friday they’re finally on sale, with Amazon <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Ace-Wireless-Headphones-Cancellation/dp/B0CYHGTMNH/\">dropping the price down to a cool $349</a>, a savings of $100 off its $449 MSRP and the lowest price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like AirPods Max, which cost $100 more, these over-ear headphones were built for impeccable sound, offering crisp and clear audio, which is perfect for high-quality audio streaming. Plus, they have Spatial Audio built in so you can immerse yourself in whatever you’re listening to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sonos Ace headphones also have active noise cancellation for blocking out distractions, which we noted does “an amazing job of reducing repetitive noise like traffic, air conditioners, airplane noise, etc,” <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2355078/sonos-ace-vs-airpods-max-fit-streaming-bluetooth-power-button-app.html\">in our testing</a>. There’s also an Aware Mode, as Sonos calls it, which allows you to hear what’s going on around you, something that’s often needed for safety reasons, whether you’re not in the best part of town or you’re crossing the street and need to be more aware of traffic around you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We loved the design and fit of the Ace headphones as well and appreciated have well they work with Apple devices as well as other Sonos speakers. Plus they deliver some 30 hours of battery life with ANC enabled, and a simple 3-minute charge gives you another three hours of playback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, Black Friday seems to be the perfect time to get yourself new headphones, including the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Ace-Wireless-Headphones-Cancellation/dp/B0CYHGTMNH/\">Sonos Ace, which are on their very first discount down to $349 at Amazon</a>. So go grab a pair and treat your ears as well as your wallet.</p>\n\n\n<span>Get the amazing Sonos Ace on sale</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Ace-Wireless-Headphones-Cancellation/dp/B0CYHGTMNH/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0ca6977ed397da19f5ff277b74b00f0d4cbdc6ae3dea79d3ce9a3db497690381","category":"Apple"}
