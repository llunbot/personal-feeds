The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoannaStern/status/1782772951365894419\">event invitation</a> has a\ntagline of “Let Loose” and shows an artistic render of an Apple\nPencil, suggesting that iPads will be a focus of the event.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1782785458881302714\">Tim Cook, on Twitter/X</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Pencil us in for May 7! ✏️ #AppleEvent</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The entirety of the iPad lineup is due for updates, and the rumor mill expects a new model, a 13-inch-ish iPad Air. It seems clear a new Apple Pencil is forthcoming. The Pencil 2 launched in 2018, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2018/11/the_2018_ipad_pros\">alongside the 3rd-gen iPads Pro</a>, which sport A12X chips that benchmark comparably to the then-fastest MacBook Pros available. Those were fantastic iPads that foretold the Apple silicon revolution. My personal iPad remains a 2018 11-inch iPad Pro.</p>\n\n<p>Also rumored: a new Magic Keyboard, with a more MacBook-like (and hopefully more durable) aluminum body and a larger trackpad. The current Magic Keyboards <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2020/04/the_ipad_magic_keyboard\">are now four years old</a>. Apple might be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjY4tx4ZTJc\">settling all iPad family business</a> in two weeks.</p>\n\n<p>What I hope to see:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>New Pencil and new Magic Keyboards (11- and 13-inch) that work with all new iPads, Air and Pro alike. The Pencil compatibility situation has been a mess the last few years; now is the time to clean that up with a Pencil 3 that works across all new iPads.</li>\n<li>All new iPads with the front-facing camera on the long side, optimized for use in landscape/laptop orientation.</li>\n<li>Face ID replacing top-button Touch ID in the iPad Airs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Why they’re showing the video at 7am PT / 10am ET, I don’t know. (Glad I’ll be on the East Coast though.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/23/apple-let-loose-event\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b6a2a28d11a48bc8497a8c9b764458f64cc1bf870819ae747a97c12313a8965b","category":"Tech"}
