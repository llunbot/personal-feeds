Like all varieties of the Road Logic, this beauty is crafted with a heat-treated and triple-butted Ritchey Logic tubeset and features aggressively short-butted sections optimized for TIG welding that save weight and improve ride quality. Weighing in at 1.77 kilograms (55cm), the frame and Ritchey Carbon fork fit up to 30mm tires and enjoy Ritchey’s proprietary forged-and-machined integrated headtube that uses standard drop-in bearings and saves 80 grams over a standard head tube design. Best of all, the Road Logic is finished in a delicious Sally’s Macarons paint scheme – a deep red with mauve branding.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2083\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/247e28bbf15f72ef084bc4e38fbfc48c.jpg?fit=1200,2083&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/247e28bbf15f72ef084bc4e38fbfc48c.jpg?w=3840&amp;quality=75 3840w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/247e28bbf15f72ef084bc4e38fbfc48c.jpg?resize=1200,651&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/247e28bbf15f72ef084bc4e38fbfc48c.jpg?resize=2000,1085&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/247e28bbf15f72ef084bc4e38fbfc48c.jpg?resize=768,417&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/247e28bbf15f72ef084bc4e38fbfc48c.jpg?resize=1536,833&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/247e28bbf15f72ef084bc4e38fbfc48c.jpg?resize=2048,1111&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://ritcheylogic.com/bike/frames/road-logic-disc-frameset\" target=\"_blank\">Road Logic Disc</a> €1799/$1799/£1583.90</h3>\n<p>The Road Logic Disc frameset sports some notable new features since its last iteration. For starters, the Road Logic Disc now offers compatibility with Shimano’s newest Di2 semi-wireless groupsets. A new drive side dropout design employs concealed wire routing from the battery in the seat tube, through the bottom bracket area into the chainstay where it makes a stealthy exit to the rear derailleur. But mechanical shifting fans are sure to love the fact that the Road Logic Disc frame also retains cable stops for mechanical groupsets. Finally, the non-drive side chainstay presents a new one-piece truss design for flat mount disc brakes – providing as much stiffness and strength of previous mounts while significantly reducing chainstay weight. The new Road Logic Disc frameset is wrapped in a deep Nigiri shade of green with white logos and weighs 1.94 kilograms for the 55cm frame.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2083\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/5ae382e81d059a80850cfef49afc0976.jpg?fit=1200,2083&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/5ae382e81d059a80850cfef49afc0976.jpg?w=3840&amp;quality=75 3840w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/5ae382e81d059a80850cfef49afc0976.jpg?resize=1200,651&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/5ae382e81d059a80850cfef49afc0976.jpg?resize=2000,1085&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/5ae382e81d059a80850cfef49afc0976.jpg?resize=768,417&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/5ae382e81d059a80850cfef49afc0976.jpg?resize=1536,833&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/5ae382e81d059a80850cfef49afc0976.jpg?resize=2048,1111&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://ritcheylogic.com/bike/frames/break-away-road-logic-frameset\" target=\"_blank\">Road Logic Break-Away®</a> €2299/$2299/£2024*</h3>\n<p>The days of navigating airports and taxis with bulky and unruly bike boxes on the way to and from distant cycling destinations are a thing of the past.
