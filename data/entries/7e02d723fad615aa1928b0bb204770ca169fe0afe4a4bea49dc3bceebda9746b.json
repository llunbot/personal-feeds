And while these two models have continued to converge, there are a ton of differences. Somewhere in the 100+ differences range if you were to add them all up (and those are just big-ticket differences).</p>\n<p>In this post (and the above video), I dive into every single difference I could find, hands-on, with these two watches. It’s as simple as that. Let’s get into it.</p>\n<h3><strong><u>The Pricing and Models:</u></strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"GarminInstinct3Series.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/GarminInstinct3Series.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/GarminInstinct3Series.png 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/GarminInstinct3Series-200x113.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/GarminInstinct3Series-720x405.png 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/GarminInstinct3Series-124x70.png 124w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/GarminInstinct3Series-300x169.png 300w\" /></p>\n<p>First up, is the most obvious – pricing. The Fenix 8 is 2-3x the price of the Instinct 3, depending on which exact model you get. The Instinct 3 starts at $399 and goes up to $499, while the Fenix 8 starts at $999, and goes up to $1,199</p>\n<p>Thus, here are the core models from the Instinct 3 realm::</p>\n<blockquote><p>Instinct 3 AMOLED (45mm): $449USD<br />\nInstinct 3 AMOLED (50mm): $499USD<br />\nInstinct 3 SOLAR (45mm): $399USD<br />\nInstinct 3 SOLAR (50mm): $449USD</p></blockquote>\n<p>Note – I’m *NOT* including the new Instinct E in this comparison. The Instinct E is not an Instinct 3, nor even an Instinct 2. It’s like an Instinct 1.5. And given I still can’t get clarity on what features are actually in the darn watch (versus ripped out), I’ll wait until the unit I ordered has arrived. At this point, I see that model as dead in the water from a price/features standpoint. But again, it’s *NOT* an Instinct 3 or anything near it. Just go buy an Instinct 2 on sale for $200.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"GarminFenix8SEries.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/GarminFenix8SEries.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/GarminFenix8SEries.png 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/GarminFenix8SEries-200x113.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/GarminFenix8SEries-720x405.png 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/GarminFenix8SEries-124x70.png 124w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/GarminFenix8SEries-300x169.png 300w\" /></p>\n<p>In any case, and on the Fenix 8 side:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Fenix 8 AMOLED (43mm): $999USD ($1,099 for Sapphire/Titanium)<br />\nFenix 8 AMOLED (47mm): $999USD ($1,099 for Sapphire/Titanium)<br />\nFenix 8 AMOLED (51mm): $1,099USD ($1,199 for Sapphire/Titanium)<br />\nFenix 8 SOLAR (47mm): $1,099USD (Sapphire/Titanium only)<br />\nFenix 8 SOLAR (51mm): $1,199USD (Sapphire/Titanium only)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now, before we get too far, I will point out that if price is the barrier to your Fenix, the most logical solution is Garmin’s own <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4alYmlg\">Epix (Gen 2) at $399 most days</a>. Remember, the Epix naming is simply what they called the AMOLED version of the Fenix 7/7 Pro, before merging the names in the Fenix 8 series. And given the Fenix 8 was mostly about adding dive and speaker functionality (rather than any other new sport/fitness features), you won’t be missing out if you don’t care about dive/speaker. Note that the Epix Pro/Fenix 7 Pro are floating in the $600-$700 range, and that includes the Gen5 sensor and LED flashlight.</p>\n<p>Still, the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4alYmlg\">Epix at $399</a> gives you far more software functionality than the Instinct 3 AMOLED,  in a package that’s equally durable. It’s kinda a no-brainer unless you really want the Instinct-specific look.</p>\n<h3><span><strong>The Hardware Differences:</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"vlcsnap-2025-01-14-22h01m25s167.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-22h01m25s167.png\" alt=\"Vlcsnap 2025 01 14 22h01m25s167.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-22h01m25s167.png 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-22h01m25s167-200x113.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-22h01m25s167-720x405.png 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-22h01m25s167-124x70.png 124w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-22h01m25s167-300x169.png 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Next, let’s look at how they differ from a hardware standpoint. Obviously, the biggest difference is frankly, just the styling design. The Instinct series roughly imitates the look of a Casio G-Shock watch, while the Fenix lineup has a pretty consistent design style of its own, over the last 10 versions.</p>\n<p>Still, setting that styling aside, there are practical hardware and materials differences, they are as follows:</p>\n<p>– Fenix 8 offers 3 case sizes (43/47/51mm) while Instinct offers two case sizes (45/50mm)<br />\n– Fenix 8 bezel materials is either stainless steel or titanium (depending on model) vs plastic for Instinct<br />\n– Fenix 8 backing (underside) is metal, whereas Instinct is plastic<br />\n– Fenix 8 has larger displays at 1.3” &amp; 1.4”, versus Instinct 3 AMOLED at 1.2”/1.3” and SOLAR at 0.9”/1.1””<br />\n– Fenix 8 has a touchscreen, Instinct 3 has no touchscreen<br />\n– Fenix 8 MIP-display is color, whereas Instinct 3 MIP display is black/white (both units AMOLED displays appear identical in color range)<br />\n– Fenix 8 has sapphire display lens option, Instinct 3 does not<br />\n– Fenix 8 has a speaker for audibly playing voice/music/voice commands/assistant, whereas Instinct 3 has a beeper only<br />\n– Fenix 8 has a microphone for taking calls (if phone is nearby), whereas Instinct 3 does not<br />\n– Fenix 8 has WiFi for syncing data/music/maps, whereas Instinct 3 has no WiFi<br />\n– Fenix 8 has offline music playback/storage (Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube Music), Instinct 3 does not<br />\n– Fenix 8 has 32GB of storage, whereas Instinct 3 has 3GB (AMOLED) or 90MB (SOLAR)<br />\n– Fenix 8 has ELEVATE Gen 5 optical heart rate sensor (with ECG &amp; skin temp), whereas Instinct has Gen 4 (no ECG/Skin Temp)<br />\n– Fenix 8 has a nacho cheese dispenser, Instinct 3 does not<br />\n– Fenix 8 has a depth gauge, for measuring diving down to 40m, Instinct 3 does not have any depth gauge<br />\n– Fenix 8 has inductive buttons (theoretically leak-proof design), whereas Instinct 3 has traditional o-ring seal buttons<br />\n– Fenix 8 has a ‘sensor guard’ to protect the microphone/barometer in between the two right buttons, Instinct 3 does not<br />\n– Fenix 8 weight ranges from 72g to 92g, whereas Instinct weighs 52g to 59g</p>\n<p>Note that from a hardware standpoint, they are similar in this respect:</p>\n<p>– Both units have 5 buttons<br />\n– Both units have barometric altimeters<br />\n– Both units have a magnetic compass<br />\n– Both units dual-frequency/multi-band GNSS/GPS with SatIQ<br />\n– Both units have a flashlight with white/red LED<br />\n– Both units have SOLAR on the MIP displays (not on AMOLED)<br />\n– Both units use newer SOLAR panel tech on MIP displays (not on AMOLED)<br />\n– Both units use standard watch strap/band sizing and attach systems<br />\n– Both units are compatible with Garmin QuickFit bands/straps<br />\n– Both units have 100m water resistance rating<br />\n– Both units have Garmin Pay<br />\n– Neither unit has built-in cellular connectivity (requires your phone nearby for cellular connectivity)</p>\n<p>Next, there’s the battery differences. Now obviously, there’s a lot of models here, and they all have different battery claims. Thus…umm…yeah. I’m just gonna give you two battery charts. TLDR: Both AMOLED product lines honestly give you relatively similar AMOLED life if comparing 50mm Instinct 3 AMOLED to 47mm Fenix 8 AMOLED, and both SOLAR product lines give you relatively similar life between 50mm Instinct 3 SOLAR &amp; 47mm Fenix 8 Solar. Here’s the Instinct 3 lineup first:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"BatteryLifeInstinct3.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/BatteryLifeInstinct3-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/BatteryLifeInstinct3-1.png 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/BatteryLifeInstinct3-1-200x93.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/BatteryLifeInstinct3-1-720x334.png 720w\" /></p>\n<p>The core line items I’d personally be comparing are:</p>\n<p>1) Smartwatch battery life (always-on)<br />\n2) SatIQ battery life (the main GPS sports mode). In the Instinct chart above, SatIQ is presumed on for “All Systems Plus Multi-band”, as it should be.</p>\n<p>And then the Fenix 8 lineup next:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Fenix8BatteryLIfe.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Fenix8BatteryLIfe.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"719\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Fenix8BatteryLIfe.png 1438w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Fenix8BatteryLIfe-200x111.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Fenix8BatteryLIfe-720x401.png 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Fenix8BatteryLIfe-124x70.png 124w\" /></p>\n<p>Of course, where things get a bit crazy is on the Instinct 3 SOLAR side in basic smartwatch mode, where you can basically get to unlimited power if you’ve got enough sun.</p>\n<p>Ok, got all that? Good, let’s start looking at the software side, which is where things get quite a bit more complex.</p>\n<h3><span><strong>The Software Feature Differences:</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Fenix8vsInstinct3.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Fenix8vsInstinct3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Fenix8vsInstinct3.png 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Fenix8vsInstinct3-200x113.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Fenix8vsInstinct3-720x405.png 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Fenix8vsInstinct3-124x70.png 124w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Fenix8vsInstinct3-300x169.png 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Garmin is arguably the king of software differentiation between devices. Arguably, it’s why they are so successful as a business, due to their ability to upsell you on higher-end devices with more features. Some of these are obvious differences (e.g. no maps), but many are actually much more nuanced. I’d wager that on a device like the Garmin Fenix 8, there are probably between 800 and 1,000 features. Maybe more. Every toggle is effectively a feature. Silly things like “Is the water salt or fresh?” in the dive gas calculation settings, is a feature. As are other features you’ve likely never used, like the beat type for the running metronome, or whether or not ‘Spot Soundings’ are enabled in the map view, or whether it avoids ferries during routing.</p>\n<p>The point is, the below is my best attempt at distilling those 1,000 different features into something manageable. But I’ll warn you, this list is 1,000 features long. As such, when I say “maps aren’t on the Instinct 3”, then in turn, the 30-50 different map-related features and settings aren’t there either. Most of them I won’t line-item out. Make sense? Good. Let’s get cooking.</p>\n<p>– No mapping of any type on the Instinct 3 (you route via breadcrumb routes)<br />\n– No unplanned offline routing (e.g., round trip routing, route to a point via trails, etc…) on Instinct 3<br />\n– No ECG features/Afib detection/Skin Temp tracking on Instinct 3<br />\n– No Endurance Score on Instinct 3<br />\n– No Hill Score on Instinct 3<br />\n– No ClimbPro on Instinct 3 (just total/full elevation plot)<br />\n– No Cycling Ability feature on Instinct 3<br />\n– No Stamina feature on Instinct 3<br />\n– No JetLag advisor on Instinct 3<br />\n– No Scuba/Diving features on Instinct 3<br />\n– No Voice Assistants on Instinct 3<br />\n– No Voice Commands on Instinct 3<br />\n– No Voice notes on Instinct 3<br />\n– No Calling on Instinct 3<br />\n– No Countdown calendars/timers on instinct 3<br />\n– No DogTrack widget on Instinct 3<br />\n– No Fish Forecast widget on Instinct 3<br />\n– No Recovery widget on Instinct 3<br />\n– No Stocks widget on Instinct 3<br />\n– No ‘Focus Modes’ on Instinct 3<br />\n– No cloud re-processing of Instinct 3 GPS tracks (using internal sensor data to improve accuracy)<br />\n– No new UI on Instinct 3 (‘Active Navigation’ menu, notifications menu)<br />\n– No customizable low battery alert on Instinct 3 (Fenix 8 can customize it)</p>\n<p>Again, that covers most of the major features, though of course, each one of the above features typically has a pile of features/settings within it.</p>\n<p>Note, the Instinct 3 AMOLED does technically have a city map-thingy. It’s near-impossible to describe, because it’s so useless. But essentially, if you zoom out far enough on the empty ‘map’, you’ll see a single dot for medium to large cities. I suppose the idea here is that if you’re so horribly lost that just the right general direction towards a big city will help, then this might work. And had Garmin done this for smaller towns, I’d say it actually would be useful. But if you need help, navigating to a big city is really not super helpful. I want to know the small town that can probably save me 3-4KM away, not a city with an airport 50KM away.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"vlcsnap-2025-01-14-21h52m48s509.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-21h52m48s509.png\" alt=\"Vlcsnap 2025 01 14 21h52m48s509.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-21h52m48s509.png 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-21h52m48s509-200x113.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-21h52m48s509-720x405.png 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-21h52m48s509-124x70.png 124w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-21h52m48s509-300x169.png 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Otherwise, navigation on the Instinct 3 is essentially just following a breadcrumb trail on the watch, with occasional turn notifications (e.g. to turn left or right). Here’s side-by-side with a Garmin Fenix 8:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"vlcsnap-2025-01-14-21h52m34s367.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-21h52m34s367.png\" alt=\"Vlcsnap 2025 01 14 21h52m34s367.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-21h52m34s367.png 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-21h52m34s367-200x113.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-21h52m34s367-720x405.png 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-21h52m34s367-124x70.png 124w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-21h52m34s367-300x169.png 300w\" /></p>\n<p>And while that generally gets you where you’re going (as it has on many devices for close to 20 years), in 2025 I struggle to see how that’s competitive to most other watches on the market at or below this price point.</p>\n<h3><span><strong>Sport Modes &amp; Sensor Support:</strong></span></h3>\n<p>When it comes to sport modes, this is an entirely ugly beast by itself, so, I’ve painstakingly written them all out. But essentially the additive differences are in bold at the end. You’re welcome.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span>Instinct 3 Sport Profiles (as of  Jan 14th, 2025):</span> </strong>Multisport, Walk, Golf, Climb, Bouldering, Fish, Hunt, Disc Golf, Horseback, Archery, Inline Skating, Walk, Run, Treadmill, Trail Run, Hike, Virtual Run, Track Run, Indoor Track, Obstacle Racing, Triathlon, Swimrun, Bike, Bike Indoor, MTB, eBike, eMTB, CycloCross, Gravel Bike, Bike Commute, Bike Tour, Road Bike, BMX, Pool Swim, Openwater Swim, Swimrun, Strength, Cardio, HIIT, Yoga, Pilates, Elliptical, Stair Stepper, Walk Indoor, Row Indoor, Climb Indoor, Floor Climb, Boxing, Mixed Marital Arts, Ski, Snowboard, Backcountry Ski, Backcountry Snowboard, XC Classic Ski, XC Skate Ski, Snowshoe, Ice Skating, Kayak, Row, SUP, Surf, Kiteboarding, Windsurf, Whitewater, Boat, Wakeboard, Wakesurf, Water Ski, Tube, Snorkel, Soccer/Football, American Football, Basketball, Baseball, Softball, Volleyball, Cricket, Lacrosse, Rugby, Field Hockey, Ice Hockey, Ultimate Disc, Gaming, Tennis, Pickleball, Padel, Racquetball, Squash, Badminton, Table Tennis, Platform Tennis, ATV, Snowmobile, Overland, Motocross, Motorcycle, Horseback, Breathwork, Tactical, Gaming, Expedition, Other</p>\n<p><span><strong>Fenix 8 Sport Profiles (as of  Jan 14th, 2025):</strong></span> Multisport, Walk, Golf, Climb, Bouldering, Fish, Hunt, Disc Golf, Horseback, Archery, Inline Skating, Walk, Run, Treadmill, Trail Run, Hike, Virtual Run, Track Run, Indoor Track, Obstacle Racing, Triathlon, Swimrun, Bike, Bike Indoor, MTB, eBike, eMTB, CycloCross, Gravel Bike, Bike Commute, Bike Tour, Road Bike, BMX, Pool Swim, Openwater Swim, Swimrun, Strength, Cardio, HIIT, Yoga, Pilates, Elliptical, Stair Stepper, Walk Indoor, Row Indoor, Climb Indoor, Floor Climb, Boxing, Mixed Marital Arts, Ski, Snowboard, Backcountry Ski, Backcountry Snowboard, XC Classic Ski, XC Skate Ski, Snowshoe, Ice Skating, Kayak, Row, SUP, Surf, Kiteboarding, Windsurf, Whitewater, Boat, Wakeboard, Wakesurf, Water Ski, Tube, Snorkel, Soccer/Football, American Football, Basketball, Baseball, Softball, Volleyball, Cricket, Lacrosse, Rugby, Field Hockey, Ice Hockey, Ultimate Disc, Gaming, Tennis, Pickleball, Padel, Racquetball, Squash, Badminton, Table Tennis, Platform Tennis, ATV, Snowmobile, Overland, Motocross, Motorcycle, Horseback, Breathwork, Tactical, Gaming, Expedition, Other, ***<strong><em>Mountaineering, Adventure Race, Ultra Run, Jump Rope, Sail, Sail Expedition, Tempo Training (Golf), Scuba Dive, Apnea Dive, Meditation***</em></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Essentially, the Fenix series gives you the scuba diving and free diving you’d expect, plus sailing sport profiles and a few others. Though, I’d love to hear the reason they thought they had for withholding Jump Rope from the Instinct. Is the Jump Rope Mafia so big that they specifically want to upsell them?</p>\n<p>When it comes to sensor types, here’s what each unit supports:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span><strong>Garmin Instinct 3 sensors:</strong></span> External HR (BT/ANT+), Speed/Cadence (BT/ANT+), Power (BT/ANT+), Foot pod (BT/ANT+), Garmin VIRB, Garmin Tempe, Cycling Lights (ANT+), Cycling Radar (ANT+), Extended Display (ANT+), RD Pod (ANT+), Xero Laser Locations, Garmin inReach, DogTrack, Smart Trainers (ANT+), eBike (ANT+)</p>\n<p><span><strong>Garmin Fenix 8 sensors:</strong> </span>External HR (BT/ANT+), Speed/Cadence (BT/ANT+), Power (BT/ANT+), Foot pod (BT/ANT+), Garmin VIRB, Garmin Tempe, Cycling Lights (ANT+), Cycling Radar (ANT+), Extended Display (ANT+), RD Pod (ANT+), Xero Laser Locations, Garmin inReach, DogTrack, Smart Trainers (ANT+), eBike (ANT+), ***<strong><em>Golf Club Sensor, Rangerfinder, Headphones (Bluetooth), Shifting (ANT+), Shimano Di2 (ANT)***</em></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The differences above being the last 5 sensor types are available on Fenix, but not Instinct 3. Also, for lack of anywhere else to mention it – both watches support offline data transfer from the Garmin HRM-PRO series of straps, and both watches support Garmin Rally power meter pedal Cycling Dynamic metrics.</p>\n<h3><span><strong>Things That Are The Same:</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"FlashlightFeatures.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" /></p>\n<p>Now, there’s an absolute boatload of features that are either identical, or effectively identical (meaning maybe slight UI styling differences). They are as follows:</p>\n<p>– Both have Daily Activity tracking that seems identical (e.g., steps/stairs/HR/etc…)<br />\n– Both have sleep and nap tracking  (except wrist temp tracking as noted above)<br />\n– Both have the same flashlight levels and software features<br />\n– Both have Sleep Coach &amp; Sleep Score features<br />\n– Both have Garmin Body Battery features<br />\n– Both have Garmin Training Readiness features<br />\n– Both have HRV tracking/status features<br />\n– Both have stress tracking features<br />\n– Both have Blood oxygen tracking (aka SpO2/PulseOx)<br />\n– Both have Respiration rate tracking<br />\n– Both can create folders for widgets/glances<br />\n– Both do altitude acclimation<br />\n– Both have Health Snapshot feature<br />\n– Both have Garmin Messenger app<br />\n– Both have Garmin Share app<br />\n– Both have music controls (of phone)<br />\n– Both have tide tracking features/widgets<br />\n– Both have moon phase tracking features/widgets<br />\n– Both support Connect IQ watch faces/apps/data fields<br />\n– Both have customizable watch faces<br />\n– Both have project waypoint and reference waypoint features<br />\n– Both have broadcasting of heart rate (on both ANT+ &amp; Bluetooth Smart)<br />\n– Both have Garmin PacePro (on Fenix 8 can also do unplanned PacePro routes)<br />\n– Both have triathlon auto transition<br />\n– Both have Performance Conditions, Training Load, Training Load Focus, Load Ratio<br />\n– Both have strength training Muscle Maps &amp; Workout Animations (though not Instinct 3 SOLAR)<br />\n– Both have Garmin LiveTracking (with phone nearby)<br />\n– Both have safety and incident detection features (e.g., fall/crash detection)<br />\n– Both have Battery Power Saver Mode<br />\n– Both have Battery Power Manager modes/customizations (e.g., Extended/Max Battery/Jacket/etc…)</p>\n<p>Finally, when it comes to accuracy, from a GPS track standpoint, both, as noted earlier, likely share the exact same chipset, and from a specs standpoint, both are identical. More importantly though, all of my testing across openwater swimming, cycling (road and gravel), running (trails &amp; road) and hiking, has shown them to be identical and highly accurate from a GPS perspective. Garmin’s multi-band/dual-frequency GPS implementation continues to be the market leader:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"GPS2Instinct3.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/GPS2Instinct3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"478\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/GPS2Instinct3.png 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/GPS2Instinct3-200x133.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/GPS2Instinct3-720x478.png 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/GPS2Instinct3-300x200.png 300w\" /></p>\n<p>However, when it comes to heart rate sensor accuracy, there is a moderate difference. The Instinct 3 features Garmin’s much older ELEVATE Gen4 optical heart rate sensor, whereas the Garmin Fenix 8 uses the newer but still nearly two-year-old Gen5 optical heart rate sensor. That sensor is among the best in the industry.</p>\n<p>In many scenarios, you frankly won’t notice a difference. However, in more challenging scenarios, you will. Challenging in the case of optical HR sensors means things like outdoor cycling (indoor cycling is easy), cold conditions, or some very high-intensity interval conditions. As a simple example of those sometimes vast differences, here’s an interval run last night in cooler temps (~50°F/12°C). In this case, we see the Instinct 3 with Gen4 struggle heavily on these intervals, whereas the Gen5-based Fenix 8 had no issues:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Fenix8-Instinct3-HRAccuracy.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Fenix8-Instinct3-HRAccuracy.png\" alt=\"Fenix8 Instinct3 HRAccuracy.\" width=\"718\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Fenix8-Instinct3-HRAccuracy.png 1436w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Fenix8-Instinct3-HRAccuracy-200x78.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Fenix8-Instinct3-HRAccuracy-720x282.png 720w\" /></p>\n<p>Inversely, on this trail run in warmer temps, there was no meaningful difference between the Instinct 3 and the reference data:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Fenix8-Instinct3-TrailRun.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Fenix8-Instinct3-TrailRun.png\" alt=\"Fenix8 Instinct3 TrailRun.\" width=\"717\" height=\"271\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Fenix8-Instinct3-TrailRun.png 1434w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Fenix8-Instinct3-TrailRun-200x76.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Fenix8-Instinct3-TrailRun-720x272.png 720w\" /></p>\n<p>As always, you can decide which features are most important to you. Note <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/08/garmin-enduro-3-in-depth-review-vs-fenix8-solar.html\">that there’s also the MIP-based/solar Enduro 3, which sits at $899</a>, which has all the Fenix 8 features except the dive/speaker function. But does contain the newer Gen5 optical HR sensor.</p>\n<h3><span><strong>Wrap-Up:</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"vlcsnap-2025-01-14-22h00m20s537.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-22h00m20s537.png\" alt=\"Vlcsnap 2025 01 14 22h00m20s537.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-22h00m20s537.png 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-22h00m20s537-200x113.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-22h00m20s537-720x405.png 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-22h00m20s537-124x70.png 124w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-14-22h00m20s537-300x169.png 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Ultimately, it’s probably going to come down to how much you value maps or the optical HR sensors. Those continue to stand out as the big-ticket items. And as I’ve said many times above here, if you don’t care as much about the optical HR sensor, then you can easily pick up a Fenix 7/Epix (Gen 2) unit, which has virtually every software feature outlined above, for pretty much the same price as the Instinct 3 (and with better case materials). But of course, it’s not all about features. Some prefer the styling of the Fenix, or perhaps the lighter feel of the Instinct 3.</p>\n<p>Either way, there’s plenty of choices in this market, from not just Garmin, but Suunto (Suunto Race series), Polar (Polar Vantage series), or COROS (Pace Pro or Vertix series). And, of course, even more budget options like the AmazFit (T-Rex 3).</p>\n<p>Ultimately, most people are buying into the Garmin Instinct or Fenix ecosystem for the depth of the watch features, but also the depth of the online/app platform – neither of which their competitors come anywhere near.</p>\n<p>With that – thanks for reading!</p><div>\n<h3>Found This Post Useful?
