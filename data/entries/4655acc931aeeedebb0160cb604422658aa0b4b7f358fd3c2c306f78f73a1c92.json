{"title":"Inclusive Dark Mode: Designing Accessible Dark Themes For All Users","link":"https://smashingmagazine.com/2025/04/inclusive-dark-mode-designing-accessible-dark-themes/","date":1744722000000,"content":"<p>Dark mode, a beloved feature in modern digital interfaces, offers a visually striking alternative to traditional light themes. Its allure lies in the striking visual contrast it provides, a departure from the light themes that have dominated our screens for decades. </p>\n<p>However, its design often misses the mark on an important element — accessibility. For users with visual impairments or sensitivities, <a href=\"https://builtin.com/articles/myths-realities-dark-mode-ui\">dark mode can introduce significant challenges</a> if not thoughtfully implemented.</p>\n<p>Hence, designing themes with these users in mind can improve user comfort in low-light settings while creating <strong>a more equitable digital experience</strong> for everyone. Let’s take a look at exactly how this can be done. </p>\nThe Pros And Cons Of Dark Modes In Terms Of Accessibility\n<p>Dark mode can offer tangible accessibility benefits when implemented with care. For many users, especially those who experience <strong>light sensitivity</strong>, a well-calibrated dark theme can reduce eye strain and provide a more comfortable reading experience. In low-light settings, the softer background tones and reduced glare may <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/dark-mode-users-issues/\">help lessen fatigue and improve visual focus</a>.</p>\n<p>However, these benefits are not universal. For some users, particularly those with conditions such as <a href=\"https://www.boia.org/blog/dark-mode-can-improve-text-readability-but-not-for-everyone\">astigmatism or low contrast sensitivity</a>, dark mode can actually compromise readability. Light text on a dark background may lead to blurred edges or halo effects around characters, making it harder to distinguish content. </p>\nThe Role Of Contrast In Dark Mode Accessibility\n<p>When you’re designing, <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/09/realities-myths-contrast-color/\">contrast isn’t just another design element</a>, it’s a key player in dark mode’s overall readability and accessibility. A well-designed dark mode, with the right contrast, can also enhance user engagement, creating <strong>a more immersive experience</strong> and drawing users into the content.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/inclusive-dark-mode-designing-accessible-dark-themes/6-contrast-in-dark-mode.png\" /></p>\n<p>First and foremost, cleverly executing your site’s dark mode will result in a lower bounce rate (<a href=\"https://web.dev/case-studies/terra-dark-mode\">as much as 70%, according to one case study from Brazil</a>). You can then further hack this statistic and greet visitors with a deep black, <a href=\"https://bluetree.digital/paid-vs-organic-search/\">reinforcing your rankings in organic search results</a> by sending positive signals to Google. </p>\n<p>How is this possible? Well, the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-49282-3_13\">darker tones can hold attention longer</a>, especially in low-light settings, leading to <strong>higher interaction rates</strong> while making your design more accessible. The point is, without proper contrast, even the sleekest dark mode design can become difficult to navigate and uncomfortable to use. </p>\nDesigning For Contrast In Dark Mode\n<p>Instead of using pure black backgrounds, which can cause eye strain and make text harder to read, opt for <strong>dark grays</strong>. These <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/learn/contrasting-colors/\">softer tones help reduce harsh contrast</a> and provide a modern look. </p>\n<p>However, it’s important to note that color adjustments alone don’t solve technical challenges like <strong>anti-aliasing</strong>. In dark mode, anti-aliasing has the problem of <strong>halo effects</strong>, where the edges of the text appear blurred or overly luminous. To mitigate these issues, designers should test their interfaces on various devices and browsers and consider <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-smooth\">CSS properties</a> to improve text clarity. </p>\n<p><strong>Real-world user testing</strong>, especially with individuals who have visual impairments, is essential to fine-tune these details and ensure an accessible experience for all users.</p>\n<p>For individuals with low vision or color blindness, the right contrast can mean the difference between a frustrating and a seamless user experience. To keep your dark mode design looking its best, don’t forget to also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to choose high-contrast color combinations for improved readability.</li>\n<li>Make sure you avoid overly saturated colors, as they can strain the eyes in dark mode.</li>\n<li>Use <a href=\"https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/\">contrast checker tools like WebAIM</a> to evaluate your design choices and ensure accessibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These simple adjustments make a big difference in creating a dark mode that everyone can use comfortably.</p>\nThe Importance Of Readability In Dark Themes\n<p>While dark themes provide a sleek and visually appealing interface, some features still require lighter colors to remain functional and readable. </p>\n<p>Certain interactive elements like buttons or form fields <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/06/designing-efficient-web-forms/\">need to be easily distinguishable</a>, especially if it involves transactions or providing personal information. Simply put, no one <a href=\"https://apryse.com/capabilities/digital-signature\">wants to sign documents digitally</a> if they have to look for the right field, nor do they want to make a transaction <a href=\"https://britepayments.com/resources/article/drivers-and-solutions-of-e-commerce-checkout-friction/\">if there is friction</a>. </p>\n<p>In addition to human readability, <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/developing-semantic-web/\">machine readability is equally important</a> in an age of increased automation. Machine readability refers to how effective computers and bots are at extracting and processing data from the interface without human intervention. It’s important for pretty much any type of interface that has automation built into the workflows. For example, if the interface utilizes machine learning, <a href=\"https://www.xbrl.org/news/the-value-of-structured-machine-readable-data-in-training-generative-ai/\">machine readability is essential</a>. Machine learning relies on accurate, quality data and effective interaction between different modules and systems, which makes machine readability critical to make it effective.</p>\n<p>You can help ensure your dark mode interface is machine-readable in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use clear, semantic markup.</strong><br />Write your HTML so that it naturally describes the structure of the page. This means using proper tags (like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>) and ARIA roles. When your code is organized this way, machines can read and understand your page better, regardless of whether it's in dark or light mode.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep the structure consistent across themes.</strong><br />Whether users choose dark mode or light mode, the underlying structure of your content should remain the same. This consistency ensures that screen readers and other accessibility tools can interpret the page without confusion.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintain good color contrast.</strong><br />In dark mode, use color choices that meet accessibility standards. This not only helps people with low vision but also ensures that automated tools can verify your design’s accessibility.</li>\n<li><strong>Implement responsive styles with media queries.</strong><br />Use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme\">CSS media queries like ‘prefers-color-scheme’</a> to automatically adjust the interface based on the user’s system settings. This makes sure that the switch between dark and light modes happens smoothly and predictably, which helps both users and assistive technologies process the content correctly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Making sure that data, especially in automated systems, is clear and accessible prevents functionality breakdowns and guarantees seamless workflows.</p>\nBest Strategies For Designing Accessible Dark Themes\n<p>Although we associate visual accessibility with visual impairments, the truth is that it’s actually meant for everyone. Easier access is something we all strive for, right? But more than anything, <strong>practicality is what matters</strong>. Fortunately, the strategies below fit the description to a tee. </p>\n<h3>Strengthen Contrast For Usability</h3>\n<p>Contrast is the backbone of dark mode design. Without proper implementation, elements blend together, creating a frustrating user experience. Instead of looking at contrast as just a relationship between colors, try to view it in the context of other UI elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rethink background choices.</strong><br />Instead of pure black, which can cause harsh contrast and eye strain, <a href=\"https://www.color-hex.com/color/121212\">use dark gray shades like #121212</a>. These tones offer a softer, more adaptable visual experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Prioritize key elements.</strong><br />Ensure interactive elements like buttons and links <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html\">have contrast ratios exceeding 4.5:1</a>. This not only aids readability but also emphasizes functionality.</li>\n<li><strong>Test in real environments.</strong><br />Simulate low-light and high-glare conditions to see how contrast performs in real-life scenarios.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Pay Special Attention To Typography In Dark Themes</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/04/when-typography-speaks-louder-than-words/\">use of effective typography is vital</a> for preserving readability in dark mode. In particular, the right font choice can make your design both visually appealing and functional, while the wrong one can cause strain and confusion for users. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/inclusive-dark-mode-designing-accessible-dark-themes/2-darkmode-font.png\" /></p>\n<p>Thus, when designing dark themes, it’s essential to prioritize text clarity without sacrificing aesthetics. You can do this by prioritizing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sans-serif fonts</strong><br />They are often <a href=\"https://www.kimp.io/sans-serif-fonts/\">the best option for dark mode</a>, as they offer a clean, modern look and remain highly readable when paired with a well-balanced contrast. </li>\n<li><strong>Strategic use of light elements</strong><br />Consider incorporating subtle, lighter accents to emphasize key elements, such as headings, call-to-action buttons, or critical information, without fully shifting to a light mode. These accents act as visual cues, drawing attention to important content.</li>\n<li><strong>Proper font metrics and stylization</strong><br />It’s important to consider font size and weight—larger, bolder fonts tend to stand out better against dark backgrounds, ensuring that your text is easy to read.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Make Sure Your Color Integration Is Thoughtful</h3>\n<p>Colors in dark mode require a delicate balance to ensure accessibility. It’s not as simple as looking at a list of complimentary color pairs and basing your designs around them. Instead, you must think about how users with visual impairments will experience the dark theme design. </p>\n<p>While avoiding color combinations like red and green for the sake of colorblind users is a widely known rule, visual impairment is more than just color blindness. In particular, you have to pay attention to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Low vision</strong>: Ensure text is clear with strong contrast and scalable fonts. Avoid thin typefaces and cluttered layouts for better readability.</li>\n<li><strong>Light sensitivity</strong> (photophobia): Minimize bright elements against dark backgrounds to reduce eye strain. Provide brightness and contrast adjustment options for comfort.</li>\n<li><strong>Glaucoma</strong>: Use bold, clear fonts and simplify layouts to minimize visual confusion. Focus on reducing clutter and enhancing readability.</li>\n<li><strong>Macular degeneration</strong>: Provide large text and high-contrast visuals to aid users with central vision loss. Refrain from relying on centrally aligned, intricate elements.</li>\n<li><strong>Diabetic retinopathy</strong>: Keep designs simple, avoiding patterns or textures that obscure content. Use high-contrast and well-spaced elements for clarity.</li>\n<li><strong>Retinitis pigmentosa</strong>: Place essential elements centrally with high contrast for those with peripheral vision loss. Avoid spreading critical information across wide areas.</li>\n<li><strong>Cataracts</strong>: Reduce glare by using dark gray backgrounds instead of pure black. Incorporate soft, muted colors, and avoid sharp contrasts.</li>\n<li><strong>Night blindness</strong>: Provide bright, legible text with balanced contrast against dark themes. Steer clear of overly dim elements that can strain vision.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see, there are a lot of different considerations. Something you need to account for is that it’s nigh-on impossible to have a solution that will fix all the issues. You can’t test an interface for every single individual who uses it. The best you can do is <strong>make it as accessible as possible for as many users as possible</strong>, and you can always make adjustments in later iterations if there are major issues for a segment of users.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/inclusive-dark-mode-designing-accessible-dark-themes/3-examples-different-dark-mode-apps.png\" /></p>\nUnderstanding Color Perception And Visual Impairments To Get The Ideal Dark Mode\n<p>Even though dark mode doesn’t target only users with visual impairments, their input and ease of use are perhaps the most important. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/color-theory-for-designers-part-1-the-meaning-of-color/\">role of color perception</a> in dark mode varies significantly among users, especially for those with visual impairments like color blindness or low vision. These conditions can make it challenging to distinguish certain colors on dark backgrounds, which can affect how users navigate and interact with your design.</p>\n<p>In particular, some colors that seem vibrant in light mode may appear muted or blend into the background, making it difficult for users to see or interact with key elements. This is exactly why <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/03/guide-user-testing/\">testing your color palette across different displays and lighting conditions</a> is essential to ensure consistency and accessibility. However, you probably won’t be able to test for every single screen type, device, or environmental condition. Once again, make the dark mode interface as accessible as possible, and make adjustments in later iterations based on feedback.</p>\n<p>For users with visual impairments, accessible color palettes can make a significant difference in their experience. Interactive elements, such as buttons or links, need to stand out clearly from the rest of the design, using colors that provide strong contrast and clear visual cues.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/inclusive-dark-mode-designing-accessible-dark-themes/4-slack-visual-impairments.png\" /></p>\n<p>In the example above, Slack did an amazing job providing users with visual impairments with premade options. That way, someone can save hours of valuable time. If it wasn’t obvious by now, apps that do this find much more success in customer attraction (and retention) than those that don’t. </p>\nMaking Dark Mode A User Choice\n<p>Dark mode is often celebrated for its ability to reduce screen glare and blue light, making it more comfortable for users <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/09/design-reduced-motion-sensitivities/\">who experience certain visual sensitivities</a>, like eye strain or discomfort from bright screens. </p>\n<p>For many, this creates a more pleasant browsing experience, particularly in low-light environments. However, dark mode isn’t a perfect solution for everyone.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/inclusive-dark-mode-designing-accessible-dark-themes/5-light-mode-vs-dark-mode.png\" /></p>\n<p>Users with astigmatism, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.boia.org/blog/dark-mode-can-improve-text-readability-but-not-for-everyone\">may find it difficult to read light text on a dark background</a>. The contrast can cause the text to blur or create halos, making it harder to focus. Likewise, some users prefer dark mode for its reduced eye strain, while others may find it harder to read or simply prefer light mode.</p>\n<p>These different factors mean that <strong>adaptability</strong> is important to better accommodate users who may have certain visual sensitivities. You can <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73693983/add-button-to-switch-between-light-and-dark-mode-using-two-prefers-color-scheme\">allow users to toggle between dark and light modes</a> based on their preferences. For even greater comfort, think of providing options to customize text colors and background shades.</p>\n<p>Switching between dark and light modes should also be <strong>smooth</strong> and <strong>unobtrusive</strong>. Whether you’re working in a bright office or relaxing in a dimly lit room, the transition should never disrupt your workflow. </p>\n<p>On top of that, remembering your preferences automatically for future sessions creates a consistent and thoughtful user experience. These adjustments turn dark mode into a truly personalized feature, tailored to elevate every interaction you have with the interface.</p>\nConclusion\n<p>While dark mode offers benefits like reduced eye strain and energy savings, it still has its limits. Focusing on key elements like contrast, readability, typography, and color perception helps guarantee that your <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/04/designing-accessibility-inclusion/\">designs are inclusive and user-friendly</a> for all of your users.</p>\n<p>Offering dark mode as an optional, customizable feature empowers users to interact with your interface in a way that best suits their needs. Meanwhile, prioritizing accessibility in dark mode design creates a more equitable digital experience for everyone, regardless of their abilities or preferences. </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Articles on Smashing Magazine — For Web Designers And Developers","siteHash":"ab069ca35bf300e9db0da36f49701f66485a5b0d2db0471dfeee07cef6204939","entryHash":"4655acc931aeeedebb0160cb604422658aa0b4b7f358fd3c2c306f78f73a1c92","category":"Tech"}
