The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RT_com\">RT</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/XHNews\">Xinhua</a> Twitter accounts were previously labeled \"Russia state-affiliated media\" and \"China state-affiliated media,\" but those labels disappeared sometime yesterday or today.</p>\n<p>RT describes itself on its Twitter profile as promoting \"freedom over censorship, truth over narrative,\" and the profile now has no indication that it's controlled by the Russian government. China's Xinhua state news agency, also now unlabeled by Twitter, calls itself \"public media for the public good\" that doesn't \"yield to the pressure of ideological stigmatization and political bias.\"</p>\n<p>Other state-affiliated media outlets had their labels removed by Twitter. \"State-backed Dot Dot News posted a screenshot of its Twitter account on Friday with a caption that said: 'the label is gone!
