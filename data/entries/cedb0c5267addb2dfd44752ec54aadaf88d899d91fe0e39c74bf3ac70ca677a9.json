This two-lane road runs along the company's rocket assembly and launch facilities.</p>\n<p>Residents of South Texas use the highway primarily to travel from Brownsville and nearby towns to Boca Chica Beach, the southernmost beach in Texas. When the road is closed, no one can access or remain on the beach.</p>\n\n<p>This situation has become a logistical headache for SpaceX, which seeks road closures to move rocket hardware along the road and for tests and launches. It has also been unpleasant for nearby residents and those who enjoy the undeveloped beach.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789372#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789372&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cedb0c5267addb2dfd44752ec54aadaf88d899d91fe0e39c74bf3ac70ca677a9","category":"Tech"}
