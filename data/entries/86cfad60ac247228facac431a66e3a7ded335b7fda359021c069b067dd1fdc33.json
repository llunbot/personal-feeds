Each developer who receives a kit will be provided with two additional code-level support requests for troubleshooting code issues. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says that ‌Apple Vision Pro‌ headsets are Apple-owned development devices, and will need to stay where they are shipped in a private, secure workspace that is accessible only by the developers who were approved to work with one. Apple plans to be in regular contact with developers using the kit, and the kit will need to be returned at Apple's request. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nDevelopers can <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/visionos/developer-kit/\">apply on Apple's website</a>. Apple will collect details about each team's development skills and existing apps, with priority given to applicants creating an app that takes advantage of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a> features and capabilities. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/\">Apple Developer Program</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/24/apple-vision-pro-developer-kits-now-available/\">Apple Vision Pro Developer Kits Now Available</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-developer-kits-now-available.2396760/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"86cfad60ac247228facac431a66e3a7ded335b7fda359021c069b067dd1fdc33","category":"Apple"}
