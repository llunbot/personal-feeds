First it was the news of Kona setting up at Sea Otter, then immediately tearing down leading to news that <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/what-happened-to-kona-bikes-sea-otter/\" target=\"_blank\">the brand was for sale</a>. That was followed by news that Stages Cycling laid off all their staff and their <a href=\"https://www.bicycleretailer.com/industry-news/2024/04/24/stages-cycling-executives-join-giant-after-suit-and-apparent-shut-down\" target=\"_blank\">executives joined Giant</a>. At the same time, it was announced that Rapha was <a href=\"https://www.bicycleretailer.com/industry-news/2024/04/25/rapha-closes-office-bentonville-says-arkansas-remains-its-american\" target=\"_blank\">closing their Bentonville office</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we get big news from ENVE Composites, though from the outside, it seems like good news. The brand announced today that they are in process of being acquired by PV3 Investments, which is the family holding company of cycling enthusiast, Mark Hancock. The terms of the deal between PV3 and Amer Sports will not be released, but the move returns ownership of the brand to the U.S. after eight years.

The brand has positive momentum, and we see that it has good potential. However, after a thorough strategic evaluation, we have concluded that the next phase of development should happen under new ownership. We believe PV3 is the most suitable owner for ENVE to realize and drive its next growth phase.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ENVE Composites was founded in 2007 and is one of a small number of U.S. cycling brands to have American manufacturing. The company’s dedication to performance products and in house manufacturing has allowed it to be an innovation leader in wheels, components, and bicycles, while partnering with many of the best athletes in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, ENVE moved into its Ogden, Utah based headquarters. The 80,000 square foot building houses engineering, R&amp;D, manufacturing, sales, marketing, customer service, and finance functions that provide employment opportunities to the local community. PV3 is dedicated to maintaining ENVE’s heritage as a Utah-based manufacturer and leader in composites technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We have confidence in the direction ENVE’s management team are taking the company and we want to continue building the brand’s legacy as a performance leader and U.S. manufacturer, while providing the necessary support for continued growth,” said Mark Hancock, Principal of PV3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ENVE’s General Manager Mike Stimola stated, “This is an opportunity to take ENVE to the next level through local Utah ownership. While the current bicycle market is challenging, ENVE is growing based on our product innovation and professional team partnerships.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike Stimola was brought on by Amer Sports in January 2023 and will continue in his current role. With the acquisition complete, ENVE’s operations will continue as normal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Closing is expected to take place in the next few weeks and the parties have agreed not to disclose the transaction details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Located in Ogden, Utah, ENVE Composites is a manufacturer of handmade carbon fiber bicycle frames, rims, and components. Partnering with the world’s best athletes, ENVE combines the best composite technologies with real world athlete feedback to provide our customers with the ultimate in performance, durability, and quality.
