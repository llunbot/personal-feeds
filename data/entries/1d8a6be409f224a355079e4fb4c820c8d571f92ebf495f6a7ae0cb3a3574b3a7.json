Then came the inevitable downfall and outbreak of war as the Sith, who embraced the Dark Side of the Force, came to power. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)\"><em>Star Wars: The Acolyte</em></a> is a forthcoming new series on Disney+ that will explore those final days of the Republic as the seeds of its destruction were sown—and the streaming platform just dropped the first trailer.</p>\n<p>The eight-episode series was created by Leslye Headland, who co-created <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/happy-death-day-2-u-russian-doll-give-us-time-loops-with-a-multiverse-twist/\"><em>Russian Doll</em></a> with Natasha Lyonne and Amy Poehler. It's set at the end of the High Republic Era, about a century before the events of <em>The Phantom Menace</em>. Apparently Headland rather cheekily pitched <em>The Acolyte</em> as \"<em>Frozen</em> meets <em>Kill Bill</em>,\" which is an intriguing combination. She drew on <em>wuxia</em> martial arts films for inspiration, much like George Lucas was originally inspired by Westerns and the samurai films of Akira Kurosawa.</p>\n<p><strong>(Some spoilers for the prequel trilogy below.)</strong></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011253#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011253&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1d8a6be409f224a355079e4fb4c820c8d571f92ebf495f6a7ae0cb3a3574b3a7","category":"Tech"}
