The rumor was posted to Weibo prior to Gurman's most recent remarks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman believes that there will be a further Apple product launch in October, but expressed skepticism that an entire event will take place to introduce new devices. He said that it could be similar to the introduction of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> Pro and ‌M2‌ Max MacBook Pro models earlier this year, which were announced via press release and a short video. Gurman claimed that October could see something \"along those lines.\" \"I'm not sure they have enough to drag people down to Cupertino to watch the video like they do for this [<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>] launch,\" he added.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple last updated the ‌iPad Air‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/08/apple-unveils-new-ipad-air/\">in March 2022</a> with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip, an upgraded 12-megapixel front camera with Center Stage support, a faster USB-C port, 5G support on cellular models, and new color options. Pricing starts at $599 in the U.S. for 64GB of storage. It is unclear what <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/19/ipad-air-6-key-upgrades-to-expect/\">new features</a> the next-generation ‌iPad Air‌ will offer, but possibilities include the ‌M2‌ chip, a Thunderbolt port like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> hover, and new color options.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/10/ipad-air-6-rumored-to-launch-in-october/\">iPad Air 6 Rumored to Launch in October as Only iPad Refresh of 2023</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-air-6-rumored-to-launch-in-october-as-only-ipad-refresh-of-2023.2400947/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fa5ff3311842b0b3acc2de815e414b312d9a3a1456db3f07eef5bbc0385df5be","category":"Apple"}
