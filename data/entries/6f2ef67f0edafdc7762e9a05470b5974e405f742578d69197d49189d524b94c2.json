(Do you remember what’s unique about each of those?)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first letter <strong>M</strong> means mountain bike specific. The second letter <strong>S</strong> means short length. And the third letter is the rider position. <strong>N</strong> is neutral for all-around riding where you aren’t leaned over too forward and can still comfortably pedal uphill while seated, albeit maybe slid forward a bit more – intended for enduro, all-mountain, and technical trail riding. <strong>U</strong> is for upright riding with a higher bar:saddle position, more appropriate for ebikes where the rider will spend more time seated in the same position while pedaling uphill, on the flats, and over rolling terrain. Pro suggests there may also be a future <strong>A</strong> for aggressive positions on the bike or <strong>F</strong> for more forward-leaning bike fits. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSU-1-3-eMTB-off-road-ebike-saddle-review_muddy-tubular-stainless-steel-rails.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSU-1-3-eMTB-off-road-ebike-saddle-review_muddy-tubular-stainless-steel-rails-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"PRO MSU 1.3 eMTB off-road ebike saddle review, underside steel rails\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSU-1-3-eMTB-off-road-ebike-saddle-review_muddy-tubular-stainless-steel-rails-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSU-1-3-eMTB-off-road-ebike-saddle-review_muddy-tubular-stainless-steel-rails-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSU-1-3-eMTB-off-road-ebike-saddle-review_muddy-tubular-stainless-steel-rails-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSU-1-3-eMTB-off-road-ebike-saddle-review_muddy-tubular-stainless-steel-rails-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSU-1-3-eMTB-off-road-ebike-saddle-review_muddy-tubular-stainless-steel-rails-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSU-1-3-eMTB-off-road-ebike-saddle-review_muddy-tubular-stainless-steel-rails-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSU-1-3-eMTB-off-road-ebike-saddle-review_muddy-tubular-stainless-steel-rails-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSU-1-3-eMTB-off-road-ebike-saddle-review_muddy-tubular-stainless-steel-rails.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that is a 2-number classification that will describe the saddle’s base, rail &amp; padding construction. That first <strong>1</strong> seems to signal a lightweight carbon-reinforced nylon shell.

We’ll have to wait for more saddles to adopt the new naming convention for more clarification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>All PRO Saddles feature a 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee and like all PRO products the new PRO saddles carry a limited lifetime warranty; based on a 10-year expected lifetime.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>PRO MSN 1.3 enduro mountain bike saddle</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSN-1-3-enduro-all-mountain-bike-MTB-off-road-saddle-top.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSN-1-3-enduro-all-mountain-bike-MTB-off-road-saddle-top-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"PRO MSN 1-3 enduro MTB off-road saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSN-1-3-enduro-all-mountain-bike-MTB-off-road-saddle-top-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSN-1-3-enduro-all-mountain-bike-MTB-off-road-saddle-top-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSN-1-3-enduro-all-mountain-bike-MTB-off-road-saddle-top-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSN-1-3-enduro-all-mountain-bike-MTB-off-road-saddle-top-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSN-1-3-enduro-all-mountain-bike-MTB-off-road-saddle-top-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSN-1-3-enduro-all-mountain-bike-MTB-off-road-saddle-top-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSN-1-3-enduro-all-mountain-bike-MTB-off-road-saddle-top-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSN-1-3-enduro-all-mountain-bike-MTB-off-road-saddle-top.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>PRO MSN 1.3</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The technical mountain biking MSN is available now in this one 1.3 level spec for $150 / 120€, with tubular steel rails, a carbon-reinforced base, and a durable black-on-black polyurethane cover.

But the thicker rear padding of the MSU offers a much more comfortable tail to push against for seated ebike climbing, and just longer periods of time staying seated. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSU-1-3-eMTB-off-road-ebike-saddle-review_on-a-boat.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSU-1-3-eMTB-off-road-ebike-saddle-review_on-a-boat-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"PRO MSU 1-3 eMTB off-road ebike saddle review, on a boat\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSU-1-3-eMTB-off-road-ebike-saddle-review_on-a-boat-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSU-1-3-eMTB-off-road-ebike-saddle-review_on-a-boat-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSU-1-3-eMTB-off-road-ebike-saddle-review_on-a-boat-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSU-1-3-eMTB-off-road-ebike-saddle-review_on-a-boat-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSU-1-3-eMTB-off-road-ebike-saddle-review_on-a-boat-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PRO-MSU-1-3-eMTB-off-road-ebike-saddle-review_on-a-boat.jpg 1500w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pro MSU 1.3 is a pretty unassuming saddle with generous-looking, but firm padding. And its best trait as an ebike saddle is that it disappeared under me as I rode. I’ve only spent a few days riding it on eMTBs, but I plan now to swap one in for a more comfortable ride on my e-cargo setup back at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Next-gen-Shimano-eMTB-ebike-AutoShift-FreeShift-automatic_LinkGlide_EP-801_11sp-XT-Di2_photo-by-Dan-Milner_Santa-Cruz-Bullit-CC.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Next-gen-Shimano-eMTB-ebike-AutoShift-FreeShift-automatic_LinkGlide_EP-801_11sp-XT-Di2_photo-by-Dan-Milner_Santa-Cruz-Bullit-CC-800x444.jpg\" alt=\"Next-gen Shimano eMTB ebikes transformed with AutoShift FreeShift automatic shifting, powered by LinkGlide, EP-801 &amp; 11sp XT Di2, photo by Dan Milner, Santa Cruz Bullit CC\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Next-gen-Shimano-eMTB-ebike-AutoShift-FreeShift-automatic_LinkGlide_EP-801_11sp-XT-Di2_photo-by-Dan-Milner_Santa-Cruz-Bullit-CC-800x444.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Next-gen-Shimano-eMTB-ebike-AutoShift-FreeShift-automatic_LinkGlide_EP-801_11sp-XT-Di2_photo-by-Dan-Milner_Santa-Cruz-Bullit-CC-297x165.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Next-gen-Shimano-eMTB-ebike-AutoShift-FreeShift-automatic_LinkGlide_EP-801_11sp-XT-Di2_photo-by-Dan-Milner_Santa-Cruz-Bullit-CC-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Next-gen-Shimano-eMTB-ebike-AutoShift-FreeShift-automatic_LinkGlide_EP-801_11sp-XT-Di2_photo-by-Dan-Milner_Santa-Cruz-Bullit-CC-768x427.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Next-gen-Shimano-eMTB-ebike-AutoShift-FreeShift-automatic_LinkGlide_EP-801_11sp-XT-Di2_photo-by-Dan-Milner_Santa-Cruz-Bullit-CC-1536x853.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Next-gen-Shimano-eMTB-ebike-AutoShift-FreeShift-automatic_LinkGlide_EP-801_11sp-XT-Di2_photo-by-Dan-Milner_Santa-Cruz-Bullit-CC.jpg 1800w\" /></a><figcaption><em>photo by Dan Milner</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.pro-bikegear.com/global/\" target=\"_blank\">PRO-BikeGear.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pro-msn-enduro-msu-all-mountain-ebike-saddles/\">PRO MSN Enduro &amp; MSU eMTB Off-Road Saddles Reclassify Performance – First Rides</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"6f2ef67f0edafdc7762e9a05470b5974e405f742578d69197d49189d524b94c2","category":"Cycling"}
