This one has some patina but a great story and as Sam puts it’s “all just old as hell.”<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/IMG_20211016_183004-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Kia Ora! My name is Sam and I’m a student studying in Christchurch, New Zealand.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/IMG_20211025_124105-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/IMG_20211025_124056-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I moved to Christchurch from my hometown at the start of 2020 and overtime got to know a local legend named Steve. After my hardtail was stolen at the start of this year he lent me this road bike use, a Pertini Ten. This is also the first road bike I have ever ridden.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/IMG_20211025_124040-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>There isn’t much online about the Pertini brand but from what I can gather it was a spin-off of the Mitchell brand of bikes that were made in New Zealand starting in the ’50s. It seems most Pertini bikes (at least this) were likely to have been made sometime in the mid to late ’80s.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/IMG_20211025_124159-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Apart from the pedals and lights I’ve thrown on, everything looks original-ish (don’t quote me on that though, it’s all just old as hell).</p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong><br />\nFrame and Fork: Pertini Ten, 61cm.<br />\nRims: Araya 700c with Suntour Vx hubs<br />\nShifters: Suntour downtube shifters<br />\nCrankset: Sugino 52/42 with 170mm Super Maxy cranks<br />\nDerailleurs (F&amp;R): Suntour Vx<br />\nCassette: 14 – 24, 5 speed<br />\nBrakes: Calipers are unbranded but levers just say “Cherry”. I’ve seen them on other older bikes around town.<br />\nTires: Hutchinson Kevlar 25mm (front), Michelin Dynamic 25mm (rear)<br />\nSeatpost: Sugino SP-H<br />\nSaddle: The most uncomfortable one I’ve ever sat on<br />\nHandlebars: Winpista branded, unsure of the width but they are too narrow for me. The ‘bartape’ may as well be just a cloth bandage.<br />\nHeadset: Wouldn’t have a clue<br />\nPedals: Crankbrothers Stamp 1</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/IMG_20211025_124239-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/IMG_20211025_124324-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The saddle is terrible, the brakes are sketchy at best and the friction shifting has taken some getting used to, but it is the bike I’ve had the most fun riding ever. Perfect for getting around a very flat city. Just don’t try climbing any hills on it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/IMG_20211025_124434-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/IMG_20211025_131102-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I’m very grateful to Steve for letting me borrow this bike.
