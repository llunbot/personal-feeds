Apple’s missed that deadline as the Mac Pro is still running on Intel processors. Nearly every other Mac is now running on the second generation of Apple silicon–with the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro running on the M2, and the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro on the M2 Pro and M2 Max. There’s now a M2 and M2 Pro version of the Mac mini, and a whole new category of Mac in the Mac Studio. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That still leaves the following Macs in need of a second generation Apple silicon update. Here’s what we’re still expecting to arrive, with <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC on June 5</a> looking like a likely venue for Apple to launch some of them:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>15-inch MacBook Air</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumors of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/819516/15-inch-macbook-air-release-date-specs-rumors.html\">a larger MacBook Air</a> have been circulating for some time and 2023 could be the year we finally see a bigger 15-inch MacBook Air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? WWDC 2023</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iMac </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A M2 iMac–and we hope an M2 Pro iMac–could/should be in the pipeline at Apple. Perhaps even the revival of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">27-inch iMac Pro</a>. However, it sounds like the next iMac could be a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484743/24-inch-imac-release-date-specs-m2-m3-processor-price.html\">M3 iMac</a> and we might be waiting a little longer for that one.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? WWDC 2023</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mac Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Work is said to be underway on the Apple Silicon Mac Pro, which could feature an M2 Ultra or even an M2 Extreme (although the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1438569/mac-pro-expandability-storage-memory-processor-m2-ultra.html\">M2 Extreme is now looking unlikely</a>).

But there’s also a rumor that a larger iPad Pro could be coming. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPad mini </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A new iPad mini – seventh generation – could be coming in 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/new-ipad-mini-7-2022-release-date-price-specs.html\">iPad mini 7 rumors</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When?

Fall 2023</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New iPhones </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The arrival of a new set of iPhones in September 2023 is highly likely, but will other new iPhones arrive earlier in 2023? </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 14 camera\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 15 </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 15 (and Plus, Pro and Pro Max) is likely to arrive, like clockwork, in September 2023. In fact the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1487037/iphone-15-pro-max-ultra-design-display-camera-price-rumors.html\">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> may be renamed the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1487037/iphone-15-pro-max-ultra-design-display-camera-price-rumors.html\">iPhone 15 Ultra</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1351959/iphone-15-plus-pro-ultra-rumors-specs-release-price.html\">iPhone 15 rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? September 2023</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone SE Plus</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a long shot, but a few years ago now there were rumors that Apple could launch a bigger version of the iPhone SE Plus – which would mean that those who want a big iPhone and a Home button would have an option. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read about the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674037/iphone-se-plus-postponed-until-2021.html\">iPhone SE Plus</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When?

If Apple launches an Apple Watch Series 9 we could possibly see some Apple Watch Ultra features make their way to that device. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more about the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1472709/apple-watch-series-9-rumors-specs-features-price-release.html\">Apple Watch Series 9</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New product categories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple was never to innovate away from the products it makes right now it could be left behind as technology progresses. It’s no surprise therefore that the company is working on various new areas. We don’t expect all of these to land in 2023, but rumors suggest that some of them still could arrive sooner rather than later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1075086/apple-2023-new-products-debut.html\">New Apple products that could debut in 2023</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>AR Glasses/Mixed Reality Headset</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s made clear its interest in augmented reality, and we may hear more about its plans to make <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671552/apple-ar-glasses-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">AR Glasses</a> in 2023.

We’ve always said that a screen would make the HomePod infinitely more usable, but perhaps we are the only ones who hate having to talk to our speaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A screen would extend the uses of the HomePod beyond audio into visual – so you could watch podcasts and news reports and YouTube videos, but most usefully communicate via FaceTime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far all Apple has done is brought back the full size HomePod that it removed from sale. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: \n<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePod with screen rumours</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When?
