Joanna was picked up in 2004 by British Cycling’s Talent Team, which visited her school looking for new talent, and just four years later she won her first World Championships in the team pursuit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three more team pursuit world titles followed plus a fifth in the individual pursuit, but it was the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/olympics\" target=\"_blank\">Olympics</a> that made Joanna a household name. Riding alongside Laura Trott (latterly Kenny) and Dani King (latterly Rowe), she won two consecutive team pursuit golds, the first at London 2012 and the second at Rio 2016 Games. Retired from competition since 2017, Joanna is still firmly embedded in the sport as pundit and commentator, appearing across the BBC’s Olympic coverage this summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Joanna discusses the Olympics and the impact it had on British cycling; coming back from successes and medals to face real life; the emotional connection she still feels with riders from the commentary box; <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-news-matthew-richardson\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Richardson’s switching nationalities</a> from Aussie to Brit to compete for Team GB; plus she looks back at a stellar career that helped change the face of the sport in Britain and the popularity of women’s cycling worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interview begins at 18min 06sec.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/cyclist-magazine-podcast/episodes/118-joanna-rowsell\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 118 now on Acast</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\">all episodes</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Did you know Cyclist is also stunning monthly print magazine?
