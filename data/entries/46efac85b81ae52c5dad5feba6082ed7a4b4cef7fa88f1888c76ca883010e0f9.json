Three that we’ve ranked the highest are the Canyon Aeroad, Scott Foil and Giant Propel. Here we’ll run through and compare their key features, provide an overview of the range, specs and prices for each and help you to choose the best aero road bike for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/canyon-aeroad-cfr-review-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon Aeroad</a> first launched in 2010, with the second generation from 2014 taking on a profile that’s not dissimilar to the current fourth generation bike. Its looks typify what we’ve come to think of as an aero bike, with deep tube sections, sharp angles and dropped seatstays. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/scott-foil-rc-review\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Foil</a> (or more correctly the Scott Foil RC, where RC stands for Race Concept) meanwhile looks much more like a time trail bike with its bar extensions replaced by dropped handlebars. Its near-vertical seatpost and tucked-in rear wheel look designed for a very aggressive ride position, although as we’ll see when we compare its geometry, this is deceptive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/giant-propel-advanced-sl-0-review\" target=\"_blank\">Giant Propel</a> has undergone a transformation from the aero bike looks of its predecessor. Despite appearing to have taken the path of the lightweight/aero <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/trek-madone-2025\" target=\"_blank\">Gen 8 Trek Madone </a>and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-tarmac-sl8-review\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized Tarmac SL8</a>, it’s still the aero bike in Giant’s stable, with the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/giant-tcr-advanced-pro-road-bike-review\" target=\"_blank\">TCR</a> fulfilling the lightweight/aero mandate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Giant, Scott and Canyon have taken very different directions in designing bikes that are among the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-aero-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">best aero road bikes</a> available. How do the Foil, Propel and Aeroad compare and how can you choose between them? We’ll look at their key features, run through the complete ranges for each and their prices and suggest how to choose the best of the three aero road bikes for you.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Aeroad vs Giant Propel vs Scott Foil: Key features</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Canyon Aeroad</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Two frame grades: CF SLX and CFR</li>\n\n\n\n<li>7.07kg lowest claimed weight </li>\n\n\n\n<li>32mm tyre clearance</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Option to swap in flared aero bar ends</li>\n\n\n\n<li>25mm front and 28mm rear tyres on most specs</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Giant Propel</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Three frame grades: Advanced, Advanced Pro and Advanced SL</li>\n\n\n\n<li>6.9kg weight for top spec bike</li>\n\n\n\n<li>30mm tyre clearance</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Two piece, adjustable aero cockpit</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Seatmast on SL grade bikes</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Scott Foil</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Two frame grades: HMX and HMX SL</li>\n\n\n\n<li>7.22kg claimed weight for highest spec</li>\n\n\n\n<li>30mm tyre clearance</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can fit rear light in seatpost</li>\n\n\n\n<li>28mm tyres on most specs</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+7\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-7-970x300.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-7-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-7-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-7-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-7-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-7-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-7-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-7-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Aeroad vs Giant Propel vs Scott Foil: Aerodynamics</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/scott-foil-rc-pro-10-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Foil RC Pro bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/scott-foil-rc-pro-10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/scott-foil-rc-pro-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/scott-foil-rc-pro-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/scott-foil-rc-pro-10-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/scott-foil-rc-pro-10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/scott-foil-rc-pro-10-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/scott-foil-rc-pro-10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/scott-foil-rc-pro-10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/scott-foil-rc-pro-10-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/scott-foil-rc-pro-10.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Aero bikes obviously major on their aerodynamic performance, but direct comparisons are tricky. Other than taking bikes to a wind-tunnel or a velodrome, you can’t compare like with like. Each brand measures its bike’s aerodynamics slightly differently and each claims best-in-class aero performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the most recently updated of the three bikes, the changes in the Aeroad from its predecessor are small, so it has a bit of a last-generation aero look to it. Canyon reckoned it was onto a winning formula with the Aeroad in any case and claims the best-in-class aerodynamics crown, with as much as 3 watts shaved off the previous bike’s power figures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Foil’s frame shapes have a lot in common with the Plasma time-trial/triathlon bike, with an upright seatpost and a deep curve to the seat tube to accommodate the rear wheel. Despite this, the geometry figures are not that different from the previous generation Foil, with a similar effective seat tube angle. The wheelbase and chainstay length are actually longer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the rear of the bike features deep aero sections, Scott says that the new Foil is more comfortable than its predecessor, as well as being more aero. In part, this is due to its Syncros Duncan SL Aero CFT seatpost, which has a very deep carved-out section at its rear edge, filled in by an aero-shaped rubber section, which can be replaced by a custom rear light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, the Giant Propel has slimmed down significantly at the rear from its predecessor and now looks to have much more in common with lightweight/aero bikes such as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-tarmac-sl8-review\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized Tarmac SL8</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/ridley-falcn-rs-review\" target=\"_blank\">Ridley Falcn</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That reflects the current emphasis on front-end aerodynamics, as this is where the airflow over a bike frame is least turbulent. Once air reaches the seat tube, brands say that it’s already turbulent, so there’s less benefit to deep aero sections, which are also much harder to make compliant for ride comfort. Making the seat tube area skinnier can also reduce the frame weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The changes to the UCI rules have facilitated the focus on front-end aerodynamics too, as head tubes can be given more of a tail and fork legs can be made longer. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related

attention is bikes’ cockpits. Full integration is old news, with the round shape of exposed cables and hoses contributing drag disproportionate to their size; Pinarello reckoned that burying cables saved 5 watts between the Dogma F10 and F12.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flared handlebars are the new frontier, putting the arms significantly closer together when riding on the levers and so improving the rider’s aerodynamics. Here, Canyon offers choice with its latest CP0048 Aerocockpit. This allows you not just to adjust the bars’ width by 50mm, but also to swap out the standard handlebar drops for Aero Drops with a shallower drop and 20mm flare, although these are an additional cost extra. Canyon claims that the flared bars improve the rider’s aerodynamics by 14 watts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giant hasn’t followed this trend with its design, which has near-vertical drops. Even more surprising, there’s a separate stem and handlebars with a fairly hefty stem faceplate presented to the air, when one-piece designs are prevalent in both out-and-out aero bikes, including the Aeroad, and aero/lightweight bikes.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott’s higher spec Foils are equipped with the Creston IC SL Aero bar/stem from its Syncros component brand.

The previous generation Aeroad was also available with the CF SL grade carbon which is used for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/canyon-aeroad-ultimate-endurace-compared\" target=\"_blank\">Ultimate and Endurace</a>, but the Aeroad doesn’t currently offer this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott too offers two frame grades. The highest spec Foil Ultimate uses its HMX SL carbon fibre layup and it claims the frame weighs 915g, while all other specs are made with HMX grade carbon, for which we don’t have a frame weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giant has three frame grades on offer. The Advanced SL frameset and fork are the lightest; the frame also includes a seatmast, rather than a conventional seatpost, to save weight. Giant says that it weighs 845g. The Advanced Pro models have an Advanced Grade frameset with a conventional seatpost with a claimed weight of 940g, and the same Advanced SL fork, while Advanced grade bikes pair the same frame with an Advanced grade fork. It’s unclear how much weight difference there is between the two Giant forks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t take too much notice of frame weight comparisons – brands may not be comparing the same size frame and may or may not include paint or hardware such as mech hangers. Suffice to say that all are very light, as attested by the weights of the complete bikes shown below. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Aeroad vs Giant Propel vs Scott Foil: Groupsets</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ZFM_0129-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ZFM_0129-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ZFM_0129-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ZFM_0129-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ZFM_0129-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ZFM_0129-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ZFM_0129-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ZFM_0129-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ZFM_0129-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ZFM_0129-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ZFM_0129-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As you’d expect, each brand bolts the cream of components to its premium bikes. It’s how far down Shimano and SRAM’s groupset hierarchies that differs (none of the three currently offer a Campagnolo spec).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All Aeroad specs are electronic, with the lowest priced bikes sporting Shimano 105 Di2 and SRAM Rival AXS. The Scott Foil range too is an all-electronic affair. In contrast, Giant has a mechanical shifting redoubt, with the Propel range including one mechanical shifting option in the form of Shimano 105, with all other specs being electronic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s increasingly common for bike brands to spec a power meter on their bikes. Canyon stands out in this respect, with four of the five specs including a power meter. SRAM builds, except the lowest Rival AXS spec, have a dual sided meter, while Shimano specs have either a 4iiii single sided or a Dura-Ace double sided meter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giant too includes a power meter in its higher spec Advanced SL and Advanced Pro bikes, a mix of Dura-Ace, Giant own brand and SRAM. The Advanced grade bikes are not equipped with a power meter though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott is more meagre with power meters, only supplying one on the top spec Foil RC Ultimate and the Foil Team’s SRAM Red AXS groupsets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Aeroad vs Giant Propel vs Scott Foil: Wheels and components</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/07120913/giant-propel-cadex-25-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"giant-propel-cadex-25\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/07120913/giant-propel-cadex-25-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/07120913/giant-propel-cadex-25-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/07120913/giant-propel-cadex-25-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/07120913/giant-propel-cadex-25-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/07120913/giant-propel-cadex-25-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/07120913/giant-propel-cadex-25-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/07120913/giant-propel-cadex-25-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/07120913/giant-propel-cadex-25-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/07120913/giant-propel-cadex-25.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Giant and Scott make heavy use of their own components on their bikes. In the case of Giant, the highest specs are fitted with wheels from its Cadex performance brand, while further down the range wheels are Giant branded. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott’s equivalent is Syncros, with all specs, except the Team which has Zipp 303S wheels, including<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/syncros-capital-sl-40-wheels-review\" target=\"_blank\"> Syncros branded wheelsets</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon fits third party wheelsets to the Aeroad. Most are carbon and from DT Swiss, although the Aeroad CF SLX 8 is fitted with Zipp 404 Firecrests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since they’re unique to each bike, seatposts and bar/stems are own brand and there’s a mix of own brand and name brand saddles.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Aeroad vs Giant Propel vs Scott Foil: Geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The three brands differ in their sizing. Canyon offers seven sizes for the Aeroad, from 2XS to 2XL; Giant has five sizes for the Propel, S, M, ML, L and XL; Scott sells the Foil in seven sizes from XXS/47 to XXL/61.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comparing the three bikes, the closest sizes to Canyon’s M are the ML for the Propel and the L for the Foil.</p>\n\n\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n\t<th> </th><th>Aeroad</th><th>Propel</th><th>Foil</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Frame size</td><td>M</td><td>ML</td><td>L</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Seat tube length</td><td>531</td><td>545</td><td>542</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Seat tube angle</td><td>73.5°</td><td>73.0°</td><td>73.3°</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Head tube length</td><td>142</td><td>165</td><td>161</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Head tube angle</td><td>73.3°</td><td>73.0°</td><td>73.0°</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Effective top tube length</td><td>555</td><td>565</td><td>565</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Bottom bracket drop</td><td>70</td><td>67</td><td>70</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Chainstay length</td><td>410</td><td>405</td><td>412</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Frame reach</td><td>393</td><td>393</td><td>395</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Frame stack</td><td>560</td><td>562</td><td>568</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Wheelbase</td><td>1000</td><td>991</td><td>1000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>All figures in millimetres except angles in degrees</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All three bikes have similar reach and stack figures for these sizes. The Aeroad’s effective top tube, seat tube and head tube lengths are shorter than the Foil or Propel though. Despite appearances, the Foil has a similar seat tube angle to the Aeroad and a longer wheelbase than the other two bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Aeroad vs Giant Propel vs Scott Foil: Ranges</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Next we’ll run through the currently available UK ranges, key specs and prices for each of the three bikes.

to hold you back. They’re all fast, stiff and adequately comfortable and have benefitted from the application of their makers’ best aerodynamicists to their design. They’re all pro-level choices too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the three bikes, the Scott Foil perhaps makes the biggest statement. In our review, we concluded that it was ‘a brute of a bike that just about manages to pull its punches’. Its hefty frame shapes and curved seat tube look fast and more aggressive than its predecessor and we said that ‘its aero design and the stiffness created by those chunky tubes and compact rear triangle definitely feel like they work together to give the bike an extra gear when most of its competitors would be out of revs’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, the Giant Propel has gone the other way and we found that the changes have made the bike easier to live with. We summed up our review by saying, ‘if I were a consumer in the market for a premium race bike, I’d have a hard time looking past the Giant Propel Advanced SL 0’, concluding that ‘the new Propel might just be the most complete race bike out there’. If you’re on a budget, Giant has the widest spread of prices too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Canyon Aeroad carries forward the race-winning pedigree of its forebears, with Mathieu van der Poel riding the bike pre-launch through much of the 2023 season – and we know how successful that was, with wins at Milan-San Remo and Paris-Roubaix topped off with the World Championships. Although we stated in our review that ‘concrete performance improvements are modest, we concluded that ‘as one of the fastest bikes available, wholesale improvements to the bike’s numbers would have been somewhat unexpected’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, none of these bikes will let you down if you’re looking for an aero road bike, it’s just a question of how aggressively aero you want your bike to look, or whether you prefer your aero bike to fly more under the radar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read our full reviews of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/canyon-aeroad-cfr-review-2024\"
