The bricks don’t look like much, but they come with a lofty goal: to help stop climate change.</p>\n<p>Graphyte, a startup backed by billionaire <a href=\"https://www.graphyte.com/post/breakthrough-energy-state-of-thetransition-2023\">Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures</a>, will bury its bricks deep underground, trapping carbon there. The company bills it as the largest carbon dioxide removal project in the world.</p>\n<p>Scientists have long warned of the dire threat posed by global warming. It’s gotten so bad though that the long-sought mitigation, <a href=\"https://undark.org/2022/08/12/the-fervent-debate-over-the-best-way-to-confront-global-warming/\">cutting carbon dioxide emissions</a> from every sector of the economy, might not be enough of a fix. To stave off the worst—including large swaths of the Earth exposed to severe heat waves, water scarcity, and crop failures—some experts say there is a deep need to remove <a href=\"https://undark.org/2024/02/19/carbon-seafloor/\">previously emitted carbon</a>, too. And that can be done anywhere on Earth—even in places not known for climate-friendly policies, like Arkansas.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038257#p3\">Read 48 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038257&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Undark Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cbe8dac11302d4a4376976acf2d1bf6cbea1e9d560de034b7d3a4b6ac0e06af6","category":"Tech"}
