You get this quasi-interpretation of who they are and their interests, and I felt like he was such a unique character, with his background in the military and long-distance hikes, especially in the winter.

This region is the island’s most remote, filled with vast lava fields, expanses of black sand, and little to no wildlife or plant life due to the extremely harsh weather known to frequent the interior.

The isolation of the route was challenging at times. The amount of space that was open with no landmarks, doing 40- to 50-mile stretches with almost nothing around you. You kind of feel lost, very insignificant within that landscape.
