It is mounted horizontally in a coat closet, putting it close to my home's fiber input and also incidentally keeping our jackets gently warm. I can fit juuuuuust about one more standard rack-size device in there (maybe a rack-mount UPS?) before I have to choose between outer-wear and overly ambitious networking. Were I starting over, I might think a bit more about scalability.</p>\n<p>Along those lines, technologist and YouTube maker Jeff Geerling has launched the <a href=\"https://mini-rack.jeffgeerling.com/\">Project Mini Rack</a> page for folks who have similarly server-sized ambitions, coupled with a lack of square footage. \"I mean, if you want to cosplay as a sysadmin, you need a rack, right?\" Geerling says in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1GCIwLm3is\">the announcement video</a>. It's a keen launching point for a new \"homelab\" or \"minilab\" project, also known as bringing the networking and hardware challenges of a commercial network deployment into your home for \"fun.\"</p>\n<div><div></div><div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div>\n      Project Mini Rack announcement video, from Jeff Geerling.\n\n          </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>It's a good time fall into the compact computing space. As Geerling notes in <a href=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/project-mini-rack-compact-and-portable-homelabs\">a blog post</a> announcing the project, there's a whole lot of small-form-factor PCs on the market. You can couple them with single-board computers, power-over-Ethernet devices, and network-accessible solid state drives that allow you to stuff a whole lab into a cube you can carry around in your hands.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/project-mini-rack-wants-to-help-you-make-your-non-closet-sized-homelab-a-reality/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/project-mini-rack-wants-to-help-you-make-your-non-closet-sized-homelab-a-reality/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fef4dcf14d6c7cfec5dc33a57596b7da73f538cd74684e344f1bde78d78c1bf2","category":"Tech"}
