TDEs can be detected by the immense amounts of energy they give off. While observations of them are still pretty rare, an international team of researchers has now discovered a whopping 18 of them that previous searches had missed. Why?</p>\n<p>Many TDEs can be found in dusty galaxies. Dust obscures many wavelengths of radiation, from optical to X-rays, but long <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/08/infrared-light-reveals-hidden-portrait-beneath-1943-rene-magritte-painting/\">infrared</a> wavelengths are much less susceptible to scattering and absorption. When the team checked galaxies in the infrared, they found 18 TDEs that had eluded astronomers before.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001361#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001361&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"92a3f6b0842f906008cc697a5bb38c4ae73bd4063920fb89c23584af56ee4d0a","category":"Tech"}
