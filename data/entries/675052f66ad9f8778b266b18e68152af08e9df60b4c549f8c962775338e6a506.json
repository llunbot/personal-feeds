However, despite dismissing the notification and having automatic updates turned off, affected users said their Mac proceeded to install macOS Sonoma regardless. Apple began showing the notification to users on January 10, according to <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613\">Aaron Perris</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe underlying cause of the issue is unclear, and an Apple spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is possible to downgrade a Mac to an older macOS version by using a bootable installer to erase and install the older version and then restoring your data from a Time Machine backup. Always make sure to back up your data before downgrading a Mac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo review your Mac's update settings, open the System Settings app, click General â†’ Software Update, and click the info symbol next to Automatic Updates.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe will update this report if new information becomes available.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/\">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-ventura.239\">macOS Ventura</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243\">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/some-macs-auto-updating-to-macos-sonoma/\">Some Macs Auto-Updating to macOS Sonoma Without User Permission</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-macs-auto-updating-to-macos-sonoma-without-user-permission.2417410/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"675052f66ad9f8778b266b18e68152af08e9df60b4c549f8c962775338e6a506","category":"Apple"}
