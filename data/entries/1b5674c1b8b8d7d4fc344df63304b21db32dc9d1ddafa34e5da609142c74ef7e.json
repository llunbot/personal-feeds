Either way, there was reportedly a team at Google working on the next flagship Pixel-branded tablet, and now, seemingly due to profitability concerns, that work is over. At least until, maybe, a third Pixel Tablet in the future.</p>\n<p>The Pixel Tablet, released last fall, was generally regarded as Google's second re-entry into the tablet market that the iPad all but owns. As such, it sought to distinguish itself from Apple's slab by launching with a home-friendly dock and speaker cradle, taking on the appearance of a big smart home display when docked to it.</p>\n<p>While there are no public sales figures, the device has not kick-started a resurgence of interest in Android tablets beyond the steady sales of Amazon's Kindle Fire devices based on a Google-less fork of Android.
