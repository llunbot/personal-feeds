All the company needed was one breakout hit to put the service on the map.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the quality was good, none of the shows got that “everyone is talking about it” quality until, almost a year after the debut of Apple TV+, one of the shows that <em>weren’t</em> very heavily promoted became a runaway hit. Combing niceness and good cheer with soccer seems like a recipe that could never succeed in the U.S., but Ted Lasso managed to charm everyone just the same. The show immediately became the most-watched show on Apple TV+. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first season received 20 Emmy nominations, and it won seven. The second season also got 20 nominations and won four. After a long break, <em>Ted Lasso</em> is finally back for its third, and maybe final, season. Here’s everything we know about it so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When is ‘Ted Lasso’ Season 3 streaming?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The third season of “Ted Lasso” debuted with the first episode on Wednesday, March 15. New episodes will follow weekly on a Wednesday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that sounds strange to you, it is. Apple TV+ shows generally debut on Fridays, including previous seasons of “Ted Lasso.” “Ted Lasso”‘s third season will be the first mid-week show on the service.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How many episodes will there be?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be 12 episodes in <em>Ted Lasso</em> Season 3, just like Season 2, which means the finale will air on May 31. Here is the episode list, as they are announced: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Episode 1, “Smells Like Mean Spirit,” aired on Wednesday, March 15</li><li>Episode 2, “(I Don’t Want to Go to) Chelsea” aired on Wednesday, March 22</li><li>Episode 3, “4-5-1” airs on Wednesday, March 29</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>‘Ted Lasso’ Season 3 trailer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday, February 27, Apple released the first trailer for the third season of “Ted Lasso,” featuring the Rolling Stones classic, “You Can’t Always Get What You Want.” It spotlights all of the characters we already know and doesn’t feature much in the way of any surprising story developments.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where can I watch ‘Ted Lasso’ Season 3?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ted Lasso</em> is exclusively available on <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233186/apple-tv-plus-faq.html\">Apple TV+</a>, Apple’s subscription service. You don’t need Apple TV hardware–the service is available on lots of streaming devices, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673435/airplay-compatible-tvs-that-have-apple-tv-build-in-guide.html\">smart TVs</a>, game consoles, and mobile devices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can subscribe to Apple TV+ on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://tv.apple.com&amp;xcust=1-1-1512839-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s website here</a>, or via the Apple TV app on your device.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Open the Apple TV app on your device.</li><li>Click on Apple TV+.</li><li>Subscribe or select the trial offer if available.</li><li>Sign in with your Apple ID and password.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>What does Apple TV+ cost?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple charges $6.99/£6.99 per month for its streaming service following a 7-day free trial. However, if you buy an Apple device, you get three months free. There are lots of other ways to get <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673723/how-to-get-apple-tv-plus-free.html\">Apple TV+ for free</a> for a few months. Additionally, Apple also <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675793/what-is-free-on-apple-tv.html\">puts shows up for free</a> on Apple TV from time to time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/231231/how-to-cancel-a-subscription-on-ios.html\">cancel your Apple TV+ subscription</a> at any time, so you could just pay for a month, watch the show, and then cancel your subscription.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can I watch ‘Ted Lasso’ without an Apple TV?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t need an Apple TV set-top box to watch Apple TV+ shows, nor do you need an Apple product: the Apple TV app is available on a number of non-Apple devices including streaming devices, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673435/airplay-compatible-tvs-that-have-apple-tv-build-in-guide.html\">smart TVs</a>, game consoles, and mobile devices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cheapest way to get access to Apple TV is to use an Amazon Fire Stick Lite, $29.99/£34.99 from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/fire-tv-stick-lite/dp/B07YNLBS7R/ref=sr_1_1?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon US</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/fire-tv-stick-lite-with-alexa-voice-remote-lite/dp/B091G31KSJ/ref=sr_1_2?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon UK</a>.

Despite being promoted to the Premier League, longtime Richmond coach Nate Shelley left the club to become the new manager of rival West Ham United.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s ‘Ted Lasso’ Season 3 about?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how Apple describes the third season plot: In the third season of <em>Ted Lasso</em>, the newly-promoted AFC Richmond faces ridicule as media predictions widely peg them as last in the Premier League and Nate, now hailed as the “wonder kid,” has gone to work for Rupert at West Ham United. In the wake of Nate’s contentious departure from Richmond, Roy Kent steps up as assistant coach, alongside Beard. Meanwhile, while Ted deals with pressures at work, he continues to wrestle with his own personal issues back home, Rebecca is focused on defeating Rupert, and Keeley navigates being the boss of her own PR agency. Things seem to be falling apart both on and off the pitch, but Team Lasso is set to give it their best shot anyway.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ted-lasso-season-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Ted Lasso season 4 image\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ted-lasso-season-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ted-lasso-season-4.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ted-lasso-season-4.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ted-lasso-season-4.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ted-lasso-season-4.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ted-lasso-season-4.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ted-lasso-season-4.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ted-lasso-season-4.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /><figcaption>Nick Mohammed and Jason Sudeikis in Season 3 of “Ted Lasso,” premiering March 15. </figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will this be the last season of <em>Ted Lasso</em>?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It looks like it! In an <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://deadline.com/2023/03/jason-sudeikis-ted-lasso-season-3-spoilers-series-finale-spinoffs-1235280998/&amp;xcust=1-1-1512839-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">interview with Deadline</a>, the show’s star, Jason Sudeikis, said, “This is the end of this story that we wanted to tell, that we were hoping to tell, that we loved to tell.” Sudeikis does seem open to the idea of spinoff series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brett Goldstein, who plays Roy Kent and is also a writer and producer on the series, was quoted in a piece in The Times U.K. as saying that the show was always planned as three seasons, a sentiment echoed by Sudeikis and Brendan Hunt (coach Beard). When asked if season three would be the last, he said, “We are writing it like that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in none of Apple’s promotional material is season 3 hailed as the grand finale for <em>Ted Lasso</em>. However, Apple also hasn’t announced that the show has been picked up for a fourth season, which also seems odd given the show’s popularity and the rumors about the final season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It appears that Apple and the show’s creators were perhaps not prepared for how successful and beloved the show would be, and it would likely only take some small changes to the Season 3 finale to leave the door open for further seasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where can I buy ‘Ted Lasso’ merch?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want an AFC Richmond jersey, you can buy one at the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://wbshop.com/collections/ted-lasso&amp;xcust=1-1-1512839-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">official Ted Lasso merchandise store</a>.
