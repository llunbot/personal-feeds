That's gotten some people talking about the possibility that we're on the cusp of AGI, or artificial general intelligence. While some of this is marketing fanfare, enough people in the field are taking the idea seriously that it warrants a closer look.</p>\n<p>Many arguments come down to the question of how AGI is defined, which people in the field can't seem to agree upon. This contributes to estimates of its advent that range from \"it's practically here\" to \"we'll never achieve it.\" Given that range, it's impossible to provide any sort of informed perspective on how close we are.</p>\n<p>But we do have an existing example of AGI without the \"A\"â€”the intelligence provided by the animal brain, particularly the human one. And one thing is clear: The systems being touted as evidence that AGI is just around the corner do not work at all like the brain does. That may not be a fatal flaw, or even a flaw at all. It's entirely possible that there's more than one way to reach intelligence, depending on how it's defined. But at least some of the differences are likely to be functionally significant, and the fact that AI is taking a very different route from the one working example we have is likely to be meaningful.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/ai-versus-the-brain-and-the-race-for-general-intelligence/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/ai-versus-the-brain-and-the-race-for-general-intelligence/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"48f1951628fe1675c64d227cbaac4e199e8a2ef0263a941c33f67e4f7c0c6d27","category":"Tech"}
