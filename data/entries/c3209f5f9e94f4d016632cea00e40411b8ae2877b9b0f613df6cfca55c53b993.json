The helmet uses two layers of foam to protect you against different impact speeds and employs a MIPS liner too. It was given a five-star rating by the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/safest-road-mtb-helmet/\">Virginia Tech Helmet Ratings</a> project.</p>\n<p>Wearing the A3 out on the trail, there is a decent breeze over your head and the magnetic visor doesn’t rattle around as on some other helmets.

This is known as in-moulding and provides protection against minor bumps and scratches that would otherwise damage the EPS.</p>\n<p>On cheaper helmets, this tends to be limited to the top and sides of the helmet. More expensive, fully in-moulded helmets extend the plastic protection down and around the rim, making it much more effective at fending off damage.</p>\n<h3>Ventilation</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The low weight is thanks to, in part at least, the 23 vents and deep internal channelling.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>While the extra coverage of trail-style helmets is more than welcome, it does get in the way of airflow, which can mean a much warmer and sweatier head in hot weather or when you’re pushing really hard.</p>\n<p>Happily, thanks to the increasingly clever use of materials and design, it’s now possible to make a lid that’s almost as cool as a conventional design.</p>\n<p>Having lots of vents is important, but it’s the internal channels that help airflow in through the front, over the head and out the back that makes all the difference.</p>\n<p>Look for big vents on the front and rear, with deep channels on the inside of the lid.</p>\n<h3>Comfort</h3>\n<p>How well a helmet fits will depend on the size and shape of your head. Many people tend to get on with certain brands that use a particular shape, but finding the right one is very much a case of trial and error.</p>\n<p>If possible, bearing in mind the latest Covid-19 guidance, go to your local bike shop to see how you get on with different lids or ask your friends if you can try theirs.<span><br /></span></p>\n<p>The main thing is to ensure you can get the helmet sitting securely on your head so there are no pressure points or undue movement.</p>\n<p>Most helmets will have a retention system of some kind to allow you to adjust how tightly it fits onto your head. Many of these will tighten and loosen around the circumference of the head, although some also adjust in other ways.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s a generous amount of padding in this helmet for comfort and to absorb sweat when you’re working hard.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robin Weaver</i></span></div>\n<p>However it works, make sure you can operate the system easily in gloves and that it doesn’t trap hair or pinch flesh.</p>\n<p>Also ensure that you can adjust the straps to get a solid fit that’s not restrictive and that when fully adjusted you have a clear, unobstructed view, especially when you’re in an aggressive, head-down riding position.</p>\n<p>Check that the peak can be adjusted so that it keeps the sun out of your eyes without getting in the way or flapping about when you ride. If you like to ride wearing glasses, make sure they fit comfortably with the lid.</p>\n<h3>Weight</h3>\n<p>While weight might seem like a minor consideration compared with a helmet’s other characteristics, a lightweight helmet will be a much more pleasant place to be after a long day on the bike.</p>\n<p>A light lid is much less likely to move about as you ride, too.</p>\n<h3>Convertibility</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some helmets, such as the Switchblade, have removable chin bars.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A number of helmets on the market now come with a chin guard that can be removed. This is largely in response to the growth in enduro racing, where long climbs benefit an open-face lid to help you breathe and stay cool, while gnarly descents mean the additional protection from a full-face-style lid is desirable.</p>\n<p>With a removable chin guard, riders get the best of both worlds.</p>\n<div>\n<p>The compromise is often weight because, if the helmet has full ASTM downhill certification (so it can be used as a DH race helmet), there needs to be extra protection built in. Not all of the convertible helmets meet this standard, though.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> In open-face mode, the amount of coverage coupled with the MIPS liner should keep your head well-protected.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Whether you choose a convertible helmet is up to you, but we’re definitely seeing more on the trails these days.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Anything else I might need to know?</h3>\n<p>If you love to record and share your rides online, then you’ll be pleased to know that more and more manufacturers are integrating removable camera mounts into their helmets.</p>\n<p>These allow a secure fitting for your camera, but also mean you can go back to having an unfettered helmet when you want to.</p>\n<p>Many enduro-style lids also allow you to use goggles to provide almost impregnable eye protection. Look for helmets with a peak that lifts up high enough for you to be able to fit the goggles underneath and a strap of some kind at the back to keep them secure.</p>","author":"Alex Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"c3209f5f9e94f4d016632cea00e40411b8ae2877b9b0f613df6cfca55c53b993","category":"Cycling"}
