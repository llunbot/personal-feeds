It started with today’s release of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2626371/really-the-new-ipad-air-has-a-new-chip-and-thats-it.html\">M3 iPad Air</a> (and the new Apple Intelligence-incapable <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2626469/odd-new-ipad-gets-a-faster-chip-and-more-storage-but-not-apple-intelligence.html\">iPad</a>) but it doesn’t end there. According to a <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1896952051386769851\">post</a> by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the Air releases continue on Wednesday, when Apple will announce the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">M4 MacBook Air</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1896952051386769851\"><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gurman-m4-macbook-air.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"gurman M4 MacBook Air\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gurman-m4-macbook-air.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gurman-m4-macbook-air.jpg?resize=300%2C254&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gurman-m4-macbook-air.jpg?resize=768%2C651&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gurman-m4-macbook-air.jpg?resize=1200%2C1017&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gurman-m4-macbook-air.jpg?resize=1536%2C1301&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gurman-m4-macbook-air.jpg?resize=2048%2C1735&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1017\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</a></figure><a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1896952051386769851\" target=\"_blank\">X/Mark Gurman</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Today’s iPad releases occurred at 6 a.m. Pacific/2 p.m. UTC, so set your alarm clocks if you want to be there when the release happens. If the iPad release is any indication, then preorders will probably be available tomorrow, with shipments beginning on March 12.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides a new M4 chip, the new MacBook Air is rumored to get the same 12MP Center Stage camera as the MacBook Pro. There may be some other minor updates, but we’re not expecting any major changes to the design or display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also rumored for release sometime this spring is a new AirTag and the M4 Ultra processor for the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2204696/m3-mac-studio-design-processor-specs-price.html\">Mac Studio</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347010/new-mac-pro-2023.html\">Mac Pro</a>. It’s not clear whether any of those products will also launch this week.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e3d23b580c12f67441e85eef971175098ee76d28b90fdd139c2728b06dc6d93d","category":"Apple"}
