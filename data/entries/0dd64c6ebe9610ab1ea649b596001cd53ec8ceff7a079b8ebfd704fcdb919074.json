Walmart Plus subscribers will get early access to this sale, starting at 3 p.m. ET, and in-store shopping will begin on November 12 at 5 a.m.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><strong>Wednesday, November 10</strong> - 7 p.m. ET online (3 p.m ET for Walmart+ members)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>Friday, November 12</strong> - 5 a.m. local time in stores</li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWalmart has yet to reveal specifics about its sales or store hours for the week of Black Friday, but we'll be sure to update this article and our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/black-friday/\">Black Friday Roundup</a> when they do share more details.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Early Black Friday - Deals For Days Event</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nThis event has numerous deals, including savings on TVs, computers, AirPods, Keurig machines, portable storage, smart home products, and more. We've highlighted some of the best upcoming deals below, but be sure to <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/153062/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2F\">visit Walmart.com to browse the full ad</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>AirPods 2</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the standouts in this sale is a new all-time low price on the <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/153062/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441\">AirPods 2 with Charging Case</a>, priced at $89. This model originally cost $159, and in the past the lowest price we've ever tracked was around $99. If you're okay with investing in an older model, this is a great sale price for the AirPods, which always make a solid holiday gift.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/AirPods-Holiday-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nShoppers should remember that the AirPods 2 deal is only available to Walmart+ subscribers this afternoon. The $89 price tag will open up to everyone else later tonight at 7 p.m. ET.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/153062/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$70 OFF</div>AirPods 2 for $89</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis also beats the current going rate of the AirPods 2 at retailers like Amazon by about $30.
