That’s the conclusion of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49269-y\">new research</a> colleagues and I have published on the Juneau Icefield, which straddles the Alaska-Canada border near the Alaskan capital of Juneau.</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2022, I skied across the flat, smooth, and white plateau of the icefield, accompanied by <a href=\"https://juneauicefield.org/\">other researchers</a>, sliding in the tracks of the person in front of me under a hot sun. From that plateau, around 40 huge, interconnected glaciers descend towards the sea, with hundreds of smaller glaciers on the mountain peaks all around.</p>\n<p>Our work, now published in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49269-y\">Nature Communications</a>, has shown that Juneau is an example of a climate “feedback” in action: as temperatures are rising, less and less snow is remaining through the summer (technically: the “end-of-summer snowline” is rising). This in turn leads to ice being exposed to sunshine and higher temperatures, which means more melt, less snow, and so on.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035391#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035391&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"The Conversation","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cb5ab123b3e03c2187c93a4394b34b87dc8779424f9af9b37053c7e37c7d5f05","category":"Tech"}
