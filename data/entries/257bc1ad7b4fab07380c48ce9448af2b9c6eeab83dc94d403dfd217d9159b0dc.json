This drop has been attributed to fierce competition from domestic brands such as Huawei, Vivo, Oppo, Honor, and Xiaomi. Huawei, in particular, has seen a resurgence in the high-end smartphone market, fueled by advanced chips produced entirely in China.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCanalys reported that the overall Chinese smartphone market experienced a 10% year-on-year growth in the second quarter of 2024, with shipments exceeding 70 million units. Vivo reclaimed the number one spot by shipping 13.1 million units, capturing a 19% market share. Oppo followed with 11.3 million units, Honor with 10.7 million units, and Huawei with 10.6 million units. Xiaomi re-entered the top five with a 17% year-on-year increase, shipping 10 million units. In contrast, Apple's shipments dropped to 9.7 million units, representing a 14% market share.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe increased competition and market dynamics in China have posed significant challenges for Apple. The company's market share decreased from 16% in the previous year to 14%, pushing it from third to sixth place. Despite promotional efforts, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/15/apple-offers-rare-iphone-discounts-china/\">significant discounts</a> of up to 23%, Apple has struggled to maintain its market position. The competitive landscape has been further complicated by the overall growth of local vendors, which have benefited from their localized supply chains and strong brand loyalty among Chinese consumers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/new-apple-lab-in-china-to-test-products/\">recently visited China</a>, meeting with officials in Beijing and Shenzhen to reinforce Apple's commitment to the Chinese market. Canalys analyst Lucas Zhong emphasized the importance of the company localizing Apple Intelligence for China within the next year to regain market share. The anticipated release of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> lineup later this year is also expected to drive demand and potentially improve Apple's market position.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/canalys/\">Canalys</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/26/apple-drops-to-sixth-place-in-china/\">Apple Drops to Sixth Place in China's Smartphone Market</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-drops-to-sixth-place-in-chinas-smartphone-market.2432269/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"257bc1ad7b4fab07380c48ce9448af2b9c6eeab83dc94d403dfd217d9159b0dc","category":"Apple"}
