They also want to keep as many frames on the trail as possible AND support a good cause; in this case, <a href=\"https://ridebristol.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Ride Bristol</a>.</p>\n<p>So, the Bristol-based framebuilders have created a trade-in scheme that most benefits its old-school, early-days customers.

In the latest video from Starling, Joe breaks it all down.</p>\n<p>You can also read about it on the <a href=\"https://www.starlingcycles.com/frame-trade-in-upgrade/\" target=\"_blank\">Starling Cycles website</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/upgrade-your-starling-cycles-frame/\">Upgrade Your Old School Starling Cycles Frame AND Support A Good Cause</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"f804a7da4f29d4a8337516b73a886f8930987aef6521807a5f0ff06d5eae857e","category":"Cycling"}
