With the high court's ruling, the settlement talks will have to begin again, with the outcome and possible payouts to plaintiffs uncertain.</p>\n<p>Between 1999 and 2019, as nearly 250,000 Americans died from prescription opioid overdoses, members of the Sackler family siphoned approximately $11 billion from the pharmaceutical company they ran, Purdue Pharma, maker of OxyContin, a highly addictive and falsely marketed pain medication, according to the high court's ruling. In 2007, amid the nationwide epidemic of opioid addiction and overdoses, Purdue affiliates pleaded guilty in federal court to falsely branding OxyContin as less addictive and less abusive than other pain medications. Out of fear of future litigation, the Sacklers began a \"milking program,\" the high court noted, draining Purdue of roughly 75 percent of its assets.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034031#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034031&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cd2ebe75c3a475f482892f583b08967c1337929b2ed57e8b219d7ba471032415","category":"Tech"}
