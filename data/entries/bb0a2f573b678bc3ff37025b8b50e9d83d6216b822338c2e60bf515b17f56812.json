The small, 3 cm-long fish likes to chew the tails off fish and tadpoles and consume the eggs of other freshwater denizens.</p>\n<p>Being an invasive species, the fish are mostly fearless, and they have no predators in the places they've colonized. However, an international team of biologists and engineers has found a solution to the problem: a robot.</p>\n<p>Back in 2019, Giovanni Polverino—currently a post-doc at the University of Western Australia—and his colleagues developed a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2019-07-robotic-fish-native-species-invasive.html\">mechanical largemouth</a> bass that proved to be effective in scaring mosquitofish. In North America, juvenile largemouth bass regularly make meals of the species; the primal fear of this predator has stuck with the mosquito fish as they traversed the globe.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1821343#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1821343&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Doug Johnson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bb0a2f573b678bc3ff37025b8b50e9d83d6216b822338c2e60bf515b17f56812","category":"Tech"}
