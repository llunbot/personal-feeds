Cascada knows this and that’s why their newest jersey is more like a lightweight merino t-shirt. These new jerseys are 50% merino and 50% polyester, this ensures your jersey will last longer and be resilient to moths. For €80,00, you can pick between either sage or rust for a jersey that is made in Italy.
