This was a hotly contested move during the beta process, where it was rife with problems. But Apple listened and made a host of major changes before the iOS 15 final release, including the ability to revert the bar to the top of the screen in Settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, two years later, Safari’s biggest rival is preparing to make the same change. Google is currently testing the ability to move the Omnibox (its name for the address-and-search bar) to the bottom of the screen. You’ll have to enable it by using a feature flag rather than the app settings for now, and it’s still in beta. Eventually, it is expected to graduate to a regular option or possibly even the default.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To enable the bottom Omnibox in <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-chrome/id535886823&amp;xcust=1-1-2041778-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Chrome on iOS</a>, enter the following into the address bar and tap Go:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre><code>chrome://flags/#bottom-omnibox-steady-state</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>From the resulting screen, look for the <strong>Bottom Omnibox (steady)</strong> setting, which should be highlighted. Change the selection to <strong>Enabled</strong>. Then close Chrome and relaunch it. Your Omnibox should now be on the bottom.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chrome-bottom-bar-how-to.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Chrome omnibox how to\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chrome-bottom-bar-how-to.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 4149w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chrome-bottom-bar-how-to.jpg?resize=300%2C210&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chrome-bottom-bar-how-to.jpg?resize=768%2C538&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chrome-bottom-bar-how-to.jpg?resize=1200%2C841&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chrome-bottom-bar-how-to.jpg?resize=1536%2C1077&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chrome-bottom-bar-how-to.jpg?resize=2048%2C1436&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"841\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Google has experimented with a bottom address bar in Android over the years, but it never became a feature in the browser. It’s not clear whether Google is planning to offer this new bottom omnibox in Chrome for Android or if it will ever become a main feature on iOS.</p>\n\nMobile Apps</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"12628d66ca0c0965e1791fc12d99407e6bf43f09f837a715eddeed124a0741f6","category":"Apple"}
