[credit:\n                              Motorola                            ]\n                      </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n<p>Motorola is pumping out a new set of phones today. The most interesting is the new mid-range Moto G, and it also sounds like the flagship <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/motorola-still-makes-flagship-phones-meet-the-edge-40-pro/\">Motorola Edge 40 Pro</a> is getting repackaged for the US as the Motorola Edge Plus.</p>\n<p>First up, the mid-ranger. The Moto G hits a pricing sweet spot at $250 and will arrive in stores sometime this month. For $250, you get a 6.5-inch 1600×720 LCD with a surprising 120 Hz refresh rate, 4GB RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 5000 mAh battery. The SoC is a Snapdragon 480+—that's two ARM Cortex A76 cores and six A55 cores build on an 8 nm process with an Adreno 619 GPU.</p>\n<p>There's a fingerprint reader somewhere, but Motorola's spec sheet doesn't say where. The phone has a 3.5 mm headphone jack, a microSD slot, Wi-Fi 5 support, and 15 W charging. The body is plastic, a big downside is that there's no NFC, and while the \"water-repellent\" design can protect against \"accidental spills,\" it's not submersible. For cameras, you get a 48 MP main sensor and a just-for-looks 2 MP \"macro\" lens. The front camera is 8 MP.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935946#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935946&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"dca88186cf48389de8e999b7a73c4fe5205c89922673d5307c777c69e87de235","category":"Tech"}
