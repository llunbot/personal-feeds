{"title":"iOS 18.3 Tweaks Calculator App Functionality","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/ios-18-3-calculator-app/","date":1737501257000,"content":"With iOS 18.3, Apple made a small but meaningful change to the way the Calculator app works, reintroducing repeating operations. When you tap the equals sign twice, the app will now repeat the last mathematical operation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Calculator-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nSo, for example, if you type in 5x5 and tap the equals sign, you'll get 25 as a result. If you hit the equals sign again, it will multiply 25x5, and will continue multiplying by 5 every time you tap the equals symbol.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRepeating operations were an option in the Calculator app prior to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, but ‌iOS 18‌ removed the functionality. Users who have missed the feature will get it back after updating to iOS 18.3. Being able to repeat operations is useful for calculating compound interest. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nNote that this feature has also been missing in macOS 15, but the macOS 15.3 update reinstates it. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/ios-18-3-calculator-app/\">iOS 18.3 Tweaks Calculator App Functionality</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-3-tweaks-calculator-app-functionality.2447854/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5bd5347a4494b0f91e9193979884b870493482b3a4d0d4f72fa9cd896c822f6a","category":"Apple"}
