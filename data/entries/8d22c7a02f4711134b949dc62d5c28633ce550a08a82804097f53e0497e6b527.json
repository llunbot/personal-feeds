At least that's one possible scenario for the existence of a game board <a href=\"https://arkeonews.net/500-year-old-board-game-discovered-carved-into-a-stone-slab-in-a-polish-castle/\">recently discovered</a> by archaeologists in the castle ruins; it's also possible the board could have been carved by children or by servants after the castle was completed, or it may have been meant as a symbolic message.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/archaeologists-discovered-a-4000-year-old-board-game-at-a-dig-in-oman/\">previously reported</a>, there is archaeological evidence for various kinds of <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/best-board-games-ancient-world-180974094/\">board games from all over the world</a> dating back millennia: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senet\">Senet</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehen_(game)\">Mehen</a> in ancient Egypt, for example, or a strategy game called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludus_latrunculorum\">ludus latrunculorum</a> (\"game of mercenaries\") favored by Roman legions. A 4,000-year-old board discovered last year at an archaeological site in Oman's Qumayrah Valley might be a precursor to an ancient Middle Eastern game known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur\">Royal Game of Ur</a> (or the Game of Twenty Squares), a two-player game that may have been one of the precursors to backgammon (or was simply replaced in popularity by backgammon). Like backgammon, it's essentially a race game in which players compete to see who can move all their pieces along the board before their opponent.</p>\n<p>This latest discovery isn't quite as old as that in terms of the actual carved board, but the game could be just as ancient. According to archaeologist Tomasz Olszacki, it's a two-person strategy board game called Mill, also known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_men%27s_morris\">Nine Men's Morris</a>, Merels, or \"cowboy checkers\" in North America. The earliest-known Mill game board was found carved into the roofing slabs of an Egyptian temple at Kurna, which likely predates the Common Era. Historians believe it was well-known to the Romans, who may have learned of the game through trade routes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968641#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968641&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8d22c7a02f4711134b949dc62d5c28633ce550a08a82804097f53e0497e6b527","category":"Tech"}
