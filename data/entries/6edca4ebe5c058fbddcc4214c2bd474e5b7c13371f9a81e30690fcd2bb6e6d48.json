But OceanGate is far from the first outfit to use off-the-shelf or slightly modified gaming control hardware to power expensive heavy machinery well outside of the gaming realm.</p>\n<p>MRI analysis firm BodyViz, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20141212-press-x-press-y-fire-laser\">told the BBC</a> that an Xbox controller provided a much more intuitive way to “rotate, pan, zoom or fly-through a patient's virtual anatomy” than the previously standard mouse-and-keyboard interface. And <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/video-games-help-nasa-control-robots-rovers-flna977651\">NASA has used an Xbox Kinect as an interface to control complex rovers</a> like the six-limbed ATHLETE (All-Terrain Hex-Limbed Extra-Terrestrial Explorer).</p>\n<p>But international militaries have shown some of the most avid and continued interest in adapting game-control interfaces for decidedly non-entertainment uses. In 2014, the US Navy was <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140411010917/http://www.onr.navy.mil/en/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2014/Laser-Weapon-Ready-For-Deployment.aspx\">promoting its use of \"a video game-like controller\"</a> in a laser weapon prototype, for example. And in 2018, the USS <em>Colorado</em> attack submarine was handing Navy sailors an Xbox controller <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/03/16/attack-submarine-colorado-xbox-controllers-included-join-fleet/431719002/\">to operate its periscope-like photonic masts</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1949093#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1949093&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6edca4ebe5c058fbddcc4214c2bd474e5b7c13371f9a81e30690fcd2bb6e6d48","category":"Tech"}
