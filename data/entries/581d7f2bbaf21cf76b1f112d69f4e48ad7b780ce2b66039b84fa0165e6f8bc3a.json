What was realistic? What was possible? Now we know.</p>\n<p>10 days, with a warm-down stage on the Champs Elysees – as per tradition.</p>\n<p>Jack dreamt up The Amazing Chase three years ago, and it has taken until 2021 to complete. What he didn’t quite expect was the rollercoaster he’d go through while doing it. Simple factors like the weather and fatigue are easy to talk about (and important to acknowledge), but also the internal battles that aren’t always easy to see, much less discuss, work through and write about.</p>\n<p>When we interviewed Jack the day before he rolled out, we asked him if he thought the challenge would be difficult. What we didn’t expect him to reply was ‘no’. What he told us was that when you’ve suffered through depression and darkness and loneliness, riding a bike 350km a day is manageable. You pedal, and you keep on pedaling. And like opening up about mental health issues, you make it out the other side stronger and more experienced.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/jacks-amazing-chase/\">Read More</a>","author":"Wahoo Fitness","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"581d7f2bbaf21cf76b1f112d69f4e48ad7b780ce2b66039b84fa0165e6f8bc3a","category":"Cycling"}
