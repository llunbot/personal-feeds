When it was <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-look-pivots-new-les-27-5-hardtail-and-vault-cyclocross-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">first introduced</a> in 2015, it was a cyclocross-specific model that included hidden cantilever bosses, and quick release dropouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn’t long until the Vault shifted its focus to a more versatile focus with geometry designed for cross, gravel, or road. Essentially an all-road bike with clearance for up to 38mm tires. The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2017-pivot-vault-becomes-one-bike-cyclocross-gravel-drop-bar-quiver/\" target=\"_blank\">second-gen Vault</a> continued with that theme, but it was the third-gen where things started to get more interesting. The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/all-new-pivot-vault-gravel-bike-lets-you-customize-your-seatpost-flex/\" target=\"_blank\">Vault Gen 3</a> offered comparatively massive 47mm tire clearance and introduced the Pivot Iso Flex system. Gen 3 was still billed as a do-everything drop bar bike, but it was skewing more and more towards gravel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault_Blank-Bottles-Asset-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"913\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault_Blank-Bottles-Asset-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Pivot Vault Gravel Bike green\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault_Blank-Bottles-Asset-jpeg.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault_Blank-Bottles-Asset-297x181.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault_Blank-Bottles-Asset-120x73.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault_Blank-Bottles-Asset-768x467.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>(All Photos/Pivot Cycles)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us to the latest Vault Gen 4. The latest iteration of the Vault is still a fast ride worthy of the Pivot name, but it is first and foremost a gravel bike built to maximize versatility and comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pivot left almost nothing untouched for the new bike and despite adding more features to the bike and making the frames longer, Pivot worked their engineering magic to make the frames even lighter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Improved Geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pivot was quick to point out that the new Vault is not a mountain bike in gravel clothes, but it is a longer, slacker, and taller bike with “progressive gravel geometry.” This should allow riders to drop stem lengths by 10-20mm, and increase confidence on descents and corners without sacrificing efficiency. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Pivot-Vault-2024-Geo-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1187\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Pivot-Vault-2024-Geo-1536x1187.webp\" alt=\"Pivot Vault 2024 geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Pivot-Vault-2024-Geo-1536x1187.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Pivot-Vault-2024-Geo-297x230.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Pivot-Vault-2024-Geo-120x93.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Pivot-Vault-2024-Geo-768x593.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Pivot-Vault-2024-Geo-2048x1583.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both reach and stack numbers have increased across the board, and Pivot is also introducing a sixth frame size. All sizes are built with Pivot’s Proprietary Ride Tuning which includes custom-tuned carbon layups for size-specific stiffness and “independent strength to weight analysis for each frame” which is said to provide consistent performance from size to size. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-009-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-009-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Pivot Vault Gravel Bike angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-009-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-009-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-009-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-009-Large-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-009-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-009-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While Pivot doesn’t offer any complete builds with a suspension fork, the frame is suspension-corrected and runs a 415mm axle-to-crown fork with a 52mm offset. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Iso-Flex Slims Down, Drops 30.9 Option</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-022-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-022-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Pivot Vault Gravel Bike iso flex\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-022-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-022-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-022-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-022-Large-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-022-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-022-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just the geometry that increases comfort – Pivot Iso-Flex is back and better than ever. The new version is lighter and less bulky, giving the frame a more streamlined look. It’s still obvious that something is up with the seat tube, but you’d be forgiven to think it was just some sort of aero treatment rather than a ride-smoothing seatpost damper. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those uninitiated, Iso-Flex is essentially a damping sleeve that sits between the seat post and the frame. This sleeve absorbs vibration and impact before it travels up to the seat post to the rider, making for a more comfortable ride. The newest version is comprised of a tuned elastomer with a fiber-reinforced nylon inner sleeve and a custom seatpost clamp. It’s also now compatible with 27.2mm seatposts only (Gen 3 could run 27.2 or 30.9), but it’s still dropper post compatible. It’s also serviceable with only Allen wrenches. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>More Drivetrain and Cable Routing Options</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-004-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-004-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Pivot Vault Gravel Bike two colors\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-004-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-004-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-004-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-004-Large-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-004-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-004-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s no secret now, SRAM RED XPLR 13 is here and it requires UDH. Naturally, most new gravel bikes we’re seeing include the move to a UDH dropout like the Vault. As a reminder, the UDH hanger is compatible with any rear derailleur, not just Transmission. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to argue about fully integrated cable routing through the headset? No need. The Vault can route the cables through the headset if you want the cleanest look, but it can also run them through the downtube using the Pivot Cable Port System. All bikes will ship with the Pivot Gravel Stem which can direct the cables into the included Token C-Box headset. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Better still, Pivot will ship these bikes to dealers without the cables run so the customer can choose how they want it run, swap stems, add/remove spacers, etc. Pivot also imagines this will be useful for fitting – if you’re not sure of your perfect fit, you can initially fit the bike with longer hoses and run then through the Cable Ports, then once you’re dialed, you can route it through the headset if you prefer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tire Clearance</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-019-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-019-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Pivot Vault Gravel Bike rear wheel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-019-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-019-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-019-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-019-Large-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-019-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-019-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even by modern standards, the previous generation Vault already had excellent tire clearance at 700c x 47mm.

Pivot’s take on in-frame storage includes a simple and secure latching door with some trick features including an integrated magnet for storing chain quick links. There’s also an integrated strap loop to attach tools or accessories to the door. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside the frame, you’ll find two Toolshed bags which are designed to store a spare inner tube, tools, etc. The Toolshed door also includes clips to hold internally routed cables out of the way to prevent them from impeding the installation or removal of your tool bags. One of the clips is also designed to be slightly looser to allow you to slide your dropper post cable in or out to adjust the position or remove it from the frame. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other Frame Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-043-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-043-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Pivot Vault Gravel Bike angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-043-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-043-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-043-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-043-Large-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-043-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vault-Patagonia-BITW-PivotCycles-043-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vault continues with a front derailleur option with a removable braze-on plate that can also be used for an upper chain guide if running 1x. Spacing is a standard 142mm rear, and 100mm front, and Pivot continues with their use of the BB386EVO Press Fit bottom bracket.
