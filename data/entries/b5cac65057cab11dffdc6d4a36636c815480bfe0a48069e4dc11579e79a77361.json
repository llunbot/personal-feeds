It is woven from the same aerospace-grade titanium used to make the Apple Watch Ultra's case. Apple says \"a custom process of weaving, flattening, laser-welding, grinding, and finely polishing the titanium wire results in precise, interlinking lozenge shapes that provide a luxurious drape, complete with a dual-button, parachute-style buckle secure enough for all water sports.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ultra-milanese-loop.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Hermès Grand H is the first all-stainless steel Apple Watch band from Hermès, while the Hermès En Mer is exclusive to the Apple Watch Hermès Ultra 2, which also features a matching Hermès Maritime watch face that features graphic Cape Cod numerals, a bezel second display, and a Regatta countdown timer for sailing triggered by the Action Button.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also introduced 33 new color options to 13 of its existing Apple Watch bands, including:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n\t<li><strong>Sport Band</strong> ($49): Plum, Lake Green, Denim, Starlight, Light Blush, Stone Gray, and Black.</li>\r<br />\n\t<li><strong>Solo Loop</strong> ($49): Star Fruit, Ultramarine, Lake Green, Light Blush, and Black.</li>\r<br />\n\t<li><strong>Sport Loop</strong> ($49): Blue Cloud, Lake Green, Plum, Ink, and Ultramarine.</li>\r<br />\n\t<li><strong>Nike Sport Band</strong> ($49): Volt Splash.</li>\r<br />\n\t<li><strong>Nike Sport Loop</strong> ($49): Black/Blue, Starlight/Pink, Grey/Blue, Green/Grey, and Blue/Red.</li>\r<br />\n\t<li><strong>Braided Solo Loop</strong> ($99): Denim, Magenta, Lake Green, and Chartreuse.</li>\r<br />\n\t<li><strong>FineWoven Magnetic Link</strong> ($99): Blackberry, Black, and Dark Taupe.</li>\r<br />\n\t<li><strong>FineWoven Modern Buckle</strong> ($99): Deep Blue, Chartreuse, and Dark Taupe.</li>\r<br />\n\t<li><strong>Milanese Loop</strong> ($99): Natural, Gold, and Slate.</li>\r<br />\n\t<li><strong>Alpine Loop</strong> ($99): Tan, Navy, Dark Green, Green, Blue, and Black.</li>\r<br />\n\t<li><strong>Ocean Band</strong> ($99): Navy, Black, and Ice.</li>\r<br />\n\t<li><strong>Link Bracelet</strong> ($349): Natural, Gold, and Slate.</li>\r<br />\n\t<li><strong>Hermès Kilim Single Tour</strong> ($349): Bleu de France, Vert Moyen, and Béton.</li></ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe FineWoven Modern Buckle, Milanese Loop, Link Bracelet continue to feature stainless steel hardware, but with tweaked finishes that match the new Natural, Gold, and Slate titanium color options of the Apple Watch Series 10.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new color options for the Hermès Kilim Single Tour are now available for 46mm Apple Watches only, unlike earlier color options which continue to be available for both casing sizes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll of the new Apple Watch bands are available to order today, but the Apple Watch Series 10 and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> do not launch until Friday, September 20.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-bands/\">Apple Watch Bands</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE\">Apple Watch SE (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/six-new-apple-watch-bands-and-almost-40-colors/\">Apple Introduced These Six New Apple Watch Bands and Almost 40 New Band Colors Today</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-introduced-these-six-new-apple-watch-bands-and-almost-40-new-band-colors-today.2435535/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b5cac65057cab11dffdc6d4a36636c815480bfe0a48069e4dc11579e79a77361","category":"Apple"}
