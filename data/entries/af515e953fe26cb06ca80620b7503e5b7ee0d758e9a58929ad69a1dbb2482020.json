Because of those rumors,\nthough, I’m now convinced that this is a thing and the Switch 2\nwill include this feature. The video specifically shows the\nJoy-Con mouse position as perpendicular to the surface its on. The\nnew Joy-Con mechanic is further cemented by the part of the video\nthat shows a Joy-Con on its side with a section that really looks\nlike an optical mouse light. [...]</p>\n\n<p>But this is Nintendo, and Nintendo consoles almost always have a\ngimmick. The gimmick isn’t always good. Although there were a\ncouple of games that made excellent use of the Wii’s motion\ncontrols, I can think of plenty more that were deeply un-fun. Then\nagain, the Wii U’s gimmick — its tablet — paced the way to the\nfirst Nintendo Switch, the super-adaptable console we all know and\nlove. So you really never know.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ll just say that Nintendo’s controller gimmicks are usually good, so if the new joy-cons can be used like mice, I’ll bet it’s in an unexpected way.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/17/switch-2-joy-cons\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"af515e953fe26cb06ca80620b7503e5b7ee0d758e9a58929ad69a1dbb2482020","category":"Tech"}
