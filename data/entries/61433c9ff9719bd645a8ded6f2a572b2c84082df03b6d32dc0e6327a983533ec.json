Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco carried out genomic sequencing identifying the omicron variant in the person, and the CDC confirmed that sequencing.</p>\n<p>The CDC reported that the person was fully vaccinated and had only mild symptoms that are improving. In a press briefing Wednesday afternoon, top infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said it appeared the person had not yet received a booster shot. Public health experts suggest that booster shots will significantly improve protection against the new, still poorly understood variant.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817319#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817319&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"61433c9ff9719bd645a8ded6f2a572b2c84082df03b6d32dc0e6327a983533ec","category":"Tech"}
