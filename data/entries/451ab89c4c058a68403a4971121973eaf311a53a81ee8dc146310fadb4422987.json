As part of the electric Porsche's midlife refresh, there's a new Taycan that sits atop the performance tree, appropriately named the Taycan Turbo GT. It's the most powerful Taycan you can buy, with a peak output of 1,092 hp (815 kW), and the boffins in Germany have even cut about 157 lbs (72 kg) from the curb weight.</p>\n<p>The eagle-eyed Porsche observer probably knew a faster Taycan was on the way. In January, wearing manufacturer's camo and described as an \"<a href=\"https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a46265765/porsche-taycan-nurburgring-record/\">unnamed pre-production prototype</a>,\" the Taycan Turbo GT lapped the Nürburgring Nordschleife in 7:05.55, 20 seconds faster than Tesla's best time with its Model S Plaid (and 26 seconds faster than the Taycan Turbo S, previously the fastest variant).</p>\n<p>Now, shorn of its camouflage and proudly bearing the Turbo GT name—as well as sporting the Taycan's new facelifted look—it has set a new record at Laguna Seca in California. With development driver Lars Kern behind the wheel, the Taycan Turbo GT lapped the 2.2-mile (3.6 km) circuit in 1:27.87, which is a track record for a production EV at that track.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009142#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009142&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
