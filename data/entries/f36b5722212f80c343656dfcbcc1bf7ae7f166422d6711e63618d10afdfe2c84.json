A UK collaboration of scientists and artists has combined light painting with low-cost air pollution sensors to visualize concentrations of particulate matter (PM) in select locations in India, Ethiopia, and Wales. The objective is to creatively highlight the health risks posed by air pollution, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01409-4\">new paper</a> published in the journal Nature Communications.</p>\n<p>“Air pollution is the leading global environmental risk factor,\" <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1047036?\">said co-author Francis Pope</a>, an environmental scientist at the University of Birmingham in the UK who spearheaded the <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021EGUGA..23.2255P/abstract\">Air of the Anthropocene</a> project with artist Robin Price. \"[The project] creates spaces and places for discussions about air pollution, using art as a proxy to communicate and create dialogues about the issues associated with air pollution. By painting with light to create impactful images, we provide people with an easy-to-understand way of comparing air pollution in different contexts—making something that was largely invisible visible.\"</p>\n<p>Light painting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_painting\">has been around</a> since 1889, when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne-Jules_Marey\">Étienne-Jules Marey</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Demen%C3%BF\">Georges Demeny</a>, who were investigating the use of photography as a scientific tool to study biological motion, created the first known light painting called <em>Pathological Walk From in Front</em>. In 1914, Frank and Lillian Mollier Gilbreth tracked the motion of manufacturing and clerical workers using light painting techniques, and <a href=\"https://cocktailpartyphysics.com/tripping-the-light-fantastic/\">in 1935,</a> Man Ray \"signed\" his <em>Space Writing</em> series with a penlight—a private joke that wasn't discovered until 74 years later by photographer/historian <a href=\"http://www.ellencareyphotography.com/pictus-writ-man-ray/\">Ellen Carey</a> in 2009.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029387#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029387&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f36b5722212f80c343656dfcbcc1bf7ae7f166422d6711e63618d10afdfe2c84","category":"Tech"}
