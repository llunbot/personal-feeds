Researchers have caught wild chimpanzees on camera engaging in what appears to be similar activity: sharing fermented African breadfruit with measurable alcoholic content. According to a <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(25)00281-7\">new paper</a> published in the journal Current Biology, the observational data is the first evidence of the sharing of alcoholic foods among nonhuman great apes in the wild.</p>\n<p>The fruit in question is seasonal and comes from <em>Treculia africana</em> trees common across the home environment of the wild chimps in Cantanhez National Park in Guinea-Bissau. Once mature, the fruits drop from the tree to the ground and slowly ripen from a hard, deep green exterior to a yellow, spongier texture. Because the chimps are unhabituated, the authors deployed camera traps at three separate locations to record their feeding and sharing behavior.</p>\n<p>They recorded ten instances of selective fruit sharing among 17 chimps, with the animals exhibiting a marked preference for riper fruit. The authors measured the alcohol content of the fruit with a handy portable breathalyzer between April and July, 2022, and found almost all of the fallen fruit (90 percent) contained some ethanol, with the ripest containing the highest levelsâ€”the equivalent of 0.61 percent ABV (alcohol by volume).</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/are-these-chimps-having-a-fruity-booze-up-in-the-wild/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/are-these-chimps-having-a-fruity-booze-up-in-the-wild/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"93546d5bf9b9c5332c6df764e10d56444fdcc1fc633ddb970b13ab71117eb4ad","category":"Tech"}
