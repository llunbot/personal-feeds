It's important to note that suppliers are tight-lipped about specific details about their client's work, especially suppliers working for Apple.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nReliable Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> had previously stated that an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/03/apple-14-1-inch-macbook-pro-mini-led/\">updated iPad mini with a mini-LED display would launch in 2020</a>, but likely due to the global health crisis and delays in production, that failed to materialize. The ‌‌iPad mini‌‌ rumor cycle has been rather cloudy, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/11/ipad-mini-6-thinner-bezels-usb-c-rumor/\">some claims have pointed</a> to a significant redesign featuring no home button, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> sensor embedded into the power button, a USB-C port, and a larger display. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRumors are also conflicting on whether the upcoming ‌iPad mini‌ will feature Apple's current flagship A14 chip, included in the latest <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a>, or whether <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/ipad-mini-6-a15-chip-and-smart-connector/\">the iPad will use the A15 chip</a>, destined for the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>. Rumors have also suggested that a \"Pro\" model of the ‌iPad mini‌ is also in the works; however, that doesn't seem to be likely. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini 5</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/\">Ross Young</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/23/ipad-mini-mini-led-display-analyst/\">Next iPad Mini Won't Feature Mini-LED Display, Claims Display Analyst</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-ipad-mini-wont-feature-mini-led-display-claims-display-analyst.2305224/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=STyvoa2wJa0:rx5iwvJ6eIg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=STyvoa2wJa0:rx5iwvJ6eIg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/STyvoa2wJa0\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ab60526d004520a71fcafb4f694e9c65258802700f28942686cf5c4c21284401","category":"Apple"}
