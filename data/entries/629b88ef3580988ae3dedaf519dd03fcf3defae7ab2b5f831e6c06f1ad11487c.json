Of course while most fans are busy celebrating riders and teams, behind the scenes <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-sponsors\" target=\"_blank\">sponsors</a> will be whooping up their Christmas parties after they backed winners on the biggest stages in cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some sponsors have more skin in the game than others, with their products being used by riders in races the stakes are significantly higher. It’s certainly not great for business when Guillaume Martin says your £10k bike is too heavy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without getting too into the nitty gritty of teams’ tech partners – you can see the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/worldtour-team-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">full list here</a> and figure out which <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bottle-cage\" target=\"_blank\">bottle cage</a> producer was the most successful if that’s your thing – we’ve tallied up the totals and figured out which bikes, groupsets and wheels were ridden to the most stage wins at the men’s and women’s Giro d’Italia, Tour de France and Vuelta a España in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Best bike brands of the 2024 Grand Tours</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Specialized (AG Insurance-Soudal, Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe, SD Worx-Protime, Soudal-QuickStep), 17 stage wins, 2 overall</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/vollering-bike-in-air-sprintcycling-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"vollering with bike in air\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/vollering-bike-in-air-sprintcycling-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/vollering-bike-in-air-sprintcycling-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/vollering-bike-in-air-sprintcycling-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/vollering-bike-in-air-sprintcycling-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/vollering-bike-in-air-sprintcycling-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/vollering-bike-in-air-sprintcycling-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/vollering-bike-in-air-sprintcycling-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/vollering-bike-in-air-sprintcycling-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/vollering-bike-in-air-sprintcycling-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/vollering-bike-in-air-sprintcycling-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O/Sprint Cycling Agency</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bike supplier for four WorldTour teams, Specialized is the most victorious bike brand in Grand Tours for the second year running. Specialized bikes took 17 stages in total as well as overall victories in both Vueltas from Primož Roglič and Demi Vollering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, despite the women’s tours having fewer stages and Specialized’s men’s teams being among the biggest, the brand had more success thanks to its women’s teams, whose exploits comprise nine of those 17 stages. Breakout wins for AG Insurance’s Kim Le Court and Justine Ghekiere and four for Vollering alone meant that Specialized just scraped ahead of the second placed brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Colnago (UAE Team Emirates, UAE Team ADQ), 16 stage wins, 2 overall</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh what could’ve been. Tadej Pogačar almost single handedly took Colnago to the very top – and surely would have if he’d have ridden the Vuelta. However just the one victory from women’s team UAE Team ADQ courtesy of Chiara Consonni wasn’t enough to hold off the charge from the Big S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering the number of teams Specialized sponsors this is to be expected though and it is a huge boost for Colnago to be this high as it didn’t even feature in the top three last year. Could they go even higher in 2025?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3.

They’re also one down overall, as Van Vleuten won the Giro and the Vuelta last year, but considering Kasia Niewiadoma won for Canyon’s name-sponsored team at the biggest race of all, the German brand will be pretty happy with that return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also breakthrough stage wins for Puck Pieterse and Neve Bradbury, so you’d expect a bounce back for 2025 is on the cards. Maybe Enric Mas will finally deliver that Vuelta victory. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Top ten most successful bike brands</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Specialized, 17 stages<br />2. Colnago, 16 stages<br />3.

The American brand has control over the women’s peloton including SD Worx, Lidl-Trek and of course Canyon-SRAM, so took all three overall wins on the women’s side. Primož Roglič was its saving grace at the Vuelta, while sprint wins for Jonathan Milan and Wout van Aert’s Vuelta performance helped keep the numbers respectable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo is yet to make a WorldTour comeback despite finally releasing a wireless electronic groupset.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best wheels of the 2024 Grand Tours</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Roval, Shimano and Enve, 17 wins</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The race for the most successful – or winningest if you’re a terrible person – wheel brand in 2024 was so tight it was split between Roval, Shimano and Enve. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of these have very different ways of getting to that number though. Roval’s entries are just from the Specialized teams, easy. Shimano has a number of teams, but not all the ones that use Shimano groupsets – teams that use Shimano wheels include Ineos, Alpecin(and Fenix)-Deceuninck, FDJ (both) and DSM-Firmenich-PostNL. Enve’s tally is made from all UAE’s wins on the Colnagos, plus a single success by one Anthony Turgis on the Enve-sponsored TotalEnergies team to take the Utah manufacturer to the very top alongside two giants of the sport. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s hope we counted correctly…</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/classified-sponsors-gravel-team-and-launches-three-new-wheelsets\">Classified sponsors gravel team and launches three new wheelsets</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-sponsors\">Who actually are the Tour de France team sponsors 2024?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/worldtour-team-bikes\">All the Tour de France team bikes, tech and kit 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/best-bikes-groupsets-wheels-pro-cycling-2024\">Which bike brands, groupsets and wheels won the most at Grand Tours in 2024?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"629b88ef3580988ae3dedaf519dd03fcf3defae7ab2b5f831e6c06f1ad11487c","category":"Cycling"}
