You can buy the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/cotic-flaremax-gen5-review/\" target=\"_blank\">FlareMAX I reviewed from Cotic</a> if you ride a C5. The price is more than reasonable for a made in the UK chassis with XT. Both Cy and myself feel it’s better that it stays in the States now, as shipping it back to the UK doesn’t make sense and is expensive.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested, contact me at <a href=\"https://radbazaar.theradavist.com/listing/OSpXDMOLFSMBjgUG7VVX\" target=\"_blank\">The Rad Bazaar listing</a> and I’ll connect you to Cotic. I’ll include the Wolf Tooth B-Rad but am keeping the bottle cage! I cleaned it up real nice and it’s boxed and ready to roll.</p>\n<p>I really really love this bike, and if money wasn’t so tight right now, I’d buy it.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/cotic-flaremax-gen5-for-sale/\">The Cotic FlareMAX Gen5 John Reviewed is For Sale</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"eecea770a7bc6b4f6e6ade02c711f6d6de1d629f510eb2ffdb65cbf3c0cea1d5","category":"Cycling"}
