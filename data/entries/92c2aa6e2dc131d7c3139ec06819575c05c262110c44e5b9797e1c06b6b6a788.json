Built around stiff 38mm stanchions, it’s aimed at riders and racers who need maximum stiffness and travel from a single-crown package.</p>\n<p>Sitting at the top of the range is the <strong>ZEB Ultimate</strong>, often found on some of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-enduro-bikes/\">best enduro bikes</a> on the market. Specced with a DebonAir+ <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/coil-vs-air/\">air spring</a> and the new Charger 3 RC2 damper, this fork also benefits from RockShox’s ButterCup technology, and premium SKF wiper seals and Maxima Plush damper fluid.</p>\n<p>The ZEB Ultimate also features Pressure Relief Valves on the fork lowers. Rounding out this flagship package is a machined and anodised crown for durability and weight reduction.</p>\n<p>The <strong>ZEB Select+</strong> shares many features with the flagship ZEB, including the DebonAir+ air spring, Charger 3 RC2 damper and Pressure Relief Valves, but it misses out on the vibration-damping ButterCups and machined crown.</p>\n<p>The <strong>ZEB Select</strong> is specced with a DebonAir+ air spring and the more basic Charger RC damper. The rest of the technology is carried over from the Select+ model, apart from the Pressure Relief Valves, which can be retrofitted if desired.</p>\n<p>The entry-level ZEB shares the same DebonAir+ air spring as its higher-end counterparts. However, it gets RockShox’s new entry-level Rush RC damper for easy low-speed compression and rebound adjustability. The rest of the internals are borrowed from the ZEB Select.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>RockShox Lyrik</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Lyrik is a popular choice on many of the best trail bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / SRAM</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Intended use:</strong> Trail</li>\n<li><strong>Travel:</strong> 140, 150 or 160mm</li>\n<li><strong>Wheel sizes:</strong> 27.5 or 29in</li>\n</ul><p>The Lyrik is RockShox’s most versatile fork. With 35mm stanchions, it is aimed at mountain bikers who want to be equipped to ride a variety of trails.</p>\n<p>The top-of-the-range <strong>Lyrik Ultimate</strong> gets all the bells and whistles. It’s equipped with a DebonAir+ air spring and Charger 3 RC2 damper, making it a popular choice for some of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">best trail bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>Much like the ZEB, it also boasts ButterCup technology, Pressure Relief Valves, premium SKF seals and Maxima Plush damper fluid, as well as a machined and anodised crown.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Lyrik Select+</strong> also gets most of RockShox’s top-of-the-line technology, such as the DebonAir+ air spring and Charger 3 RC2 damper. While it also benefits from Pressure Relief Valves and premium seals and damper fluid, it misses out on the ButterCups and machined crown.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Lyrik Select</strong> has a DebonAir+ air spring, but not the premium Charger 3 RC2 damper, instead getting the more basic Charger RC with low-speed compression and rebound adjustment. It also lacks Pressure Relief Valves, but these can be retrofitted.</p>\n<p>In its most basic guise, the Lyrik relies on a DebonAir+ air spring and entry-level Rush RC damper. The internal seals and damper fluid are shared with the rest of the line-up and you can also upgrade to Pressure Relief Valves.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>RockShox Pike</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Pike comes with 120, 130 or 140mm of travel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Intended use:</strong> Trail and downcountry</li>\n<li><strong>Travel:</strong> 120, 130 or 140mm</li>\n<li><strong>Wheel sizes:</strong> 26 (Pike DJ), 27.5 or 29in</li>\n</ul><p>The RockShox Pike is all about trail and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downcountry-mountain-bikes/\">downcountry</a> riding. While it has the same 35mm stanchion diameter as the Lyrik, the Pike features a slimmed-down chassis to save weight.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Pike Ultimate</strong> is packed full of flagship RockShox technology. Like the ZEB and Lyrik Ultimate, it features a DebonAir+ air spring, Charger 3 RC2 damper, Pressure Relief Valves and ButterCups. Premium SKF seals, Maxima damper fluid and a machined and anodised crown complete the package.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Pike Select+</strong> is treated to almost all the same technology as the Pike Ultimate, but misses out on the ButterCups and the machined crown.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Pike Select</strong> gets a more basic Charger RC damper, with easy-to-adjust low-speed compression and rebound. Apart from the Pressure Relief Valves, which can be retrofitted, the Pike Select shares the same DebonAir+ air spring, seals and damper fluid as the rest of the Pike line-up.</p>\n<p>RockShox’s entry-level trail fork, the Pike, shares the same Rush RC damper as the other base models in the signature trail and enduro range. It also has the same internal seals and damper fluid. Pressure Relief Valves are available as a retrofittable upgrade.</p>\n<p>Designed specifically for use on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/dirt-jump-bikes/\">dirt jump</a> and slopestyle bikes, the <strong>Pike DJ</strong> features a custom-tuned Charger damper and Solo Air air spring designed to offer maximum progression for harsh landings and heavy compressions.</p>\n<p>The Pike DJ is available with 100 or 140mm of travel and is exclusive to 26in wheels.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>RockShox BoXXer</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The BoXXer is designed for downhill racing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Intended use:</strong> Downhill racing</li>\n<li><strong>Travel:</strong> 180, 190 or 200mm</li>\n<li><strong>Wheel sizes:</strong> 27.5 or 29in</li>\n</ul><p>The RockShox BoXXer is a triple-clamp fork designed for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downhill-mountain-bikes/\">downhill</a> racers with 35mm stanchions.</p>\n<p>The <strong>BoXXer Ultimate</strong> is the flagship model. It has a Charger 2.1 damper and a downhill-tuned DebonAir air spring. It uses SKF wiper seals and Maxima Plush damper fluid.</p>\n<p>The <strong>BoXXer Select</strong> uses the same chassis and downhill-tuned DebonAir air spring as its flagship counterpart.

It’s a light but stiff suspension fork for racing or setting hot laps on the local cross-country course. The SID is built with 35mm stanchions and is available for use only with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-29er/\">29in wheels</a>.</p>\n<p>The top-end <strong>SID Ultimate</strong> features RockShox’s Charger Race Day damper, designed to be as light as possible, while offering a lockout platform for the climbs. The DebonAir air spring is tuned to deliver plenty of support and a higher ride height. A machined crown, SKF wiper seals and Maxima Plush damper fluid add the final touches.</p>\n<p>The <strong>SID Select+</strong> shares the same DebonAir air spring as the SID Ultimate, but it gets a Charger 2 RL damper and misses out on the machined crown. Other than that, it shares its seals and damper fluid with the flagship model.</p>\n<p>The <strong>SID Select</strong> has a spec sheet that’s almost identical to the more expensive Select+ model. The only difference is that it comes fitted with the older Charger RL damper.</p>\n<p>The entry-level SID features the same DebonAir air spring, and SKF and Maxima internals paired with the basic Rush RL damper.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>RockShox SID SL</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The SID SL prioritises low weights.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / OurMedia</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Intended use:</strong> Cross-country</li>\n<li><strong>Travel:</strong> 100mm</li>\n<li><strong>Wheel sizes:</strong> 29in</li>\n</ul><p>Designed for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cross-country-racing-guide/\">cross-country racers</a> looking for the lightest fork available, the RockShox SID SL uses 32mm stanchions and specially machined lowers to shave as much weight as possible.</p>\n<p>Four models are available (the <strong>SID SL Ultimate</strong>, <strong>SID SL Select+</strong>, <strong>SID SL</strong> <strong>Select</strong> and <strong>SID SL</strong>), which share the same internals as the RockShox SID forks.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>RockShox Domain</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The RockShox Domain sits just below the ZEB.</span></figcaption><span> <i>RockShox</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Intended use:</strong> Enduro</li>\n<li><strong>Travel:</strong> 150, 160, 170, 180 or 190mm</li>\n<li><strong>Wheel sizes:</strong> 27.5 or 29in</li>\n</ul><p>The RockShox Domain is a more affordable version of the ZEB, aimed at budget-conscious enduro riders.
