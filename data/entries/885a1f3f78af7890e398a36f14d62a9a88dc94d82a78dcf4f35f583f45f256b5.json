Either way, Apple's intention is to keep the price below $500. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast week, <em>The Information</em> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/when-to-expect-the-next-iphone-se/\">reported</a> that Apple plans to release a redesigned iPhone SE in the spring of 2025 that will remain the \"cheaper\" option in Apple's iPhone lineup. The design is said to be similar to the standard iPhone 14, which means Touch ID and the Home button will be replaced by Face ID and a display notch. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlong the same lines, the iPhone SE 4 could have an OLED display rather than LCD, and the display size will increase from 4.7 inches to 6.1 inches. Other rumored features for the next iPhone SE include a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-se-4-details/\">USB-C port and an Action button</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe panel prices for the iPhone SE 4 are said to be a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/iphone-se-4-oled-supplier-likely-boe/\">lot lower</a> than suppliers charge for the OLED displays used in the iPhone 15, since the panels for the SE will use legacy parts identical to those used in the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14, so the suppliers won't need to make new investments in R&amp;D. Display manufacturers are believed to have been bidding to supply the panels since at least last August.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe third-generation iPhone SE was released in March 2022, so there is likely to be pent-up demand for a new model that includes some of the latest features of Apple's flagship iPhone models.
