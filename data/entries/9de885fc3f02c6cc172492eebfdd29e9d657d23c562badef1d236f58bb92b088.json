While the road racing may be calming down, cyclocross continues to heat up. Pim Ronhaar (Baloise Trek Lions) won the latest World Cup race in Dublin for the men.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div><p><em>Results powered by <a href=\"https://firstcycling.com/race.php?r=19104&amp;y=2023\" target=\"_blank\">FirstCycling.com</a></em></p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After a string of podiums this November, Lucinda Brand (Baloise Trek Lions) hit the top step in Dublin for her 50<sup>th</sup> elite victory in cyclocross, beating Alpecin-Deceuninck’s Ceylin del Carmen Alvarado – who had won her previous four races in Niel, Dendermonde, Hoogstraten and Troyes – by 38 seconds. Britain’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/zoe-backstedt-cyclist\" target=\"_blank\">Zoe Bäckstedt</a> (Canyon-SRAM) finished third. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Team news continues to keep us ticking over until the new year. The latest developments include AG2R’s fashion crime, the new name for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jumbo-visma\" target=\"_blank\">Jumbo-Visma</a>, and where Tobias Foss is headed for the 2024 season. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/multi-discipline-cyclocross-riders-2023\">8 multi-discipline cyclocross riders to watch this winter</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mens-pro-cycling-highlights-2023\">My top 10 moments in the 2023 men’s road cycling season</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/the-birth-of-van-rysel-road-bikes-designed-for-performance\">The birth of Van Rysel: road bikes designed for performance</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>AG2R-Citroën become Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale – and ditch brown shorts! </h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>WELCOME ON BOARD !<br />À partir du 1er janvier 2024, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Decathlon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@Decathlon</a> devient co-partenaire de l'équipe cycliste <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AG2RLAMONDIALE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@AG2RLAMONDIALE</a>.<br /><br />Nos coureurs de l’équipe DECATHLON AG2R LA MONDIALE pourront compter sur le savoir-faire de <a href=\"https://twitter.com/van_rysel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@van_rysel</a> pour leur équipement en vélos, casques et lunettes. <a href=\"https://t.co/cJ0PIOdQ5c\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/cJ0PIOdQ5c</a></p>— DECATHLON AG2R LA MONDIALE TEAM (@AG2RCITROENTEAM) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AG2RCITROENTEAM/status/1729084914312544448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">November 27, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, brown bibs. You were bigger than the whole sky. Taylor Swift lyrics aside, the brown bibs worn by iterations of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ag2r-citroen\" target=\"_blank\">AG2R-Citroën</a>, now renamed Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale, became an icon in the cycling world. Like Marmite, people either loved or hated them.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I initially dipped a toe in the dislike side upon their inception. They’re brown, who wants to ride in those? Oh, how wrong I was. I quickly embraced the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-rules-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Rule</a>-breaking colour, forming a parasocial relationship with a cut of fabric as many did over the years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the arrival of new title sponsor Decathlon, however, the bib shorts are now black, with the jersey a combination of white and light blue for the WorldTour, development and U19 teams. Following the end of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/bmc\" target=\"_blank\">BMC’s</a> three-year partnership with the squad, they will now ride with Decathlon’s Van Rysel bikes, helmets and glasses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside the new kit and bike reveal, Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale announced a plethora of signings, including sprinter Sam Bennett from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/bora-hansgrohe\" target=\"_blank\">Bora-Hansgrohe</a>, Victor Lafay from Cofidis and Bruno Armirail from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/groupama-fdj\" target=\"_blank\">Groupama-FDJ.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taylor Swift was not available for comment. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy a pair of AG2R-Citroën brown bib shorts #ForTheLads from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bobshop.com%2Fen%2Frosti%2Fag2r-citroen-team-2023-bib-shorts%2Fbrown-white%2F\" target=\"_blank\">bobshop.com (£96.46)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Jumbo-Visma become Visma-Lease a Bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CAuldPhoto-2023-Vuelta-Stage21-5815-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CAuldPhoto-2023-Vuelta-Stage21-5815-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CAuldPhoto-2023-Vuelta-Stage21-5815-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CAuldPhoto-2023-Vuelta-Stage21-5815-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CAuldPhoto-2023-Vuelta-Stage21-5815-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CAuldPhoto-2023-Vuelta-Stage21-5815-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CAuldPhoto-2023-Vuelta-Stage21-5815-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CAuldPhoto-2023-Vuelta-Stage21-5815-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CAuldPhoto-2023-Vuelta-Stage21-5815-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CAuldPhoto-2023-Vuelta-Stage21-5815-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CAuldPhoto-2023-Vuelta-Stage21-5815-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Chris Auld</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From 2024, Jumbo-Visma will ride under the new name of Visma-Lease a Bike (officially, the new name is Team Visma | Lease a Bike, but there are only so many crimes against punctuation we’re prepared to endure). Lease a Bike – which is owned by the same conglomerate that owns the team’s bike sponsor Cervélo as well as a <a href=\"https://pon.com/en/about-pon/companies/\" target=\"_blank\">long list brands</a> including Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Cannondale, GT Bicycles, Lamborghini, Nimbl, Porsche, Santa Cruz, Schwinn, Seat, Škoda, Urban Arrow and Volkswagen – had sponsored the team under a smaller umbrella but stepped up to cover the loss of Jumbo.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jumbo-Visma have been the biggest topic of off-season conversations so far, including the failed merger with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/soudal-quickstep\" target=\"_blank\">Soudal-QuickStep</a> and the departure of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\">Primož Roglič</a> to Bora-Hansgrohe.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>‘Fanboy’ Tobias Foss to Ineos Grenadiers </h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>About 11 years ago the kid on the picture would always sneak in a garment from his favourite cycling team.

Foss, a former individual time-trial <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uci-world-championships\" target=\"_blank\">World Champion</a>, is eyeing the 2024 Paris Olympics among other goals.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking about his new team, Foss said, ‘When I was 14 years old and started cycling, Edvald Boasson Hagen and Team Sky became my idols and my favourite team. After that, Chris [Froome], Bradley [Wiggins] and Geraint [Thomas] inspired me as I dreamt of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I still can’t believe that this is happening; it’s funny as I was the biggest fanboy ever of this team and now I am actually in the team!’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>See you soon for another edition of Pro Log. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2023-pro-cycling-ag2r-decathlon\">Pro Log: AG2R bin brown bibs, Jumbo-Visma become Visma-Lease a Bike and Tobias Foss signs with Ineos Grenadiers</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"9de885fc3f02c6cc172492eebfdd29e9d657d23c562badef1d236f58bb92b088","category":"Cycling"}
