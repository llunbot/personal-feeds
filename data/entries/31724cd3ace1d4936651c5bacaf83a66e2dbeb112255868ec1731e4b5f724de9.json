No big deal, right? Anyone who pays close attention to the launch industry knows delays are part of the business. A broken component on the rocket, a summertime thunderstorm, or high winds can thwart a launch attempt. Launch companies know this, and the answer is usually to try again the next day.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/theres-a-secret-reason-the-space-force-is-delaying-the-next-atlas-v-launch/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/theres-a-secret-reason-the-space-force-is-delaying-the-next-atlas-v-launch/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"31724cd3ace1d4936651c5bacaf83a66e2dbeb112255868ec1731e4b5f724de9","category":"Tech"}
