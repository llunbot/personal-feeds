If past timelines are any indication, US users should get the update in the next week or so once Samsung huddles up with your cellular carrier.</p>\n<p>Android 14 came out for Pixel phones on October 4, so Samsung is releasing the OS in under a month. That is easily a new record for the company and a huge improvement over the usual multi-month wait. Like previous years, Samsung started <a href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s23-android-14-one-ui-6-0-beta-update-live/\">a beta program</a> for the new Android release about a month before Google's official release. Is this increased speed the result of Google's constant work to make Android easier to upgrade or just a side effect of Android 14 also being <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/android-14-review-theres-always-next-year/\">one of the smaller releases</a> in recent years?</p>\n<p>In Samsung land, Android 14 is called \"One UI 6\" and also comes with a range of <a href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/one-ui-6-0/\">Samsung UI changes</a>. Apparently, the quick settings have been redesigned, and there are a lot of changes to the camera and photo editing experience. For now, the first release is for users of Samsung's latest flagship, but eventually, the update will hit devices from the last three years. For S23 users on Android 13, expect about a 3GB download.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979825\">Read on Ars Technica</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979825&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"57c8f11c8d5af35ef028dd3dea4db7bb0aaa029deecd7c927a668ee07666eebf","category":"Tech"}
