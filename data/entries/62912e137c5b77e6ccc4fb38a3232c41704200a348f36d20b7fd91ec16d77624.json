So if you have an older iPad, you’ll need one of the older Pencils. And today, you can one for cheaper than ever: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MUWA3AM-A-Pencil-USB-C/dp/B07K1WWBJK/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the 2nd-gen Apple Pencil for $79</a>, a savings of $50 and the lowest price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2nd-gen Apple Pencil magnetically attaches to the side of an older iPad Air or Pro to charge and can be used for navigation, writing, and drawing with little-to-no lag, pixel-perfect precision, and tilt and pressure sensitivity. Here are the iPad models the 2nd-gen Apple Pencil is compatible with: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPad Pro 12.9-inch</strong><br />(3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th generation)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPad Pro 11-inch</strong><br />(1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th generation)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPad Air</strong><br />(4th and 5th generation)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPad mini</strong><br />(6th generation)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple says the 2nd-gen Apple Pencil “delivers pixel-perfect precision and industry-leading low latency and is as easy and natural to use as a pencil.” Like the new Apple Pencil Pro, it has tilt and pressure sensitivity so you can write and draw naturally with a full range of strokes, shading, and artistic effects. If you have an M2 iPad Pro, you can use the Apple Pencil hover feature to preview marks before you make them and use a double-tap function to quickly switch between brushes and tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Pencil is an indispensable tool for iPad users. And at this price is a great bargain too.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"62912e137c5b77e6ccc4fb38a3232c41704200a348f36d20b7fd91ec16d77624","category":"Apple"}
