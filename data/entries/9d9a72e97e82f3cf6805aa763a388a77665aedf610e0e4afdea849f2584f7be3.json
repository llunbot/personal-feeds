The frog was popular (even getting <a href=\"https://doodles.google/doodle/new-years-eve-2019/\">his own New Year's doodle</a>), and the basic weather stats were useful. But it couldn't compare to Apple's weather, which <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/03/apple-acquires-dark-sky-weather-app-and-its-bad-news-for-android-users/\">nabbed</a> the minute-by-minute precipitation of Dark Sky and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/android-version-of-popular-dark-sky-weather-app-shuts-down/\">ended its life on Android</a>. There were lots of third-party weather apps—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/ars-staff-mobile-apps/\">Ars staffers</a> like RadarScope and Carrot Weather, for example—but it remained an odd choice for Google to mostly ignore the category.</p>\n<p>Google, and its all-in AI obsession, cedes no longer. As <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/pixel/feature-drop-october-2024/#pixel-phones\">suggested by Google in October</a>, and spotted by blogs like <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2024/10/30/pixel-weather-rolling-out/\">9to5Google</a>, an <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.weather&amp;pli=1\">honest-to-goodness weather app</a>, named \"Weather,\" is rolling out to Pixel phones model 6 and newer running Android 15, having started on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/pixel-9-family-the-just-hardware-review-no-ai/\">the Pixel 9 models</a>. As with most Android things, the rollout is gradual, and you may not have it right away; check that you're updated to the latest Android 15 and Play Services versions to clear the way.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/pixel-phones-are-getting-an-actual-weather-app-in-2024-with-a-bit-of-ai/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/pixel-phones-are-getting-an-actual-weather-app-in-2024-with-a-bit-of-ai/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9d9a72e97e82f3cf6805aa763a388a77665aedf610e0e4afdea849f2584f7be3","category":"Tech"}
