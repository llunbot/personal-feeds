The new\ndetail comes in an <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10071/?time=136\">online WWDC session</a> for developers where\nApple shares how 2D video and stereoscopic 3D video work in the\nheadset. [...]</p>\n\n<p>The Vision Pro screens can also automatically switch to 96Hz,\nwhich is designed for playback of videos that are running at 24\nframes per second, like most movies. There’s also support for both\nstandard and high dynamic range (HDR) content.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From what I experienced, I figured it had to be at <em>least</em> 90 Hz. But I wouldn’t be surprised to find out it goes all the way to 120 Hz when needed, like Apple’s ProMotion displays for iPhone 14 Pro models.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/13/vision-pro-90hz\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2270967d20d093015f76a5d265c5124bd02625a2708568f79dacb3c5c774c532","category":"Tech"}
