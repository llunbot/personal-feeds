In September 2020, it was suggested that Samsung had provided <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/10/apple-orders-samsung-foldable-display-samples/\">foldable display samples</a> to Apple for testing purposes, and there have also been rumors that Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/17/lg-apple-foldable-displays/\">working with LG Display</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBack in May, Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that Apple was working to launch a foldable ‌iPhone‌ with an 8-inch flexible OLED display in 2023, but he has said little else about Apple's work on foldable devices since then. <em>Bloomberg</em> in January said that Apple had started \"early work\" <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/iphone-13-in-display-fingerprint-sensor/\">on a foldable iPhone</a>, but development at the time had not expanded beyond a display.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGoing forward, Kuo believes that foldable smartphones are going to become a \"must-have\" for all major smartphone brands, and Samsung at least has definitely been working on perfecting its foldable smartphone options. Earlier this year, Samsung introduced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/26/galaxy-z-fold-3-hands-on/\">the Galaxy Z Fold3</a>, the third-iteration of its foldable smartphone.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div><div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r\n<br />\r\nEarly Galaxy Fold devices from Samsung <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/17/samsung-broken-galaxy-fold-devices/\">were riddled with issues</a>, but Samsung has now had three years to iron out bugs with little competition in the foldable smartphone field. If Apple does opt to come out with a foldable smartphone in 2023 or 2024, it will need to compete with Samsung, a company that now has several years of expertise with foldable devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nKuo has previously said that Apple will need to solve \"key technology and mass production issues\" to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-foldable-iphone-2023/\">launch a foldable iPhone</a> by 2023, so it would be no surprise at all to have the technology delayed until 2024.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/foldable-iphone-2023-earliest/\">No Foldable iPhone Expected Until 2023 at the Earliest, But 2024 More Likely</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/no-foldable-iphone-expected-until-2023-at-the-earliest-but-2024-more-likely.2327354/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_hQOlbVmTlI:g-fE_AMthHM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_hQOlbVmTlI:g-fE_AMthHM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c99aa5ec948a7e213b51f0366be78aed386956c6c82f958f9b74ee50b73d34f6","category":"Apple"}
