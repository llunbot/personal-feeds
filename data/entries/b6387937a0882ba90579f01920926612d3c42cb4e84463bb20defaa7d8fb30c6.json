Eight months pregnant, she was detained for 11 hours, questioned, and had her iPhone seized for evidence before being released. It's the latest in a string of false arrests due to use of facial-recognition technology, which many critics say is not reliable.</p>\n\n<p>The mistake seems particularly notable because the surveillance footage used to falsely identify Woodruff did not show a pregnant woman, and Woodruff was very visibly pregnant at the time of her arrest.</p>\n<p>The incident began with an automated facial recognition search by the Detroit Police Department. A man who was robbed reported the crime, and police used <a href=\"https://www.dataworksplus.com/bioid.html#face\">DataWorks Plus</a> to run surveillance video footage against a database of criminal mug shots. Woodruff's 2015 mug shot from a previous unrelated arrest was identified as a match. After that, the victim wrongly confirmed her identification from a photo lineup, leading to her arrest.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959225#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959225&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b6387937a0882ba90579f01920926612d3c42cb4e84463bb20defaa7d8fb30c6","category":"Tech"}
