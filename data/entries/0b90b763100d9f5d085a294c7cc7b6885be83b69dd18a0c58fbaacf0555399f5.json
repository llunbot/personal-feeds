OK, not just riding around the world, but racing the 18,125 miles (29,169 km) route with 630,000 feet (192,024 m) of climbing fast enough to claim the record. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, the women’s record was held by Jenny Graham at 124 days, 10 hours, and 50 minutes. Lael is no stranger to setting records, and she smashed this one by roughly <em>half a month</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her route started from Millenium Park in Chicago, riding from there to New York. After a plane ride to Porto, Portugal, Lael crossed through Europe, riding south into Turkey, before finishing in Tbilisi, Georgia. Another plane trip found her in Perth, Australia, and a massive ride later she was in Brisbane. Flying from Brisbane to Invercargill, New Zealand, the route wrapped up in the southern hemisphere in Auckland, New Zealand before flying to Anchorage, AK for the final push back to Chicago. For the official record, there was a required distance, but not a required path (we’ve asked for clarification on this, and will report back when we hear). You can see the exact path taken by Lael on <a href=\"https://content.rapha.cc/us/en/story/laels-ride-around-the-world\" target=\"_blank\">Rapha’s page, here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While riding in the lower 48, Lael followed many of the Adventure Cycling Association’s routes, and she is <a href=\"https://lael.funraise.org\" target=\"_blank\">fundraising for the ACA here.  </a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Congratulations, Lael!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fun facts from Lael</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>How many cups of coffee: 200, but I really drink a lot more Coca Cola than coffee! I bet I’m somewhere between 300-600 cokes. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Favorite day of riding: my first day back in Alaska, where I grew up. It felt incredible to be on my home terrain with daylight until 11pm after a winter crossing of Australia and New Zealand. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Most challenging day of riding: on day 4, I was throwing up all day, it never stopped raining and I was getting multiple punctures. I still rode 139 miles, but it was a tough one.  </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Number of countries: 22.  </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Total miles: on day 105, I’m at 17,284. The total should be 18,140 after 110 days.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Average daily miles: 163 miles per day. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Average speed: 14.5 mph.  </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Average daily calories: I’m probably eating between 6,000 and 8,000. I’ve lost a little weight, but not too much. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>The estimated number of people that joined me on the ride: at least 3,000. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nights in hotels: most – I’ve stayed with a few friends along the way too. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nights camping: 3 weeks. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/lael-wilcox-sets-around-the-world-by-bike-record-by-almost-16-days/\">Lael Wilcox Sets Around the World By Bike Record By Almost 16 Days!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"0b90b763100d9f5d085a294c7cc7b6885be83b69dd18a0c58fbaacf0555399f5","category":"Cycling"}
