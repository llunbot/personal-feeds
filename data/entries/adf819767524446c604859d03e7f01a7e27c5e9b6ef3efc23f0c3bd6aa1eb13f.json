This booster, designated with the serial number B1058, has now flown 18 times. For its maiden launch on May 30, 2020, the rocket <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/05/todays-the-day-weather-permitting-america-is-returning-to-space/\">propelled NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken</a> into the history books on SpaceX's first mission to send people into orbit.</p>\n<p>This ended a nine-year gap in America's capability to launch astronauts into low-Earth orbit and was the first time a commercial spacecraft achieved this feat. At that time, the rocket was fresh from SpaceX's factory in Southern California, glistening white in color, with a bright red NASA \"worm\" logo emblazoned on the side.</p>\n<p>Over the course of its flights to space and back, that white paint has darkened to a charcoal color. Soot from the rocket's exhaust has accumulated, bit by bit, on the 15-story-tall cylinder-shaped booster. The red NASA worm logo is now barely visible.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1981177#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1981177&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"adf819767524446c604859d03e7f01a7e27c5e9b6ef3efc23f0c3bd6aa1eb13f","category":"Tech"}
