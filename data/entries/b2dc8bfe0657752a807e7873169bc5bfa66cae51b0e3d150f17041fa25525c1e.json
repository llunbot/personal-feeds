As a result, Apple says more than one million apps will be available for the headset at launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple last week listed some additional <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-streaming-services-and-sports-apps/\">entertainment apps that will be available</a> on the Vision Pro at launch, including Disney+, ESPN, NBA, MLB, PGA Tour, Max, Discovery+, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+, Peacock, Pluto TV, Tubi, Fubo, IMAX, and TikTok.
