Today, AWS customers make use of twelve different Graviton2-powered instances including the new <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-x2gd-instances-graviton2-power-for-memory-intensive-workloads/\">X2gd instances</a> that are designed for memory-intensive workloads. All Graviton processors include dedicated cores &amp; caches for each vCPU, along with additional security features courtesy of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/\">AWS Nitro System</a>; the Graviton2 processors add support for always-on memory encryption.</p> \n<p><span><strong>C7g in the Works</strong></span><br /> I am thrilled to tell you about our upcoming C7g instances. Powered by new Graviton3 processors, these instances are going to be a great match for your compute-intensive workloads: HPC, batch processing, electronic design automation (EDA), media encoding, scientific modeling, ad serving, distributed analytics, and CPU-based machine learning inferencing.</p> \n<p>While we are still optimizing these instances, it is clear that the Graviton3 is going to deliver amazing performance. In comparison to the Graviton2, the Graviton3 will deliver up to 25% more compute performance and up to twice as much floating point &amp; cryptographic performance. On the machine learning side, Graviton3 includes support for <code>bfloat16</code> data and will be able to deliver up to 3x better performance.</p> \n<p>Graviton3 processors also include a new pointer authentication feature that is designed to improve security. Before return addresses are pushed on to the stack, they are first signed with a secret key and additional context information, including the current value of the stack pointer. When the signed addresses are popped off the stack, they are validated before being used. An exception is raised if the address is not valid, thereby blocking attacks that work by overwriting the stack contents with the address of harmful code. We are working with operating system and compiler developers to add additional support for this feature, so please get in touch if this is of interest to you.</p> \n<p>C7g instances will be available in multiple sizes (including bare metal), and are the first in the cloud industry to be equipped with DDR5 memory. In addition to drawing less power, this memory delivers 50% higher bandwidth than the DDR4 memory used in the current generation of EC2 instances.</p> \n<p>On the network side, C7g instances will offer up to 30 Gbps of network bandwidth and Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) support.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Join the Preview</strong></span><br /> We are now running a preview of the C7g instances so that you can be among the first to experience all of this power. <a href=\"https://pages.awscloud.com/c7gpreview.html\">Sign up now</a>, take an instance for a spin, and let me know what you think!</p> \n<p>— <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffbarr\">Jeff</a>;</p>","author":"Jeff Barr","siteTitle":"AWS News Blog","siteHash":"6093e072e4117ec22616e844cb857d03ca62c57a411a8affc77cb5e8b6b15bf6","entryHash":"f5229baffea8d482c929e7d829ccfa5bfd36bb12c2c3710bd9d472b67e76516a","category":"Tech"}
