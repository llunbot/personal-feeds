An <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17.3 introduces a Stolen Device Protection feature that limits access to your private information in case someone obtains both your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and your passcode. When activated, it requires <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> identity verification to do things like accessing passwords in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> Keychain, turning off Lost Mode, making purchases through Safari with saved payment credentials, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are also features that require verification <em>and</em> have a one-hour delay to access, such as changing an ‌Apple ID‌ passcode, an ‌iPhone‌ passcode, turning off <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a>, and turning off ‌Face ID‌.

Apple recently said that both of these features will be coming in 2024, so we could see them in this beta as iOS 17.3 is expected to launch sometime in January 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is also working on app sideloading in the European Union, a next-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a> feature, and the adoption of<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/\"> rich communication services (RCS)</a>, but these may be features that instead come in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/apple-seeds-ios-17-3-beta-1-to-developers/\">Apple Seeds First Betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 to Developers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-betas-of-ios-17-3-and-ipados-17-3-to-developers.2413527/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6336403ddae1f8415eb4b00767626c6676a570b169689b4969ce1d493d3b8efd","category":"Apple"}
