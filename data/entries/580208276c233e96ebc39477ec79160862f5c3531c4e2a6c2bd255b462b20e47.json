Consumer\nresponse, however, is underwhelming.</li>\n<li>Meta drops the “metaverse” thing and previews Orion,\neffectively declaring that they think VR headsets are the wrong\nthing to build to create the product that defines the next\nbreakthrough step change in personal computing. AR glasses, not\nVR headsets, are the goal.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It’s a lot of back-and-forth volleying, which is what makes the\nearly years of a new device frontier exciting and highly\nuncertain. Big bold ideas get tried out, and most of them wind up\nas dead ends to abandon. Compare and contrast to where we’ve been\nwith laptops for the last 20 years, or the pinnacle we appear to\nhave reached in recent years with phones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/26/a-few-more-thoughts-on-orion-and-the-new-frontier\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"580208276c233e96ebc39477ec79160862f5c3531c4e2a6c2bd255b462b20e47","category":"Tech"}
