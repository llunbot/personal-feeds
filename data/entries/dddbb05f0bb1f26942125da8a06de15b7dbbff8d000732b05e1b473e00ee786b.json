Tetraeder, Global Tetrahedron CEO, in an op-ed for The Onion:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Through it all, InfoWars has shown an unswerving commitment to\nmanufacturing anger and radicalizing the most vulnerable members\nof society — values that resonate deeply with all of us at Global\nTetrahedron.</p>\n\n<p>No price would be too high for such a cornucopia of malleable\nassets and minds. And yet, in a stroke of good fortune, a\nformidable special interest group has outwitted the hapless owner\nof InfoWars (a forgettable man with an already-forgotten name) and\nforced him to sell it at a steep bargain: less than one trillion\ndollars.</p>\n\n<p>Make no mistake: This is a coup for our company and a\nwell-deserved victory for multinational elites the world over.</p>\n\n<p>What’s next for InfoWars remains a live issue. The excess funds\ninitially allocated for the purchase will be reinvested into our\nphilanthropic efforts that include business school scholarships\nfor promising cult leaders, a charity that donates elections to\nat-risk third world dictators, and a new pro bono program pairing\norphans with stable factory jobs at no cost to the factories.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Have I mentioned that under its new ownership, The Onion is once again in good old print, <a href=\"https://membership.theonion.com/\">delivered by mail to annual subscribers</a>? I signed up at the end of September, still looking forward to my first issue.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/15/why-tetraeder-decided-to-by-infowars\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"dddbb05f0bb1f26942125da8a06de15b7dbbff8d000732b05e1b473e00ee786b","category":"Tech"}
