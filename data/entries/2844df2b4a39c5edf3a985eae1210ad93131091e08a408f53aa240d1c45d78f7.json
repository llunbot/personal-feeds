That flight ended after about 90 seconds due to engine problems and other issues with the booster. The FAA has been reviewing data from that accident, including the environmental implications at the launch site and the delayed activation of the rocket's flight termination system.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965711#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965711&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2844df2b4a39c5edf3a985eae1210ad93131091e08a408f53aa240d1c45d78f7","category":"Tech"}
