Not only can you outfit these larger computing rigs with a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/gpus/\">graphics card</a>, but you can readily upgrade to newer, more powerful components down the road as your needs change. Pair a capable desktop with a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/monitors/\">gorgeous display</a> and you've got a more spacious digital canvas for working , gaming, or staying entertained than any laptop can afford.</p>\n<p>More serious gamers will want to check out the <a href=\"https://tidd.ly/3ZCirO1\" target=\"_blank\">OMEN by HP</a> desktop, which is discounted by $670, while casual home users can go for a model without a graphics card for less graphics-intensive productivity tasks. Both the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3T9SOBx\" target=\"_blank\">Acer Aspire</a> and the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/420RchC\" target=\"_blank\">Dell Inspiron</a> desktops are great options and come in at more reasonable prices because they lack the GPU. Enthusiast gamers and workstation users who demand the performance of the latest silicon will want to check out the <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8984087-15378158?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fgaming-and-games%2Falienware-aurora-r15-gaming-desktop%2Fspd%2Falienware-aurora-r15-desktop\" target=\"_blank\">Alienware Aurora R15 Gaming Desktop</a>, which is discounted by $630. Now on sale for $3,600, this desktop packs in a 13th Gen Intel Core i9 processor alongside Nvidia's RTX 3090 graphics.</p>\n<h2>Best desktop deals</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Acer Aspire TC-1760 for $550 (was $620) at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3T9SOBx\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>:</strong> Not the most powerful desktop on our list, Acer's Aspire desktop still comes with Intel's 12th Gen Core i5 processor and is a great option for college students and general PC use around the home. Discrete graphics is notably missing, as this model relies on Intel's UHD Graphics 730. The desktop also packs in 12GB DDR4 memory and a 512GB solid-state drive. Surprisingly, a DVD writer is still included in this model.</li>\n<li><strong>HP Pavilion Gaming Desktop for $1,000 (was $1,315) at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3mCyNaF\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>: </strong>Designed for work and play, this affordable gaming desktop is configured with AMD's Ryzen 7 5700G processor and Nvidia's GeForce RTX 2060 Super graphics. Serious gamers will likely dismiss the older GPU, but at close to 25 percent off, this is a terrific desktop for casual gamers and content creators. It comes with 16GB of RAM, 1TB of solid-state storage, and plenty of ports to connect your gear on the front.</li>\n<li><strong>HP Envy Desktop for $1,230 (was $1,700) on <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3JrpZNL\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>: </strong>If you have a little bit of extra cash, we'd recommend HP's Envy Desktop over the Pavilion model on our list. At $230 more than the Pavilion, you're getting a much sleeker case design, more powerful silicon with Intel's 12th Gen Core i9 processor and Nvidia's RTX 3070 graphics, and similar memory and storage configurations. There's room for expansion and upgrades on the inside, and the tool-less, one-touch latch to open the side panel will give you access to this desktop's internals.</li>\n<li><strong>Dell Inspiron 3910 Desktop for $723 (was $750) at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/420RchC\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>:</strong> At a 10 percent discount, you're getting Intel's 12th Gen Core i5 processor on this Inspiron Desktop configuration, alongside integrated Intel UHD Graphics 730, 256GB of storage, and 16GB of DDR4 memory. Discrete graphics is notably absent, similar to the Acer model on our list, making this compact tower more suited for productivity than creative workflows.</li>\n<li><strong>Dell XPS 8950 Desktop for $1,682 (was $2,349) at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ZChLbr\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>: </strong>This isn't the cheapest price for the XPS 8950 in recent days, but it's still 28 percent off of its retail price. With a 12th Gen Intel Core i7 processor and Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti graphics, you'll still get plenty of performance for creative work and gaming, provided you don't need a more powerful GPU for AAA titles. With accessible ports in the front and an accommodating tower, you'll be able to upgrade to a more capable GPU down the road if your needs change.</li>\n<li><strong>OMEN by HP 45L Gaming Desktop for $1,630 (was $2,300) at <a href=\"https://tidd.ly/3ZCirO1\" target=\"_blank\">HP</a>:</strong> HP's OMEN gaming desktop is now discounted by $670 on the manufacturer's website. This desktop packs in an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X processor, discrete Nvidia RTX 3070 graphics, 16GB of HyperX DDR4 memory, and a 512GB WD Black PCIe NVMe M.2 solid-state drive alongside a 1TB 7200rpm HDD.</li>\n<li><strong>Alienware Aurora R15 Gaming Desktop for $3,600 (was $4,230) at <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8984087-15378158?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fgaming-and-games%2Falienware-aurora-r15-gaming-desktop%2Fspd%2Falienware-aurora-r15-desktop\" target=\"_blank\">Dell</a>:</strong> Dell's latest gaming desktop may be the priciest option on our list, but it's also the most powerful. This gaming powerhouse packs in Intel's 13th Gen Core i9-13900F processor with 24 cores and Nvidia's powerful <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/rtx-4090-review-nvidias-biggest-gpu-is-easily-its-best/\">GeForce RTX 4090 GPU.</a> Other features include 32GB of DDR5 4800 MHz memory along with a 1TB NVM.e M.2 solid-state drive. Less expensive configurations are available as well, with prices starting at $1,400.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/affiliate-link-policy/\" target=\"_blank\">affiliate programs</a>.</em></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923176\">Read on Ars Technica</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923176&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Chuong Nguyen","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"440c60abfac2dd1679607d9eaf05736b3b0edb233dcbc0dec1c6e53351745339","category":"Tech"}
