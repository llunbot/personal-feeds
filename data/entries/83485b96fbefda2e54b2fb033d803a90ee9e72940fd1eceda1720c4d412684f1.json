No. 821.)</p>\n\n<p>Having considered all the filings, and oral argument, the Court\nfinds Apple has failed to satisfy its burden, and the request as\nframed is DENIED. In short, Apple’s motion is based on a selective\nreading of this Court’s findings and ignores all of the findings\nwhich supported the injunction, namely incipient antitrust conduct\nincluding supercompetitive commission rates resulting in\nextraordinarily high operating margins and which have not been\ncorrelated to the value of its intellectual property. This\nincipient antitrust conduct is the result, in part, of the\nantisteering policies which Apple has enforced to harm\ncompetition. As a consequence, the motion is fundamentally flawed.\nFurther, even if additional time was warranted to comply with the\nlimited injunction, Apple did not request additional time other\nthan ten days to appeal this ruling. Thus, the Court does not\nconsider the option of additional time, other than the requested\nten days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>“Metabuttons” is a typo — <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/10/judgment-in-epic-v-apple\">the original ruling</a> used the (already technically ambiguous) term “metadata buttons” there.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a near-certainty that Apple is going to appeal this. But if the appeal doesn’t work, December 9 is just four weeks away.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/12/ygr-motion-to-stay\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"83485b96fbefda2e54b2fb033d803a90ee9e72940fd1eceda1720c4d412684f1","category":"Tech"}
