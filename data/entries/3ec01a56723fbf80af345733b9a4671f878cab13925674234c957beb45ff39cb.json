{"title":"Opinion: Why your next bike should be aluminium","link":"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/are-aluminium-bikes-any-good","date":1698684712000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/are-aluminium-bikes-any-good\">Opinion: Why your next bike should be aluminium</a></p>\n\n<p>There’s a myth in cycling that the bike you should be buying is the bike your local bike shop mechanic rides. The rationale is that mechanics get to see, pull apart and fix everything, so they know what works, what breaks and hence what’s best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a caveat here – the mechanic needs to love bikes and work in a ‘proper’ bike shop. So the dusty second-hand shop you frequented as a kid, where lead mechanic Derek clearly despised bikes and anyone trying to talk to him about bikes, is not much use here. Derek spent his wages on a Mk2 Fiesta (OK, maybe that was just my experience). But find a bike-loving mechanic in a half-decent LBS and you’ll find the ‘thinking rider’s’ bike, the most sensible balance of performance and pennies. There, I wager, you’ll find aluminium.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-aluminium-road-bikes\">Best aluminium road bikes 2023</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/specialized-allez-sprint-vs-cannondale-caad13\">Specialized Allez Sprint vs. Cannondale CAAD13 Disc: Which is the best aluminium race bike?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/eddy-merckx-alu-sprint-custom-build\">What We Ride: James’s ever-loyal Eddy Merckx Alu Sprint road bike</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Let’s get one thing straight: not all aluminium is born equal, but as a general rule aluminium is cheaper than carbon fibre (and also cheaper than performance steel, titanium and magnesium). And yet is it so different?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take an aluminium <a href=\"https://auth.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/10661/specialized-allez-sprint-comp-review\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized Allez Sprint</a> frame and compare it to its sister flagship, the new <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-tarmac-sl8-review\">Tarmac SL8</a>. An Allez frameset costs £1,800, the Tarmac £3,700. Admittedly the Tarmac frame weighs a claimed 780g while the Allez is 1,395g, but gram for buck, the Tarmac is £4.74/g, the Allez a mere £1.29/g. Or put it another way, build the bikes up identically and you’ll be £1,900 better off, and only 615g worse off. The bike mechanic racer knows 615g is nothing. Just chop down your seatpost and leave your phone at home.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03005852/specialized-allez-sprint-5-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Two aluminium road framesets\" /><figcaption>The Specialized Allez Sprint is one of the new breed of high-tech aluminium bikes. </figcaption><figcaption>Matthew Loveridge / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Of course, there are other factors. Sticking with Specialized the Tarmac will be more aero, but by how much? I have no data, but the frames are very similar shapes and, no matter how you skin that cat to make it more slippery, the bike aspect of the rider-bike puzzle only contributes around 20% of the drag. <em>You</em> are the drag, your position affects the drag, and as it turns out, the Allez’s geometry is almost bob-on the same as the Tarmac’s.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>And there’s more…</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/05141549/cannondale-caad13-disc-review-07_0-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"cannondale-caad13-disc-review-07_0\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/05141549/cannondale-caad13-disc-review-07_0-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/05141549/cannondale-caad13-disc-review-07_0-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/05141549/cannondale-caad13-disc-review-07_0-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/05141549/cannondale-caad13-disc-review-07_0-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/05141549/cannondale-caad13-disc-review-07_0-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/05141549/cannondale-caad13-disc-review-07_0-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/05141549/cannondale-caad13-disc-review-07_0-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/05141549/cannondale-caad13-disc-review-07_0-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/05141549/cannondale-caad13-disc-review-07_0.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t a puff piece for Specialized. Cannondale has long made the brilliant <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-caad13-105-disc-review\" target=\"_blank\">CAAD bikes</a> (now that <em>is</em> the thinking mechanic’s favourite) and an aluminium Synapse. BMC does a decent turn with an aluminium Teammachine, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/new-trek-emonda-alr-2023\" target=\"_blank\">Trek has an aluminium Émonda</a>, and then there’s Europe’s most popular bike (so Decathlon says), the B’Twin Triban – I defy anyone to find a better road bike for £349.99 than the Triban RC 120 (see it at <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=26895&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;campaign=aluminium+opinion&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decathlon.co.uk%2Fp%2Froad-bike-triban-rc-120-grey%2F_%2FR-p-308062\" target=\"_blank\">Decathlon</a> – it’s not bad looking is it?).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The list goes on, and they’re all similar to their carbon siblings in terms of geometry and tube shapes, but they’re a fraction of the price. And in performance terms, they’re all stiff. But hang on, that’s the problem, isn’t it? Aluminium is just plain horrible to ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Oh hello, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/are-wider-tyres-faster\" target=\"_blank\">wider tyres</a>, how long have you been watching me?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stiffness is why aluminium replaced steel in the pro peloton in the 1990s. But with modern frames having room for at least 28mm tyres, and those now being low-pressure tubeless, there is no such worry about an aluminium bike feeling like a pub bench. Just tune in the comfort with your tyres. The Allez will fit 32mm!</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Oh, and lastly, the environment. Aluminium is easy to recycle – in fact they say a third of the world’s aluminium is being recycled at any given time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only drawback I can think of is that the lack of demand for high-end aluminium bikes means manufacturers spec low-rent parts – you won’t find many bikes going beyond a Shimano 105 groupset and aluminium wheels. It’s these parts that contribute most to weight, far more than the frame. Yet we can change all this. We can start DM’ing bike brands and writing to our local MPs, demanding aluminium is once again taken seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, aluminium won’t be raced by pros, but most of us aren’t pros. We’re just enthusiastic amateurs who want fast, fun bikes that don’t cost the earth. We are the people who want aluminium. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 145 of <em>Cyclist </em>magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/are-aluminium-bikes-any-good\">Opinion: Why your next bike should be aluminium</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"3ec01a56723fbf80af345733b9a4671f878cab13925674234c957beb45ff39cb","category":"Cycling"}
