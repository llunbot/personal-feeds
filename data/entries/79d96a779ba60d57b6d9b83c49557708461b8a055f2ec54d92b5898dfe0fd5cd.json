Itâ€™s the result of a use-after-free error, a class of vulnerability that occurs in software written in the C and C++ languages when a process continues to access a memory location after it has been freed or deallocated. Use-after-free vulnerabilities can result in remote code or privilege escalation.</p>\n<p>The vulnerability, which affects Linux kernel versions 5.14 through 6.6, resides in the NF_tables, a kernel component enabling the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netfilter\">Netfilter</a>, which in turn facilitates a variety of network operations, including packet filtering, network address [and port] translation (NA[P]T), packet logging, userspace packet queueing, and other packet mangling. It was patched in January, but as the CISA advisory indicates, some production systems have yet to install it. At the time this Ars post went live, there were no known details about the active exploitation.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028017#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028017&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"79d96a779ba60d57b6d9b83c49557708461b8a055f2ec54d92b5898dfe0fd5cd","category":"Tech"}
