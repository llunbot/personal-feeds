If you needed proof of sportscar racing being too complicated for the casual fan, consider the fact that the white #79 Porsche 911 RSR is actually radically different from the blue #16 Porsche 911 GT3 R right next to it. From next year, that confusion will be lessened.

This year's Petit Le Mans is also the last race for a fan-favorite class of cars known as GTLM. The category covered Le Mans-legal versions of two-door production cars, which over the years represented a playground for manufacturer-supported programs and some of the world's best racing drivers.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, cutting GTLM is a massive step for the US side of endurance racing, as it ends a direct link between the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship and the annual 24 Hours of Le Mans. But it also makes the sport a bit less complicated.</p>\n<p>\"Even for some of the most avid car people, they have a hard time understanding why the red BMW is so much faster than the yellow and blue one or [why] the red, white, and blue Porsche is so much faster than the #9 car or the #16 or the #88,\" said John Doonan, president of the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA), the sport's organizer.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1812676#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1812676&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
