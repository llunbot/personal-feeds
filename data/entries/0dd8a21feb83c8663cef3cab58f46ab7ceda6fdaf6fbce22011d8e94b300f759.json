Trees at two of the three sites we studied matched the <a href=\"https://arboretum.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk1546/files/inline-files/redwood_exhibits_0.pdf\">average growth rates</a> of their counterparts in the US, where they come from. These remarkable trees are being planted in an effort to help absorb carbon, but perhaps more importantly they are becoming a striking and much-admired part of the UK landscape.</p>\n<p>To live so long, giant sequoias have evolved to be extraordinarily resilient. In their <a href=\"https://www.visitsequoia.com/explore/spring-summer-fall-activities/redwoods-and-sequoias\">native northern California</a>, they occupy an ecological niche in mountainous terrain 1,400–2,100 meters above sea level.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010722#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010722&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"The Conversation","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0dd8a21feb83c8663cef3cab58f46ab7ceda6fdaf6fbce22011d8e94b300f759","category":"Tech"}
