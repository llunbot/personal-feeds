When it comes to mountain bikes, however, brands usually mix and match parts from various groups – and in some cases different brands – to suit the bike’s intended use and meet a specific price point.</p>\n<h2>Components of a mountain bike groupset</h2>\n<h3>Mountain bike crankset</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Shimano offers its XT group in versions with one, two and three chainrings.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy</i></span></div>\n<p>Mountain bike cranksets can be divided into three categories by their number of chainrings.</p>\n<h4>Triple</h4>\n<p>The first is the triple – the old classic. As the name implies, it consists of three chainrings, the largest often being a 42- or 44-tooth outer ring.</p>\n<p>The middle ring is usually a 32 or 34 and the smallest, inside ring, is often a 22- or 24-tooth.</p>\n<p>This setup can offer the largest range of gears, but there is significant redundancy in terms of gear ratios. Cross-chaining is also a concern with a triple if the lowest or highest chainring is selected with the opposite lowest or highest sprocket on the cassette.</p>\n<p>Cranksets with three chainrings aren’t found on modern high-end mountain bikes. They are disappearing from the entry-level market and double- and single-ring drivetrains are quickly becoming the most desired setup and the new normal.</p>\n<h4>Double</h4>\n<p>Cranksets with two chainrings overtook the triple as the most popular mountain bike crankset when SRAM and Shimano introduced 10-speed drivetrains. Double cranksets offer a narrower gear range with less overlap than a triple.</p>\n<p>They use a smaller inner ring (22- to 28-tooth), while the larger outside cog offers a gear that’s generally well-suited to faster riding (34- to 36-tooth).</p>\n<p>Double cranksets are found from entry-level bikes through to high-end models but their popularity is on the wane too.</p>\n<h4>Single</h4>\n<p>The most significant trend in mountain bike drivetrains over the past five years has been the movement toward wide-range <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/1x-drivetrains/\">1x drivetrains</a> with a single chainring.</p>\n<p>Commonly referred to as a ‘1x’ (one-by), this arrangement has been popular on downhill mountain bikes for years, where large gear ranges aren’t needed and chain security (that is, no dropped chains) is very important.</p>\n<p>Following <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-xx1-mountain-bike-transmission-review/\">SRAM’s launch of XX1</a> and the introduction of subsequent wide-range 1×11 and 1×12 groups, the single-ring drivetrain has now become the new norm on high- to mid-level mountain bikes, and is increasingly found on entry-level bikes too, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-sx-eagle-groupset/\">the introduction of SX Eagle</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-nx-eagle-first-ride-review/\">NX Eagle 12-speed</a> drivetrains.</p>\n<p>Chainring size ranges vary widely, depending on the intended use, from 38-tooth chainrings for strong cross-country racers down to 28- and even 26-tooth chainrings on some fat bikes. Most bikes with 1x drivetrains come with 32- or 30-tooth chainrings.</p>\n<p>One key attribute of 1x drivetrains is the use of a chainring with tall, unramped teeth (since there’s no need to shift between chainrings) and alternating tooth widths that match up with the inner and outer links of the chain.</p>\n<p>Both of these features are designed to keep the chain in place without the aid of a front derailleur or chain guide.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The ramped teeth help to keep the chain on the single ring without the need for a chain device or chain guide.</span></figcaption><span> <i>SRAM</i></span></div>\n<p>By removing the front derailleur and corresponding shifter, a single-ring drivetrain is less complex as well as lighter. Many novice riders find 1x drivetrains easier to operate as well.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/gear/article/how-to-convert-to-a-1x-drivetrain-37451/\">How to convert your bike to a 1x drivetrain</a></li>\n</ul><h3>Mountain bike bottom bracket</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Different frames use different bottom bracket systems, including threaded (left) and press-fit (right).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy</i></span></div>\n<p>A crankset won’t get you very far without bearings to spin on. These bearings are pressed or threaded into the mountain bike’s bottom bracket shell.</p>\n<p>Bottom brackets are available in a staggering array of configurations — you might find our <a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/au/gear/article/complete-guide-to-bottom-brackets-36660/\">complete guide to bottom brackets</a> useful.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/road/news/article/how-to-replace-an-external-bottom-bracket-42057/\">How to replace an external bottom bracket</a></li>\n</ul><h3>Mountain bike cassettes</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Shimano’s widest range 12-speed cassette offers a 10-51t spread, while SRAM offers a 12-speed group with a 10-50t range.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy</i></span></div>\n<p>Cassettes come in a wide range of sizes and speeds. Like the crankset, cassette choice is often determined by the bike’s intended riding style and price.</p>\n<p>Mountain bike cassettes can be found in 7- through 12-speed versions. They are usually referred to by the smallest and largest cogs to provide an indication of the total range, e.g. 11-32t or 10-50t.</p>\n<p>Aside from downhill bikes, which often use very narrow-range cassettes, most mountain bikes favour a cassette with a wide spread of gears to make climbing easier. The most commonly found ranges on bikes with double or triple cranksets are 11- to 34- or 36-tooth.</p>\n<p>Single-ring drivetrains go much wider, with SRAM’s 12-speed Eagle-branded drivetrains <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-52-tooth-eagle-cassette/\">providing up to a 10-52t spread</a> (11-50t on SX and NX Eagle), while Shimano offers an 11-46t range on its 11-speed SLX and XT groups and a 10-51t option on its latest 12-speed XTR, XT and SLX groups.</p>\n<h3>Mountain bike chains</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Higher-end chains often feature hollow links or pins to save weight over more affordable versions.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy</i></span></div>\n<p>The groupset brand and the number of gears dictate the type of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bicycle-chains/\">chain</a> you need. In general, as the number of gears increases, the spacing between the cogs shrinks and so the chain becomes narrower as well.</p>\n<p>Because of this, you should only run a chain designed specifically for the number of cogs on your cassette – don’t use a 9-speed chain on a 10-speed drivetrain, or an 11-speed chain on a 12-speed drivetrain. Some chains are even directional and need mounting in a specific orientation, so check upon install.</p>\n<p>More expensive chains often have smoother, more durable and corrosion-resistant coatings, and save weight with hollow links and pins. With that in mind, chains are the first part of a drivetrain to wear out, so it’s often best to invest in a mid-level chain.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-chain-tool/\">Best workshop chain tools | Chain breakers rated by our experts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/gear/article/how-to-replace-a-chain-18117/\">How to replace your worn out bicycle chain</a></li>\n</ul><h3>Mountain bike derailleurs</h3>\n<p>Derailleurs are the components that move the chain between cogs on the cassette and chainrings on the crankset. Each brand offers its own design, but the principle is generally the same.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Front derailleurs move the chain between the chainrings.</span></figcaption><span> <i>BikeRadar</i></span></div>\n<p>When pressed, the shifter pulls or releases a cable, which moves the derailleur, derailing the chain and repositioning it in a different gear.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Rear derailleurs move the chain between cogs on the cassette.</span></figcaption><span> <i>BikeRadar</i></span></div>\n<p>Cables are no longer the only way to control derailleurs. Shimano offers <a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/news/article/shimano-xtr-di2-electronic-shifting-comes-to-mountain-bikes-41184/\">electronically actuated derailleurs on XTR Di2</a> as well as <a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/gear/category/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/product/shimano-xt-di2-m8050-review-50868/\">XT Di2</a>, which use electrical wires connected to the shifter(s). <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/gear/category/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/product/sram-x01-eagle-axs-drivetrain-review-52443/\">SRAM’s AXS groupsets</a> are completely wireless.</p>\n<h3>Mountain bike shifters</h3>\n<p>As previously mentioned, shift levers are used to operate a bicycle’s derailleurs. Shimano and SRAM use different designs, and while they all shift gears, they each have a particular way of doing it.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Current shifter types: left is Shimano’s RapidFire trigger system, in the middle is SRAM’s Grip Shift, and on the right is SRAM’s trigger shifter.</span></figcaption><span> <i>BikeRadar</i></span></div>\n<p>While mechanically different, both SRAM and Shimano offer ‘trigger shifters’. This name is a bit misleading because both companies have refined the lever ergonomics to shift both levers with the thumb, rather than also relying on the rider’s index or ‘trigger’ finger.</p>\n<p>The benefit of this approach is that it allows a rider to shift while also keeping their index finger on the brake lever.</p>\n<p>SRAM offers two systems for its mechanical shifters, Trigger and Grip Shift. The trigger system is more common. Grip Shift functions like a throttle, twisting back and forth to shift. This system has lost popularity in recent years but still holds a loyal following in cross-country racing, since the system is very light and allows riders to shift across the cassette quickly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-x01-eagle-axs-wireless-drivetrain-review/\">SRAM AXS</a> introduced a new design with three buttons, two of which are operated by a paddle that rocks up or down, with the third being a button on the back – the buttons’ operation is customisable in SRAM’s dedicated app.</p>\n<p>Shimano’s Di2 uses electronic switches too and can also be customised via its app.</p>\n<p>Di2 can, for example, make use of Shimano’s Synchro Shift technology, which allows the rider to use a single shift lever to control the front and rear derailleurs. The system’s computer shifts into the optimal chainring and cassette sprocket to keep the rider’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/what-is-cycling-cadence/\">cadence</a> relatively constant.</p>\n<h2>Choosing a mountain bike groupset: price versus performance</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The SRAM derailleur, despite being wireless, carries a 144g weight penalty because of the battery.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Like most components, groupsets vary in price a great deal. So what benefits do more expensive groupsets bring?</p>\n<h3>Groupset weight</h3>\n<p>Keith Bontrager famously said of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-components/\">bicycle parts</a>: “Strong. Light. Cheap. Pick two.”</p>\n<p>A lighter bike will always accelerate, climb and brake better than a heavier one, but without sacrificing strength, something has to give. Whether you’re looking at mountain bike drivetrains, wheels or even complete bikes, reduced weight is often the major factor in increased cost.</p>\n<p>Generally, with mountain bike groups, the more you spend, the lighter they get. Often the performance of the groupset plateaus at the second tier from the top, with reduced weight being the reason for the extra expense.</p>\n<p>For example, the difference between Shimano’s top two tiers, XT and XTR, is around 300g (excluding brakes), while the difference between SRAM’s flagship XX1 Eagle and second-tier X01 Eagle drivetrains is closer to 46g (excluding brakes and bottom bracket).</p>\n<p>These weight differences are the result of more expensive materials and refined, or more time-consuming, manufacturing processes.</p>\n<p>In addition to further machining, hole-drilling and high precision, more expensive components often use materials such as carbon fibre, titanium, lightweight aluminium and ceramic bearings to achieve class-leading low weights.</p>\n<h3>Groupset durability</h3>\n<p>If you’re spending more money on a mountain bike group, you’d expect it to outlast a cheaper option.</p>\n<p>Durability does improve with price, but our experience is that durability also plateaus at the second-tier options. XT in the case of Shimano and X01 in the case of SRAM.</p>\n<p>In some instances, component durability can actually <em>decline</em> at the most expensive option, where absolute weight savings sometimes trump product longevity.</p>\n<p>The more expensive technical components are built with greater precision, refinement and materials that lend themselves to greater longevity. This is apparent in derailleurs and shifters, where the cheaper options will develop play and slop overtime, whereas better parts often remain like new for many years of use.</p>\n<p>Wear items, such as cassettes and chainrings, however, are often the reverse of this. Cheaper options are made of heavier, but more durable steels, while the more expensive versions are made with lighter, but softer, aluminium and titanium metals.</p>\n<h3>Groupset performance</h3>\n<p>In addition to the benefits of reduced weight, more expensive mountain bike groupsets find other ways of increasing performance.</p>\n<p>Most noticeably, higher-priced options provide a smoother, more precise and quicker shift between gears.</p>\n<p>This includes reduced effort at the lever, something that becomes apparent once you’ve been on the bike for a few hours. It’s an area where electronic gears are going to set a new benchmark – ultimate precision and speed at the simple push of a button.</p>\n<p>Another performance example is increased crankset stiffness to provide crisper shifting and more efficient power transfer from the pedals to the rear wheel. This is achieved with more complex designs and materials that increase strength and stiffness without adding weight.</p>\n<h3>Additional groupset features</h3>\n<p>Besides offering extra gears, it’s common for the more expensive groups to offer additional features.</p>\n<p>Clutch-equipped rear derailleurs, such as Shadow RD Plus from Shimano or Type-3 Roller Bearing Clutch from SRAM are an example of a technology that is offered on these brands’ groupsets, from Deore and NX Eagle upwards.</p>\n<p>The clutch keeps the chain taut, which improves shifting over rough terrain, keeping the drivetrain quieter, and reduces the likelihood of dropping a chain.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Both SRAM and Shimano mechs now come with a clutch mechanism to help reduce chain slap.</span></figcaption><span> <i>BikeRadar</i></span></div>\n<p>In reverse of this, gear indicators are a feature often lost as the groupset price increases. The theory being that more experienced riders use gears based on ‘feel’ and don’t need numbers or indicators to help them.</p>\n<h3>Discipline-focused options</h3>\n<p>With mountain biking spanning so many individual disciplines, it shouldn’t be too surprising to find that what works perfectly for climbing steep hills in cross-country may not be ideal for descending cliff faces in downhill.</p>\n<p>This is why discipline-specific groupsets now exist for the more extreme riding styles. We’ll cover these below in the individual brand hierarchies.</p>\n<h2>Shimano’s mountain bike groupsets</h2>\n<p>Japanese manufacturer Shimano offers the widest range of groupsets for mountain biking.</p>\n<p>Shimano’s mountain bike groupset hierarchy, from least expensive and technologically advanced to most, is as follows:</p>\n<ul><li>Shimano Tourney</li>\n<li>Shimano Altus M2000</li>\n<li>Shimano Acera M3000</li>\n<li>Shimano Alivio M3100</li>\n<li>Shimano Cues U6000</li>\n<li>Shimano Deore M6100, M5100, M4100</li>\n<li>Shimano SLX M7100</li>\n<li>Shimano Deore XT M8050</li>\n<li>Shimano Deore XT M8100</li>\n<li>Shimano XTR M9050</li>\n<li>Shimano XTR M9100</li>\n</ul><p>Shimano also offers two downhill-specific groupsets:</p>\n<ul><li>Shimano Zee M640</li>\n<li>Shimano Saint M820</li>\n</ul><h3>Shimano Tourney</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Tourney groupset is Shimano’s budget 6- and 7-speed offering.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Shimano</i></span></div>\n<p>The range starts with Tourney, which is usually found on department-store or children’s bikes and comes in a few different configurations depending on its intended application, whether that’s touring, road or very light mountain biking.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-alivio-m3100-groupset-2020/\">Tourney received its latest update in 2020</a> getting two new 6- and 7-speed mechs and further updates to the shifters, front mechs, cranks and cassettes.</p>\n<p>The groupset is available in 6-, 7- and 8-speed systems combined with triple or double cranksets.</p>\n<h3>Shimano Altus M2000</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Altus is the group you’re likely to find on entry-level mountain bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy</i></span></div>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<p>Next is <a href=\"http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?id=489797&amp;clickref=bikeradar-0&amp;awinmid=2698&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chainreactioncycles.com%2Fs%3Fq%3Dshimano%2Baltus%26cat%3Ddirect\" target=\"_blank\">Altus</a>, this is the group you’re likely to find on entry-level mountain bikes.</p>\n<p>The latest version of Altus offers a 9-speed cassette with a triple crankset with 40/30/22t chainrings.</p>\n<p>The Altus rear derailleur doesn’t use Shimano’s Shadow Plus clutch technology for chain stability, but it does use the Shadow design, which refers to a lower profile to reduce the likelihood of damage from obstacles on the trail.</p>\n<h3>Shimano Acera M3000</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Acera is most likely to be fitted to budget mountain bikes but features more tech than Altus.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Shimano</i></span></div>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?id=489797&amp;clickref=bikeradar-0&amp;awinmid=2698&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chainreactioncycles.com%2Fs%3Fq%3Dshimano%2Bacera%26cat%3Ddirect\" target=\"_blank\">Acera</a> follows next.

Another perk of Di2 is sequential shifting, AKA Synchro Shift, whereby both the front and rear derailleurs are operated with a single control, and the system decides whether to shift at the front or rear for the next closest jump.</p>\n<p>The Deore XT M8050 Di2 groupset shares the same crankset, cassette, chain and brakes of the respective XT 11-speed mechanical groupsets.</p>\n<h3>Shimano Deore XT M8100</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The full Shimano XT M8100 groupset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Shimano</i></span></div>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<p>Shimano <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-xt-m8100-vs-shimano-slx-m7100/\">Deore XT</a> sits one rung below the professional-grade XTR group.

There’s a wide-range 1×12 drivetrain with a massive 10-51t cassette, a tighter range 1×12 drivetrain with a 10-45t cassette, a 2×12 drivetrain with a 10-45t cassette, and a 1×11 option designed to save weight with a 10-45t cassette.</p>\n<p>In the past, XTR was split into Race and Trail categories.
