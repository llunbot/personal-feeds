And there is, I think, a narrative that links all those events together. Not a detailed account. But a story of how the details fit together.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I enjoyed this essay tremendously. This line, in particular, has stuck with me for the last week: “Expectations always move slower than facts.”</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/12/02/housel-how-all-this-happened\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6161891635de6225c839ee6e52c884bb6bd9d55ee2d16761b1676180d88986c8","category":"Tech"}
