Concave? Why not both? While the internet argues about which pedal design provides the best grip and feel, OneUp has been testing prototypes of their new profile since 2022. Since then, the brand has tried eight different versions of the concept, finally dialing it in to what they think is the next big evolution in pedal design – the Wave. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_WaveAnglesGraphic.gif\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"769\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_WaveAnglesGraphic-1536x769.gif\" alt=\"OneUp Wave pedal\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_WaveAnglesGraphic-1536x769.gif 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_WaveAnglesGraphic-297x149.gif 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_WaveAnglesGraphic-120x60.gif 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_WaveAnglesGraphic-768x384.gif 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_WaveLineGraphic.gif\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"769\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_WaveLineGraphic-1536x769.gif\" alt=\"OneUp Wave pedal\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_WaveLineGraphic-1536x769.gif 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_WaveLineGraphic-297x149.gif 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_WaveLineGraphic-120x60.gif 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_WaveLineGraphic-768x384.gif 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at the Wave pedal in profile, the front half of the pedal has a concave shape, while the rear of the pedal is sloped back from the axle in a more convex shape. OneUp says that this allows the front of the pedal to hug your foot, holding it in place, and acts to prevent your foot from sliding forward. It also makes it easier to readjust your foot position without taking your shoe off the pedal completely. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The back half of the pedal is sloped in order to “promote an aggressive heels-down foot position for more power and control.” The combination of the two halves is said to keep your feet in place better, without resorting to longer, sharper pins since the shape of the pedal is doing more to hold your foot in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the pedal is designed to be angled when riding, the pins are actually angled too. Looking at the pedal flat, the pins are angled up to 10º so that when the pedal angles down in a riding position, they become vertical. Pedals come with 9 hollow-hex pins per side, but there is a 10th hole to add another pin if desired. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_BearingsAxle.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_BearingsAxle-1536x768.webp\" alt=\"OneUp Wave pedal bearing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_BearingsAxle-1536x768.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_BearingsAxle-297x149.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_BearingsAxle-120x60.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_BearingsAxle-768x384.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_BearingsAxle.webp 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside, you’ll find a new bearing and axle system with igus bushings and three cartridge bearings per pedal and a chromoly axle that is DH and e-bike rated. It’s nice that these use the same bearings, bushings, and seals as the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/oneup-components-new-do-it-all-clip-pedals/\">OneUp Clip pedals</a>, for better part availability. Also, a pedal bearing Nut Tool is included with every pedal so riders can do their own maintenance at home. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_ColourRange_PressRelease.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"851\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_ColourRange_PressRelease-1536x851.webp\" alt=\"OneUp Wave pedal colors\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_ColourRange_PressRelease-1536x851.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_ColourRange_PressRelease-297x165.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_ColourRange_PressRelease-120x66.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_ColourRange_PressRelease-768x425.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_ColourRange_PressRelease.webp 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Specs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 355g (Pair)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Thickness:</strong> Axle 14.2mm / Edges 11.5mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Size:</strong> 107mm x 110mm (W x L)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bearing configuration: </strong>Inboard igus™ Bushing and 3x outboard cartridge bearings</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Body:</strong> Forged and CNC’d 6061 Aluminum Body</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Axle:</strong> Chromoly Steel with Black ED coating</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pins:</strong> M4 Hollow Pin 10 x pins per side (<em>self-cleaning hex through hole</em>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Colors: </strong>Black, Red, Dark Green, Dark Blue, Orange, Purple, Grey, Bronze</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pricing</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>US – $159.99</li>\n\n\n\n<li>CAD -$ 199.99</li>\n\n\n\n<li>UK – £149.99</li>\n\n\n\n<li>EU – €174.99</li>\n\n\n\n<li>ROW – $186.99</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In stock and available now. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/oneup-wave-pedal-hybrid-concave-convex-shape/\">OneUp Pedals Get Wavy with Hybrid Concave + Convex Shape</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"5cca1d9bbd52b6676e2b88dc3847272d4fae307ca27b1bf391dd9b6353d41b9a","category":"Cycling"}
