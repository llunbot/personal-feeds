{"title":"‘This is just the beginning’ - The fall and rise of Charlotte Kool","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/this-is-just-the-beginning-the-fall-and-rise-of-charlotte-kool","date":1723480887000,"content":"\n      <p>The career of a professional bike rider is built on a series of moments. Each of these moments has the potential to change things – sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. There are moments that cause scars: the squeal of brakes, the touch of wheels, the clattering to the tarmac, which can cut seasons short and leave riders wondering if it is all really worth it. Then, there are the moments that do the opposite. Yellow jerseys, bunches of flowers, podium ceremonies, celebrations with teammates – these are the moments that matter the most. For Charlotte Kool, the first stage of the <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tour-de-france-femmes-preview?srsltid=AfmBOopZOymTDzRih7PRt_PrGIuoml9ZcCFBuOgxnDbu_uRRHamnQp_U\">Tour de France Femmes avec Zwift</a> was one of the best she will ever have.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p>When she crossed the finish line ahead of her rivals under the baking sun that shone down on The Hague today, the Team dsm-firmenich PostNL rider’s relief was palpable. Her hand flew to her mouth when she realised what she’d done, and she shook her head in disbelief. Once she found her way past the gaggles of journalists and photographers, Kool threw her bike to a soigneur and lowered herself onto the hot tarmac, and as she sat there, she cried and cried. There haven’t been many victories this season, and she wasn’t the favourite to win today with the firepower of Lorena Wiebes and SD Worx-Protime. But, in front of a home crowd and against the odds, Kool had done it. The moment was created, and it will never be forgotten.<br /><br /></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Tornanti_cc-20240812-153524-TDFFAZ-ST01-9258F_1024x1024.jpg?v=1723480813\" /></div>\n<p>Her teammates hugged her, and there was more emotion: Team dsm-firmenich PostNL had won this stage together through hours of lead-out practice and constant discussions about self-belief and perseverance. There were times when the team felt like they couldn’t find the way to translate Kool’s podium finishes into first places – it seemed like she did not have the speed to finish off their well-drilled lead-out train. Today, any doubts were silenced.<br /><br />“We worked really hard up until today. We’ve had a difficult start to the season, we were always there but always second. We focused a lot on this day at home in front of our team, sponsors, and fans, it was amazing,” Kool’s final lead-out rider, Rachele Barbieri, commented after the finish line, her eyes shining with emotion. “It was hard, but we kept believing in each other. The biggest strength of this team is that we work so hard for each other. We will keep this strength for the future. This is just the beginning.”<br /><br />Pfeiffer Georgi, the team’s road captain, echoed Barbieri’s sentiment: “I think this means everything to Charlotte. Last year was tough, coming so close to a stage win, and this year she’s had a difficult start with a lot of second places. When you’re a sprinter you always want to win,” Georgi said. “She’s someone who keeps working hard and always has confidence in herself, and that’s what really made the difference today. We’ve been working on it all year. Earlier this season, we did a recon of the stage and looked at all the key points, and that really helped today.”<br /><br />Once Kool had thanked the likes of Barbieri and Georgi for their work after the stage at the finish, her eyes began to search the crowd for someone else. She found the face she was looking for when she spotted her grandma watching by the side of the road, and they embraced her in a moment that would have caused even the most stony-hearted of cycling fans to have glassy eyes.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Tornanti_cc-20240812-153720-TDFFAZ-ST01-1753E_1024x1024.jpg?v=1723480841\" /></div>\n<p><br />“My grandad was my biggest fan, and sadly, he died two years ago,” Kool explained after the race. “But my grandad gave everything to me. Even when I came last, he would cry because he was so proud of me – it didn’t matter how shit I was, he would support me. After every race, I'd call him. My grandma is having a tough time because they were so in love, and he was her partner for life. This win was for him.”<br /><br />Kool’s victory today was not only a pivotal moment for her but also for those around her. It gave the hundreds of Dutch fans who lined the roads of today’s stage something to cheer for, it gave her grandma a chance to remember, and it repaid her team for the work they have done for her this season. This is the kind of impact that winning a stage and yellow jersey in the Tour de France has.<br /><br />“The team always supports me, especially the girls. I try to be thankful and they are always there for me and know I want to do better. They really support me in this and say keep believing, the Tour will be your day,” Kool commented after the stage. “This season was all about this goal, so all the second places don't count any more.”<br /><br />For bike riders, moments like a Tour de France stage win come around rarely – there are always more disappointments than there are victories. As Kool experienced today, however, the feeling of winning is so richly satisfying that it’s what keeps professional athletes wanting more. By the end of her interviews and press conferences today, Kool had gathered herself, and the moment of victory had begun to pass. <br /><br />Her and her teammates’ were already starting to think of the next moment and how to find these feelings again. Kool allowed herself to bask in the glory for some time, but tomorrow, there will be another sprint. She needs to turn herself back into a fierce competitor – no more tears or hugs, back to being ice cool. Her teammate Georgi didn’t take long to admit it: “She wants another stage win tomorrow now,” the British rider grinned. For a winning team, there are always more moments to chase.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"1c8c0b2453bfcb2a8bc52668266d0510ab13645f003f74d465f5bfc18aded36b","category":"Cycling"}
