Earlier this year we saw <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/video-time-to-buy-an-e-bike-is-one-entertaining-ad/\" target=\"_blank\">Trek contract the YouTube genius of IFHT</a> to produce an advert. <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/07/vanmoof-ebike-ad-banned-in-france/\" target=\"_blank\">Vanmoof created such desire in its ad</a> that it was banned in France over concerns of what it would do to the automotive industry. And then there was the time <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJETokbfnNI\" target=\"_blank\">Grandma Joan put Peter Sagan to the sword</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now Serial 1, an off-shoot e-bike brand of Harley-Davidson, is throwing its hat into the ring of impressively well-produced and entertaining ads in the name of selling bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given I just sat through a nine-minute-long advert with a Ben Stiller-esque character and <em>still</em> felt compelled to share it, I’d say the recruited advertising agency has done its job. E-bike or not, I think we all know someone who could use a visit from a bike guru in their life. </p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/11/is-this-the-best-e-bike-advert-yet/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dave Rome","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"331ca224cbf50adffc1362d492930d95c9d56acdf7eb15f1118982557a0cb567","category":"Cycling"}
