This week saw the debut of two new rockets, a suborbital lifter from a German startup, and a new variant of the Long March 6 from China's state-owned launch provider. We also got within two hours of the debut of a crewed launch of Boeing's Starliner vehicle, but a rocket issue forced a 10-day delay. Soon, hopefully.</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site).

There were 63 orbital launch attempts worldwide in the first quarter of 2024, which is 10 more than the same time last year, <a href=\"https://payloadspace.com/2024-q1-orbital-launches-by-country/?oly_enc_id=9796C0398467A4S\">Payload reports</a>. SpaceX accounted for 32 of the 34 US orbital launch attempts in Q1. One ULA Vulcan launch and one Rocket Lab Electron launch out of Wallops rounded out the remaining total. (Rocket Lab flights out of New Zealand are not counted in US launch totals.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023055#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023055&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"61f5601483f69d399c27162a59180558b595fd04a101a578790f741033132727","category":"Tech"}
