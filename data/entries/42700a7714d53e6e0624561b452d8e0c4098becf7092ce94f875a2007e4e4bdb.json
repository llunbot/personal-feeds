The FCC said the action is \"a first in space debris enforcement\" and part of its increased focus on satellite policy that included the establishment of a <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-votes-establish-space-bureau-office-international-affairs\">Space Bureau</a>. The FCC added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The FCC's investigation found that the company violated the Communications Act, the FCC rules, and the terms of the company's license by relocating its direct broadcast satellite (\"DBS\") service EchoStar-7 satellite at the satellite's end-of-mission to a disposal orbit well below the elevation required by the terms of its license. At this lower altitude, it could pose orbital debris concerns.</p></blockquote>\n<p>FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Loyaan Egal called the consent decree \"a breakthrough settlement, making very clear the FCC has strong enforcement authority and capability to enforce its vitally important space debris rules.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972812#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972812&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"42700a7714d53e6e0624561b452d8e0c4098becf7092ce94f875a2007e4e4bdb","category":"Tech"}
