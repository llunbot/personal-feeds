The clock, which is only available to Nintendo Online subscribers until January 2025, changes appearance based on the selected alarm, with different clock faces corresponding to various Nintendo games like <em>Super Mario</em> Odyssey, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, and <em>Splatoon 3</em>.</p>\n<p>Unlike other sleep trackers that require you to physically wear something (such as the Apple Watch), Alarmo uses millimeter-wave presence sensors to track user movement, and it feeds that data into an internal system that keeps track of user sleep patterns (Alarmo does not send any sleep information to Nintendo).</p>\n<p>The clock tracks how long the person has been sleeping and how long it took them to get out of bed after the alarm went off. Sleepy users can also use gestures to trigger a snooze function without physically touching the clock.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/nintendos-new-clock-tracks-your-movement-in-bed/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/nintendos-new-clock-tracks-your-movement-in-bed/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"082358e6a2ff09db9f1ba6478a39b3660a549a26d6235b7aadba41eb8bc570f5","category":"Tech"}
