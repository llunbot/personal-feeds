The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ models are rumored to be around 8.725mm thick, and as you can see, it's really noticeable up close. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nImpressively, the slimmer device is almost as thin as the buttons on the sides. Rumors suggest that Apple will use a titanium and aluminum chassis for the ‌iPhone‌ to ensure it's strong enough not to bend. No-one wants another iPhone 6 Plus <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/23/iphone-6-plus-bending-pockets/\">\"bendgate\" scenario</a> – least of all Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iphone-17-dummies-sonny-e1745485948795.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1101\" height=\"586\" />\r<br />\nInitially, Apple had designs on making the iPhone 17 Air bigger than its expected 6.6-inch size, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/larger-iphone-17-air-referred-to-prototype/\">reportedly decided against it</a> because the larger display would make it prone to bending. It suggests Apple has really gone the extra mile in terms of the device's durability.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo achieve this level of thinness, Apple is believed to have settled on a single rear camera to preserve space for the battery, and it is embracing eSIM worldwide to do away with the sim slot. The handset will also use Apple's ultra-efficient custom-designed C1 modem that recently debuted in the iPhone 16e. Altogether, we're expected battery life to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/iphone-17-air-price-battery-life-more/\">equal that of current iPhone models</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iphone-17-dummies-sonny-d-e1745485975355.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1435\" height=\"696\" />\r<br />\nApple is expected to launch the iPhone 17 series around its usual mid-September timeframe, likely alongside <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/18/airpods-pro-3-upgrades-worth-waiting-for/\">new AirPods Pro 3 earbuds</a>.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/iphone-17-air-thin-as-buttons/\">iPhone 17 Air Almost as Thin as Its Buttons, New Images Show</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-air-almost-as-thin-as-its-buttons-new-images-show.2455867/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"70c76c42a73cb3349540a717149eae98a9c9b45eca9a7d6ec50fa8598f5988eb","category":"Apple"}
