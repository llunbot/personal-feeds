This also includes both S/M and M/L band sizes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBest Buy also has cellular models of the Apple Watch Series 9 at best-ever prices. You can get the 41mm Cellular model for <a href=\"https://howl.me/clCSmJRGjPH\"><strong>$409.00</strong></a> and the 45mm Cellular model for <a href=\"https://howl.me/clyFvAK7DJA\"><strong>$439.00</strong></a>, both of which are $90 markdowns. Stock on cellular models is much more strained, so you'll only find a few aluminum colors on sale at these prices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs of last month, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-sales-ban-reinstated/\">sales ban was reenacted</a> in the United States on any Apple Watch model sold by Apple that has blood oxygen sensing. While Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models purchased directly from Apple currently come with blood oxygen sensing disabled, retailers like Best Buy are able to continue selling through their existing stocks that include the feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you are looking for cheaper Apple Watches, you can also get the Apple Watch SE on sale at Best Buy, all of which are at $60 off.
