Fox Racing has coined the term while introducing their new Purevue goggle, which is designed specifically for MTB riders wearing open-faced helmets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fox wants trail riders to enjoy the protection and wide field-of-view full-face helmet/goggle combos typically offer, but with tons of airflow to prevent condensation while climbing and to keep you much cooler than normal goggles (and especially a full-face helmet) would.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fox PureVue Trail Goggles – Features:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-on-handlebars.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-on-handlebars.jpg\" alt=\"Fox Purevue trail goggles, on handlebars\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-on-handlebars.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-on-handlebars-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-on-handlebars-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-on-handlebars-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-on-handlebars-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-on-handlebars-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Purevue is Fox’s most breathable and highest clarity goggle available. The frames are made from lightweight and durable injected plastic. The frame design optimizes airflow, and offers great peripheral vision. They should offer a secure fit, and work seamlessly with Fox’s Speedframe helmet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bearing some similarities to <strong><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/leatt-gravity-6-0-full-face-helmet-velocity-4-x-flow-goggles/\">Leatt’s X-Flow 4.0 goggle</a></strong>, the Purevue’s top is left almost completely open for maximum ventilation. The lower part of the frame is heavily cut away, essentially leaving just two cheek pads and a nose bridge. One new feature Fox brings to the table is that you can ride the Purevue goggle with the nose bridge removed for the most possible airflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The frames feature three layer foam to ensure a comfortable, snug fit. The Purevue goggles are designed to fit closer to your face than typical goggles, which helps ensure good peripheral vision. A silicone gripper on the inside of the strap helps keep the goggles in place on your helmet shell.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>VIVID Lenses:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-rider-pushing-bike.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-rider-pushing-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Fox Purevue trail goggles, rider pushing bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-rider-pushing-bike.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-rider-pushing-bike-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-rider-pushing-bike-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-rider-pushing-bike-768x432.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Purevue is the first Fox goggle to offer VIVID lens technology, which provides high-contrast vision in challenging light conditions. This includes speckled light in forests, foggy conditions, or quick transitions from light to dark. While they are not photochromic, VIVID lens technology blocks the spectrum of light that creates flat light conditions, and improves the contrast and color of the trail. This allows the rider to see the trail and surrounding terrain more clearly with less eye strain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>VIVID lenses also have an anti-fog coating, and by this fall they will be available for all Fox Racing eyewear including Vue, Airspace and Main goggles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the VIVID lens, Fox offers grey and gold mirrored lens options for the Purevue goggles. To minimize visual distortion, the Purevue lenses feature aToric shape, meaning they are curved from top-to-bottom and side-to-side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching lenses looks pretty easy, with a little tug on the frame they simply snap in and out like many other sunglasses do.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Model Lineup and Pricing:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-rider-jumping.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-rider-jumping.jpg\" alt=\"Fox Purevue trail goggles, rider, jump\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-rider-jumping.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-rider-jumping-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-rider-jumping-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-rider-jumping-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-rider-jumping-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Purevue-goggles-rider-jumping-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Images c.
