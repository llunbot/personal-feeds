They provide better stopping power and modulation and more consistent performance in all weathers than <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/disc-brakes-vs-rim-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know\">rim brakes</a>. They’re also less prone to contamination, don’t eat through your bike’s rims and have allowed riders to fit much <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/are-wider-tyres-faster\">wider tyres </a>that wouldn’t fit in a rim brake calliper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But disc brakes aren’t without their downsides. They require more specialised maintenance than rim brakes, including periodic <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-bleed-shimano-hydraulic-road-disc-brakes\">bleeding </a>for hydraulic systems. It’s also harder to spot when disc brake pads need replacing than it is for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike-brake-pads\">rim brake pads</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disc brake pads come in a bewildering array of shapes too, although the range for road and gravel bikes is more limited. There’s the brake compound to consider, with options that are better suited for different conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll run through the different disc brake pads available and suggest the best alternatives to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-groupsets\">groupset </a>makers’ own pads from aftermarket brands.

In general, you should replace your disc brake pads when there’s less than 1mm of pad material left on the metal carrier. Always do so before the pad material itself is so worn down that the metal plate is rubbing on the rotor, as this will cause damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to check that the pad has worn evenly and is properly aligned with the rotor. If you use a bike workshop, they should check the pads for you during a service, but you should check periodically yourself too between services.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do I know which shape to buy?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SwissStop-brake-pad-guide-970x674.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SwissStop-brake-pad-guide-970x674.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SwissStop-brake-pad-guide-300x209.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SwissStop-brake-pad-guide-768x534.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SwissStop-brake-pad-guide-750x521.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SwissStop-brake-pad-guide-1140x793.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SwissStop-brake-pad-guide.jpg 1168w\" /><figcaption>SwissStop</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a bewildering range of different pad sizes and shapes available to fit different brake calliper models. Fortunately, there are relatively few designed for road/gravel bikes; one shape only for Shimano, one for Campagnolo and just two for SRAM road disc brakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your bike has non-road brake callipers or brakes from another brand, there are many more options. There’s no substitute for visually checking the size and shape of your replacement pad against your worn out one. <a href=\"https://www.swissstop.com/brakepads/discbrakes/\" target=\"_blank\">SwissStop</a> helps out by offering a life-size download of every pad it sells, which you can print out to check compatibility, and other brands offer similar tools to help you to make sure you’ve got the right pad.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s the difference between pad materials?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"718\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SRAM-disc-brake-pads.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SRAM-disc-brake-pads.jpg 718w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SRAM-disc-brake-pads-300x181.jpg 300w\" /><figcaption>SRAM</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two main types of disc brake pad: organic pads, also called resin pads, and sintered pads, also called metal pads. They have different braking and wear characteristics and are better for different conditions.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organic pads are most typically fitted in brakes when bikes are sold. They give you a quick initial braking response and are relatively quiet in operation. They’re also quick to break in and the braking material tends to insulate the calliper and the brake fluid from heat build-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They do wear faster than sintered pads though, particularly when riding in wet and dirty conditions. They’re also more likely to fade with prolonged braking and they can glaze over, when they’ll need to be reconditioned to restore braking effectiveness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sintered pads are made of metal, which makes them more durable than organic pads. They don’t wear as fast in adverse riding conditions, they’re not prone to glazing and they handle higher temperatures better and provide stronger hard braking power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, their initial braking response is slower and less modulated and they take longer to warm up and be fully effective than organic pads. The metal surface transfers more heat to the brake calliper and brake fluid and they’re more prone to brake squeal than organic pads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So organic pads are a better option for summer road riding, while sintered pads might be a better choice for winter conditions and gravel riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM says that you should replace your rotors at the same time, if you swap between organic and sintered pad materials, to ensure optimum performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a third option, semi-metallic pads, which are made of an organic compound, but with metal particles incorporated to increase durability. They offer many of the pros of the other two options, but also the cons, plus they’re usually more expensive than either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, brake pad makers Amp and Ashima sell ceramic pads, which they say provide long life, wet weather and high temperature performance and low noise, but at the expense of slower bite and a higher price.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are Shimano, SRAM and Campagnolo pads interchangeable?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In a word, no. Each brand has its own pad shape that’s unique to its callipers. SRAM makes things more complex, as it swapped the shape of its disc brake pads between the 11-speed and 12-speed groupset generations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other brands selling disc brakes for road and gravel bikes, such as TRP/Tektro, also have their own unique pad shape, although some pads may be cross-compatible with Shimano. Check pad manufacturers’ sites for pad compatibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-disc-brake-pads\">Best disc brake pads 2025 for road and gravel bikes plus buying advice</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"fec0eddb2a812f5fba01c9fe482b83093619e374d2f5299511d3719012f63e74","category":"Cycling"}
