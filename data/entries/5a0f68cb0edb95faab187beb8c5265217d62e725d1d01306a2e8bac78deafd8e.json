If you make a bunch of confusing changes to Control Center and don't want to go through the trouble of moving everything around, you can now use the reset option to get back to the default options that Apple provides when installing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has also added separate Control Center connectivity controls for Wi-Fi and VPN connectivity. In prior versions of ‌iOS 18‌, these controls were baked into an all-in-one connectivity button, but now they can be added to the Control Center. The new Wi-Fi and VPN options cannot be added to the Lock Screen or the Action Button.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlmost all connectivity controls can now be added individually, including Airplane Mode, Cellular Data, Personal Hotspot, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and VPN. AirDrop and Satellite are not available as standalone controls.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/control-center/\">Control Center</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/ios-18-1-control-center-changes/\">Latest iOS 18.1 Beta Adds Control Center Reset and New Connectivity Options</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/latest-ios-18-1-beta-adds-control-center-reset-and-new-connectivity-options.2437841/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5a0f68cb0edb95faab187beb8c5265217d62e725d1d01306a2e8bac78deafd8e","category":"Apple"}
