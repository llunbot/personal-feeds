The iPhone was in a case and had a screen protector, and Bates found the iPhone under a bush that seemingly helped break the phone’s fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bates reported the finding to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and an agent mentioned that the iPhone was one of two mobile phones from the flight that was found. No reports have been made on the condition of the other phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Find My functionality in iOS needs Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular connectivity to work, but Airplane mode, by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/travel-with-iphone-iphb771143ee/ios&amp;xcust=1-1-2195138-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">default in iOS</a>, turns off this connectivity. So using Find My to locate the phone would have been unsuccessful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On January 5, a Boeing 737 Max 9 plane took off from Portland International Airport and reached 16,000 feet in the air when a door became detached from the plane, causing a depressurization of the cabin.
