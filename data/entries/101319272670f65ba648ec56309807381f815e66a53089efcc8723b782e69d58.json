It is called the Tom Waits Principle.</p>\n<p>I thought about that principle constantly while I was trying to open myself up to <a href=\"https://www.mw5clans.com/\"><em>MechWarrior 5: Clans</em></a>. Trying to jump into this game and like it, so that I'd have some critical assessment of it, was akin to handing a friend <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Rider_(album)\">The Black Rider</a>Â </em>and assuming they would come back begging for more.</p>\n<p>From everything I can tell and what I have read, this game largely delivers on the simulation, and notably a lot of the story, that <em>BattleTech</em>/<em>MechWarrior</em> fans revere. <em>Clans</em> seems very good at what it sets out to do, and I do get the sense that it is relatively accommodating to newcomers compared to other entries. It just did not, despite its stand-alone nature and alleged newcomer friendliness, convert me into a loadout tactician or stomp-and-shoot enthusiast.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/i-tried-to-get-into-mechwarrior-5-clans-as-a-newcomer-but-its-for-the-fans/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/i-tried-to-get-into-mechwarrior-5-clans-as-a-newcomer-but-its-for-the-fans/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"101319272670f65ba648ec56309807381f815e66a53089efcc8723b782e69d58","category":"Tech"}
