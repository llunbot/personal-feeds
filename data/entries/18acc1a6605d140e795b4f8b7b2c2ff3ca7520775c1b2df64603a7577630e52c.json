But with skepticism about durability, pricing, image quality, and the necessity of such devices, foldable screens aren't mainstream. With those concerns in mind, I haven't had much interest in owning a foldable-screen gadget, even after <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/hp-shows-what-a-foldable-screen-laptop-should-and-shouldnt-be/\">using a foldable laptop for a month</a>. However, the foldable portable monitor that Asus is showing at CES in Las Vegas this week is an application of foldable OLED that makes more sense to me <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/motorola-demos-smartphone-that-can-wrap-around-your-wrist-again/\">than others</a>.</p>\n<p>Asus' ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH announced on Tuesday is a 17.3-inch portable monitor that can fold to a 12.5-inch size. The monitor has 2560Ã—1920 pixels for a pixel density of 184.97 pixels per inch. Other specs include a 100 percent DCI-P3 coverage claim and VESA DisplayHDR True Black 500 certification.</p>\n<p>When I think of the ways I use portable monitors, foldability makes more sense than it does with other device types. For example, I love working outside when possible, and an extra 17.3-inch screen that's easy to carry would make long work sessions with an ultraportable laptop more feasible. The Fold OLED's 17.3 inches is near the larger size for a portable monitor, but the fold and comparatively light weight should make it feel more transportable than similarly sized monitors that don't fold in half.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994880#p3\">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994880&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"18acc1a6605d140e795b4f8b7b2c2ff3ca7520775c1b2df64603a7577630e52c","category":"Tech"}
