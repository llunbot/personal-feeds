To make this push toward global developers worthwhile, Apple needs to make the Vision Pro available in non-U.S. markets before the event. Making the headset available internationally before WWDC would apparently enable Apple to promote a \"global development ecosystem\" for ‌visionOS‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo explained that Apple's reasoning for keeping sales of the Vision Pro exclusive to the United States at first is due to limited supply, a wish to ensure that the sales process goes smoothly before expanding it, and to provide time to modify its software to be suitable for other countries. Once these issues have been resolved, Kuo believes the Vision Pro will go on sale in more countries.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has hosted WWDC in early June every year since 2007, so it is highly likely to fall at the same time again this year. Earlier this month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> said that the launch of Vision Pro in other countries around the world <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/gurman-vision-pro-launch-imminent/\">will not \"actually be that much later\"</a> than its release in the United States. Apple is said to be considering the United Kingdom, Canada, and China as the next markets to receive the product.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is not clear how much supply will be available in the rest of the world by the time the Vision Pro goes on sale outside the United States. With <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/11/kuo-vision-pro-sellout-likely/\">only 80,000 units</a> expected to be available upon launch in the U.S., the headset is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/kuo-apple-vision-pro-may-sell-out-fast/\">expected to sell out quickly</a> and thereafter be subject to long shipping delays.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-to-launch-internationally-before-wwdc/\">Kuo: Apple Vision Pro to Launch Internationally Before WWDC 2024</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-vision-pro-to-launch-internationally-before-wwdc-2024.2416482/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"67af9c56db8c800ef4e68ddae2a941e877ada82d114b51fbc42b70b3db264820","category":"Apple"}
