The change came into effect at the end of June just before the Tour de France, and the squad has raced as Qhubeka NextHash ever since. Assos remained on as a kit sponsor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is not certain which of the squad’s sponsors is responsible for the payment “delay” in question, according to Cyclingnews, Assos has said that it “can confirm we have fulfilled our commitments to the program and much more and hope that the team can continue to 2022 and beyond.”</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/qhubeka-nexthash-riders-and-staff-have-reportedly-not-yet-been-paid-august-salaries/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"2ab4ca81e86b87ce422c6929f454238d7cc12f16668ae7e1baedfca70f39444a","category":"Cycling"}
