It's a fan tribute that melds the design sensibilities of the 1993 Game Boy classic <em>Zelda: Link's Awakening</em> with the storyline of the original Star Wars trilogy.</p>\n<p>In the pixel art, Shoehead depicts a title screen and eight key scenes that reflect important events in <em>A New Hope</em>, <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>, and <em>Return of the Jedi</em>. The scenes include watching the \"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi\" sequence with the Jedi master, an encounter with a Wampa on Hoth, a Darth Vader boss battle, evading the Rancor monster, getting zapped by the Emperor, and seeing the Force ghosts of Anakin, Yoda, and Obi-Wan at the end of <em>Return of the Jedi</em>.</p>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/luke1.jpg\" alt /></div>\n          <p>\n            Fan-made mock-up title screen artwork for a fantasy <em>Star Wars: Luke's Awakening</em> game.
