Then it must obtain approval from Nasdaq. Leading global chipmakers, including Apple, Samsung Electronics, Nvidia and Intel, will invest in Arm as soon as the company is listed on the market.</blockquote>Arm plans to welcome the big chipmakers as medium- to long-term shareholders, selling them stakes of a few percent each. By holding Arm's shares, chipmakers will hope to have sway over Arm's management.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nJapan-based SoftBank has been preparing for an IPO since its plan to sell Arm to Nvidia became <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/02/ftc-lawsuit-block-nvidia-arm-acquisition/\">subject to regulatory scrutiny</a>. California-based Nvidia in January 2022 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/08/nvidia-abandons-arm-acquistion/\">abandoned</a> the purchase when it became clear that the deal would be blocked by the FTC. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nSince its founding in 1990, Arm has developed integrated circuit design data, considered the \"blueprint\" for semiconductors. Arm licenses its chip designs to over 500 companies, including Apple, and its architecture is used in 95 percent of the world's smartphones. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nArm's hardware underpins all of Apple's custom silicon processors such as the A15 in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> in the MacBook Pro, since Apple licenses the Arm instruction set.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/arm/\">Arm</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/08/apple-to-invest-in-arm-ipo/\">Apple to Invest in British Chip Designer Arm on Initial Public Offering</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-invest-in-british-chip-designer-arm-on-initial-public-offering.2398054/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"91083cce5325868188e207b3ff2a706adf4d3d0756079997798513dcbbbcca2c","category":"Apple"}
