{"title":"Jamison Foser on the Obsequiousness of The Washington Post Spiking Ann Telnaes’s Cartoon","link":"https://www.findinggravity.net/p/no-jeff-bezos-is-not-obeying-in-advance#footnote-1-154176323","date":1736113044000,"content":"\n<p>Jamison Foser:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Washington Post opinion editor David Shipley <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/business/media/washington-post-cartoonist-quits-after-jeff-bezos-cartoon-is-killed.html\">offered the kind of\nobviously-false explanation you only utter when you know admitting\nthe truth will make you look even worse</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>David Shipley, The Post’s opinions editor, said in a statement\nthat he respected Ms. Telnaes and all she had given to The Post\n“but must disagree with her interpretation of events.”</p>\n\n<p>“Not every editorial judgment is a reflection of a malign force,”\nMr. Shipley said in the statement. “My decision was guided by the\nfact that we had just published a column on the same topic as the\ncartoon and had already scheduled another column — this one a\nsatire — for publication. The only bias was against repetition.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Look, this is bullshit. It is risible to suggest that the world’s\nmost powerful billionaires — men who control Facebook, Amazon,\nThe Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, Disney, ABC News, and\nOpenAI — aligning themselves with an aspiring autocrat is\nunworthy of two columns (one satirical) and a drawing.</p>\n\n<p>And Shipley’s claim that the Post opinion section has a “bias …\nagainst repetition”? As I write this, at 8:50 pm on January 4 the\nmain page of the opinion section at WashingtonPost.com currently\nfeatures the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>“The 10 worst things Biden did in 2024” by Marc Thiessen</li>\n<li>“The 10 best things Biden did in 2024” by Marc Thiessen</li>\n<li>“Dave Barry’s 2024 year in review” by Dave Barry</li>\n<li>“24 good things that happened in 2024” by the Editorial Board</li>\n<li>“2025 promises to be tumultuous. Here’s our New Year’s\nresolution” by the Editorial Board</li>\n<li>“How poker players keep New Year’s resolutions” by Annie Duke</li>\n<li>“Classifying New Year’s resolutions,” a cartoon by Edith\nPritchett</li>\n<li>“Bringing in the New Year,” a cartoon by by Ann Telnaes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Clearly this is not an opinion section that has a “bias …\nagainst repetition.” Just as clearly, the Post’s explanation for\nspiking Telnaes’ cartoon is bullshit. It is a defense so\npreposterous it serves as unwitting acknowledgment of the most\nobvious — and damning — interpretation of the Post’s actions:\nThe Post spiked Telnaes’ cartoon because of its portrayal of\nPost owner Jeff Bezos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Foser further makes the point that the Post’s obsequiousness here is <em>not</em> toward Trump, but rather toward Bezos. In fact, if Trump has seen <a href=\"https://anntelnaes.substack.com/p/why-im-quitting-the-washington-post\">Telnaes’s cartoon</a>, he surely loves it. He might have it framed.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/05/fozer-wapo-obsequiousness\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"701ec7cd8bad9bf731567276fa0cd048e65b23c4ccf7ad8ea37ca9322768a62c","category":"Tech"}
