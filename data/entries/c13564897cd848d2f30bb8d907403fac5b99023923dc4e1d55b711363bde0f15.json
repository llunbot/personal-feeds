{"title":"Facing Reddit’s Exorbitant API Pricing, Christian Selig Is Shutting Down Apollo","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/","date":1686332226000,"content":"\n<p>Christian Selig, writing in r/apolloapp:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Eight years ago, I posted in the Apple subreddit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2u86mj/announcing_apollo_a_brand_new_gorgeous_reddit_app/\">about a Reddit\napp I was looking for beta testers for</a>, and my life\ncompletely changed that day. I just finished university and an\ninternship at Apple, and wanted to build a Reddit client of my\nown: a premier, customizable, well-designed Reddit app for iPhone.\nThis fortunately resonated with people immediately, and it’s been\nmy full time job ever since.</p>\n\n<p>Today’s a much sadder post than that initial one eight years ago.\nJune 30th will be Apollo’s last day.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve talked to a lot of people, and come to terms with this over\nthe last weeks as talks with Reddit have deteriorated to an ugly\npoint, and in the interest of transparency with the community, I\nwanted to talk about how I arrived at this decision, and if you\nhave any questions at the end, I’m more than happy to answer. This\npost will be long as I have a lot of topics to cover.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that I recorded all my calls with Reddit, so my\nstatements are not based on memory, but the recorded statements by\nReddit over the course of the year. One-party consent recording is\nlegal in my country of Canada. Also I won’t be naming names,\nthat’s not important and I don’t want to doxx people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Given what we knew about Reddit’s stance on this API pricing a week ago, this isn’t surprising, but it still feels tragic. Apollo — like Tweetbot and Twitterrific before it — isn’t merely a nice client for a particular service. It’s one of the best apps ever made, full stop.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s stop attributing this shutdown to “Reddit” the company, though, and pin responsibility where it truly lies: on Reddit CEO and co-founder Steve Huffman, personally. When Twitter killed third-party clients everyone naturally and correctly pinned responsibility on Elon Musk, because Musk is very famous and very much public in his stewardship of Twitter now that he owns it.</p>\n\n<p>I’ll bet many of you reading this, even Reddit users, couldn’t recall Reddit’s CEO’s name before I named Huffman above. But it’s clear from Selig’s description — and his receipts, as it were — that Huffman is intimately involved in this decision, and is not only responsible, but is actively besmirching Selig with provably false accusations of both extortion <em>and</em> shoddy engineering.</p>\n\n<p>Reddit didn’t kill Apollo. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman did.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s see if Huffman has the courage to go through with <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/144ho2x/join_our_ceo_tomorrow_to_discuss_the_api/\">this planned AMA today to discuss Reddit’s API policy changes</a>. I have one simple question for him: What do you think Reddit co-founder <a href=\"http://www.aaronsw.com/\">Aaron Swartz</a> would say about this if he were still alive?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/09/apollo-reddit-demise\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c13564897cd848d2f30bb8d907403fac5b99023923dc4e1d55b711363bde0f15","category":"Tech"}
