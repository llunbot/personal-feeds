When the box hit my doorstep, I couldn’t help but guffaw at what lay in wait. Affordable titanium?</p>\n<p>The suggestion, particularly in this economy, seems more like a poorly timed April Fool’s Day joke than a legitimate proposition. However, after spending some time with the new titanium All-Road, it’s clear the Phoenix, Arizona-based company isn’t done pushing the limit on approachable, modern bikes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_09.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"Titanium All-Road\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_09.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_09.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_09.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_09.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.statebicycle.com/collections/titanium-all-road-gravel-series\" target=\"_blank\">Titanium All-Road</a> Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>XS to XL sizing for riders from 5’1” to 6’4”</li>\n<li>700c x 50mm or 650b x 2.25”</li>\n<li>44mm 1 ⅛ straight head tube</li>\n<li>68mm BSA English Threaded BB</li>\n<li>12mm x 100mm / 12mm x 142mm hub spacing</li>\n<li>27.2mm seatpost</li>\n<li>1870g frame weight for size medium</li>\n<li>Frame: $1299.99</li>\n<li>Build kits from $2499.00 to $4400.00</li>\n<li>Build kit as reviewed: $4400.00 (SRAM Apex/GX mullet and ENVE AG25)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_30.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_30.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_30.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_30.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_30.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Truly All Road</h3>\n<p>While there’s been a bit of umm-ing and err-ing about what constitutes a gravel versus an all-road bike, State’s definition of all-road appears congruent with my own. Anything that could be considered a road should be more than comfortable on tires that fit the clearances for this frame. If it was at one point cleared, cut, graded, or constituted as a road, this bike should be able to handle it. And that’s great to see! While I don’t intend to get too in-depth here, I think there’s something to be said about the contextual moment of design regarding bikes. It seems the current moment has allowed for these kinds of clearances to exist closer to the mean. Irrespective of whether you intend to get gnarly, having this kind of tire clearance makes any bike all the more versatile.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_20.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1800\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_20.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_20.jpg?resize=1200,1800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_20.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_20.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2164\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_15.jpg?fit=1200,2164&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_15.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_15.jpg?resize=1200,1948&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_15.jpg?resize=768,1247&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_15.jpg?resize=946,1536&amp;quality=75 946w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_15.jpg?resize=1262,2048&amp;quality=75 1262w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_27.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_27.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_27.jpg?resize=1200,1800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_27.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_27.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w\" /></p>\n<h3>Exo(Ti)c</h3>\n<p>What doesn’t sit close to the mean is the price point. By my measure, most titanium frames, let alone frame and fork combos, sit well above the three-thousand and sometimes even five-thousand dollar mark. How State has managed to offer this frame and fork at such a competitive price is beyond me, but, it is interesting – dare I say, good – to see the scale production of a bike clearly targeted toward those looking for speed across varied terrain made out of something other than carbon.</p>\n<p>According to State, this frame is made from the “highest quality double-butted Gr9 3AL/2.5V titanium” and “combines the unmatched durability of titanium with the lightweight properties of carbon and the solid ride quality of steel.” While I’ve thus far only spent a few weeks aboard this new chassis, I’d say State’s description pretty much hits the mark.</p>\n<p>While the initial run of titanium All-Roads will be limited to just fifty bikes, the brand plans to evaluate the response to the price point and, potentially, make larger batches available for sale in the future. As State’s owner Mehdi Farsi told me candidly in a recent conversation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The idea here is to give people as good a chance to experience what they’re missing out on. The [pricing] margin is razor-thin with these frames. And we’re alright with that. We want to give the most bang for their buck in an attempt to show people what kind of product we’re making here at State.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_04.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"Titanium All-Road\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_04.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_04.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_04.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_04.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Build Options</h3>\n<p>Just like their other offerings, State has something of a tiered system in mind if you’re looking to purchase more than just a frame. With build kits featuring their OEM line of componentry to electrified, carbon wheel setup reviewed here, State has the full gambit of preset build options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Completes</strong> $2499.00 to $4400.00</li>\n<li><strong>SBC Build Base Price</strong> $2499.99</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels</strong> SBC 700c or 650b: Included; DT Swiss 700c or 650b: +$450; Enve 700c (AG25) or 650b (AG28): +$899</li>\n<li><strong>Groupsets</strong> SBC: Included; SRAM Apex XPLR AXS (11-44t): +$899; SRAM Apex / Eagle Mullet AXS (11-50t): +$999</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to all those options, customers can mix and match whatever options and upgrades work best for them straight from State. Since State assembles all the bikes to order in its Phoenix HQ, riders aren’t locked into a specific build tier. So, if you want the Apex Eagle Mullet with their in-house wheelset, select accordingly.</p>\n<p>What’s not listed here is the ability to add the State-branded gravel suspension fork. With 40mm of travel, State’s suspension fork aligns with the industry’s shift toward micro-suspension offerings for people looking further to blur the lines between their gravel and mountain bikes. While I’m sure many folks will have their say on that, the sheer number of options available from State make what is already a pretty open, accessible canvas even more so. When asked if there would be flat bar builds, Mehdi simply grinned and said, “Oh yeah.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_16.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"Titanium All-Road\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_16.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_16.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_16.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_16.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Initial Impressions</h3>\n<p>To say this bike is a departure from what I typically ride would be an understatement. My tastes tend toward thin-tubed, steel, rando-inspired designs, with my most recent riding experience being a week straight of loaded low-trail riding through the forests of rural Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>That withstanding, I am coming to find what I like about this kind of bike. Quick, snappy handling doesn’t entirely give way to the harsh emptiness found in carbon bikes I’ve ridden. While there is something of a thinness to the ride quality of titanium when compared to how bumps and chunky descents tend to smooth out on my full steel builds – it’s not an unpleasant sensation. Still, there is a noticeable damping over small bumps and the weight savings over steel is palatable. My first pedal strokes away from outside my steel rando comfort zone were frightful; the possibilities I experienced, even in a short time with a much snappier, lighter bike, lit up a world of potential.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_06.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"Titanium All-Road\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_06.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_06.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_06.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_06.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>State of the Union</h3>\n<p>In terms of how this bike fits into State’s current gravel and all-road offerings, this seems to be something of a<br />\npremium model for those looking to hit all of the meaningful concentric circles (light, strong, and capable). Though there’s no beating State when it comes to the value presented by their 4130 All-Road at $899 for a complete, and this price point point for a titanium frame is simply undeniable. As much as titanium has been unnecessarily fetishized, suggesting this is an endgame frame is not outlandish. The weight, quality, and capability make it something you can center a considered, long-term build around. For $1299, that’s pretty incredible – especially since it holds none of the question marks presented by long-term carbon fatigue.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2200\" height=\"1700\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-Titanium-All-Road-SizeSpec-2.jpg?fit=1200,1700&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-Titanium-All-Road-SizeSpec-2.jpg?w=2200&amp;quality=75 2200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-Titanium-All-Road-SizeSpec-2.jpg?resize=1200,927&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-Titanium-All-Road-SizeSpec-2.jpg?resize=2000,1545&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-Titanium-All-Road-SizeSpec-2.jpg?resize=768,593&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-Titanium-All-Road-SizeSpec-2.jpg?resize=1536,1187&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-Titanium-All-Road-SizeSpec-2.jpg?resize=2048,1583&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2200\" height=\"1700\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-Titanium-All-Road-SizeSpec-3.jpg?fit=1200,1700&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-Titanium-All-Road-SizeSpec-3.jpg?w=2200&amp;quality=75 2200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-Titanium-All-Road-SizeSpec-3.jpg?resize=1200,927&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-Titanium-All-Road-SizeSpec-3.jpg?resize=2000,1545&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-Titanium-All-Road-SizeSpec-3.jpg?resize=768,593&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-Titanium-All-Road-SizeSpec-3.jpg?resize=1536,1187&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024-Titanium-All-Road-SizeSpec-3.jpg?resize=2048,1583&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>Geometry-wise – if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. While it’s not a total match, especially when compared to their alloy or carbon All-Road models, State has typically erred toward safer, more relaxed geometry. It’s a bit longer and lower than the 4130, but not as aggressive as the alloy or carbon frames, putting it safely in the endurance road category as far as geometry goes, and comfortable all-day rider given the comforts provided by both the frame material and larger tires.</p>\n<p>With limited options in test bikes, I rode with the size large review model. While a size medium would have been more ideal, running less seatpost than perhaps intended and slamming the stem made it work. For reference, I’m 5’9” with somewhat longer arms and legs, so I tend toward larger bikes and am often between sizes. Particularly those that fall more within the traditional randonneuring category. That said, I don’t feel the bike suffered significantly from my setup. The handling was still responsive and snappy, and there were no deficiencies in the way of wheel flop or general instability to speak of. In addition to that, I found this to be one of the more comfortable 700c bikes I’ve ever ridden, given the way the lax geometry lends itself to corner hard, but fly on the flats. All in all, it’s something of a perfect center within their All-Road category.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_19.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"Titanium All-Road\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_19.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_19.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_19.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_19.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>That, however, is where State’s All-Road Ti stops sitting mid-pack. As I’ve said several times, this price point blows most, if not all, of the available competition out of the water. Unless significantly marked down, most, if not all, comparable titanium bikes on the market start at over two thousand dollars for a frameset. Whether Lynskey, Blackheart, Litespeed, or Bearclaw, whoever comes to mind, none of them come near this base price at MSRP. Whether that will hold up in terms of quality or long-term ride characteristics remains to be evaluated, but it’s hard to see past something so approachable. The water gets a bit muddier with the completes, especially once you delve into the pricier builds that include carbon wheels and electronic shifting. However, it’s still at the lower end of what can be expected for a complete titanium bike.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_02.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"Titanium All-Road\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_02.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_02.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_02.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/2024_State_Ti_02.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>With so many all-road and gravel offerings out there nowadays, bike companies really have to do something special to stand out from the slew of mid-to-high trail bikes available to consumers. Some choose to go down the path of added complexity, tacking on all kinds of new technology to up the ante on the bike tech arms race. To see State continue their M.O. of making solid to great bikes as affordable as possible is a nice change of pace. If nothing else, I think that’s a pretty admirable aim.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for a more in-depth review of State’s titanium all-road soon.
