Instead, it’s truly a sum of all its parts.</p>\n<p>Economies of scale have helped shave costs, though.</p>\n<p>Vitus and sibling brand Nukeproof suck up a large chunk of the OE market, and combined with parent company CRC/Wiggle’s buying power, it’s clear to see where at least some of the cost savings have been made.</p>\n<h2>Motoring on</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VRX electric enduro mountain bike Bafang M510 motor\" title=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VRX 7\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Bafang M510 motor has been tuned with help from Vitus.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Chinese electric motor company Bafang has made increasing headway into the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-mountain-bikes/\">electric mountain bikes</a> market.</p>\n<p>Initially offering <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bike-conversion-kits/\">ebike conversion kits</a>, it now partners with bike brands to supply OE motors; the most notable being Andorran brand <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/forestal-cyon-neon-review/\">Forestal</a>, with its EonDrive motor.</p>\n<p>Adding Vitus to the list of mainstream OE partners is a great move for Bafang, propelling it into the limelight.</p>\n<p>The M510 is specced on all the new E-Mythique LT models, producing up to 95Nm of torque and 550W peak power.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VRX electric enduro mountain bike Bafang display\" title=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VRX 6\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The screen displays key data clearly.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Vitus told us it worked closely with Banfang to co-develop the M510 motor’s tunes, adjusting and specifying each of its five factory-set modes.</p>\n<p>Those modes comprise Eco, Eco Plus, Trail, Boost and Race.</p>\n<p>Trail, like Shimano’s identically named mode, and Bosch’s Tour+ and eMTB settings, has assistance variability; the harder you pedal, the more assistance it delivers.</p>\n<p>Powering the motor is a 630Wh battery, integrated into the frame’s down tube.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VRX electric enduro mountain bike Bafang mode selector\" title=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VRX 5\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The switch is compact, helping it fit between the brake lever and grips.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Vitus told us the battery capacity balances weight and range, without needing to increase tube sizes to incorporate a bigger unit. During testing, the team at Vitus are said to have comfortably reached 1,800m of climbing on a single charge from mixed usage in the lower-powered modes.</p>\n<p>This equals and potentially beats the Shimano EP8’s average range, but is slightly less than the typical figures you can expect from a Bosch Performance Line CX motor with a bigger 750Wh battery.</p>\n<p>Vitus and Bafang also collaborated on the design and functionality of the display and mode buttons, helping improve their ergonomics.</p>\n<h2>All-new frame</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VRX electric enduro mountain bike internal cable routing\" title=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VRX 4\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Its cables are routed internally.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The E-Mythique LT’s 6061 T6 aluminium frame – despite looking like the E-Sommet – is an all-new design.</p>\n<p>Brake, dropper and gear cables are routed via ports on the side of the down tube, there are bottle boss mounts inside the front triangle and it uses <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/sram-udh/\">SRAM’s Universal Derailleur Hanger</a>, making it compatible with the brand’s latest Transmission gears.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, there’s chain-slap and underside protection.</p>\n<h2>Sussed-out suspension</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VRX electric enduro mountain bike\" title=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VRX 15\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The rear shock has been tuned specifically for the E-Mythique LT’s kinematics.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Tuned for enduro riding, the E-Mythique LT’s suspension has an overall progression rate of 27 per cent, making it suited to both <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/coil-vs-air/\">air- and coil-sprung</a> rear shocks, which was a big request from the brand’s customers.</p>\n<p>The leverage rate – that starts at 2.83 and finishes at 2.06 – is linearly progressive, with no curves or flat spots.</p>\n<p>This, Vitus claims, has made it much easier to tune the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-rear-shocks/\">rear shock</a>, and should make setup easier. From the factory, the shocks come with three volume reducers, which should give a plush initial feel and plenty of ramp-up.</p>\n<p>Anti-rise – how much braking forces cause the suspension to compress or extend – sits around 55 per cent. This means braking forces are more likely to cause it to extend than compress, essentially creating a more active on-the-brakes feel.</p>\n<p>Finally, anti-squat, which is how much pedalling and suspension forces interact with one another, sits just below 100 per cent at sag in a ‘climbing gear’. This means the rear suspension should remain fairly active on power, while only bobbing a minimal amount.</p>\n<h2>Performance-focused geometry is free</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VRX electric enduro mountain bike\" title=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VRX 2\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The three-model line-up tops out with this VRX bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Tuning the bike’s geometry to offer stable handling is a free upgrade, and one Vitus hopes will pay dividends on the trail by upping the scope of its budget-focused performer.</p>\n<p>Offered in four sizes (small to extra-large), the E-Mythique LT has modern, progressive geometry.</p>\n<p>Headlining is a 63.5-degree head angle and steep 77.5-degree seat tube angle (170mm fork), intended to create stability and comfort on descents and climbs.</p>\n<p>Reach figures span from 434mm up to 504mm (170mm fork) across the sizes, while chainstay lengths are fixed for each size at 445mm.</p>\n<div>\n                <table><caption>All figures quoted for 170mm travel E-Mythique LT</caption>\n                <colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>﻿Size</th><th>Small</th><th>Medium</th><th>Large</th><th>Extra-large</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Head angle</b> (degrees)</td><td>63.5</td><td>63.5</td><td>63.5</td><td>63.5</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Seat tube angle</b> (degrees)</td><td>77.5</td><td>77.5</td><td>77.5</td><td>77.5</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Seat tube length</b> (mm)</td><td>380</td><td>410</td><td>440</td><td>480</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Effective top tube length</b> (mm)</td><td>573</td><td>591</td><td>619</td><td>649</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Bottom bracket drop</b> (mm)</td><td>26</td><td>26</td><td>26</td><td>26</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Wheelbase</b> (mm)</td><td>1,224</td><td>1,244</td><td>1,275</td><td>1,307</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Chainstay length</b> (mm)</td><td>445</td><td>445</td><td>445</td><td>445</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Stack height</b> (mm)</td><td>630</td><td>638</td><td>648</td><td>657</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Reach</b> (mm)</td><td>434</td><td>450</td><td>476</td><td>504</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<p>The size large’s stack height is 648mm, while bottom bracket drop is 26mm.

Below are his thoughts.</em></p>\n<p>Weighing in at a chunky 25.44kg (size large), it’s fortunate the E-Mythique LT VRX hides its weight well on steep, gnarly trails.</p>\n<p>In part, that’s thanks to its slack head angle and well-proportioned reach, chainstay and wheelbase figures that place you centrally between its wheels, aiding control.</p>\n<p>It’s also down to the impressively supportive suspension.</p>\n<p>With kinematics generating plenty of progression, combined with volume-reducer spacers and a good rear shock tune, it can be run relatively soft to absorb bumps and improve grip. There’s also enough support to feel playful and lively when pushed into compressions or popped off the ground.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VRX electric enduro mountain bike ridden by BikeRadar's Senior Technical EditorAlex Evans on Angry Sheep in Innerleithen, Scotland\" title=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VRX 9\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A steep seat tube angle and smooth suspension make climbing efficient and comfortable.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>That’s helpful on big landings to flat, too, where the rear end’s ramp-up is well matched to the forks, both getting to the end of their travel softly, rather than clanging into the bump stops.</p>\n<p>On the ups, the steep seat tube angle makes for comfortable and efficient pedalling, and the smooth, supple rear suspension gobbles up trail chatter proficiently.</p>\n<p>The E-Mythique LT’s Bafang motor is quieter than both Shimano’s EP8 and Bosch’s Performance Line CX. At lower speeds, output modes or cadences, it’s virtually silent.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VRX electric enduro mountain bike ridden by BikeRadar's Senior Technical EditorAlex Evans on Angry Sheep in Innerleithen, Scotland\" title=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VRX 10\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Relaxed geometry feels great when the trails get gnarly.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Power output is impressive and smooth in all modes, even Race; it doesn’t try to rip your arms off when you jump on the pedals.</p>\n<p>Overrun is long, extending motor power on the climbs. Going downhill, it’s better to use the lower assistance modes to avoid fighting the motor’s output with your brakes. Bosch’s Performance Line CX, also in its Race mode, suffers from the same issue.</p>\n<p>Although it’s early days, using Boost and Race modes almost exclusively, I managed to comfortably ride 25.53km and climb 1,070m, finishing the ride with 18 per cent charge remaining.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for a full review soon.</p>\n<h2>2023 Vitus E-Mythique LT prices, models and specifications</h2>\n<p>Each of the bikes in the three-bike E-Mythique LT line-up gets the same motor, battery and basic hardware. Elsewhere, however, the specs differ.</p>\n<p>Starting at £3,299.99/$3,699/€3,799.99, the VR model is equipped with a 160mm-travel SR Suntour Zeron36 fork and RockShox Deluxe Select R rear shock, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/microshift-advent-x-drivetrain-review/\">Microshift’s impressive Advent X drivetrain</a> and Tektro four-piston brakes.</p>\n<p>The VRS’ asking price lifts to £3,899.99/$4,199/€4,499.99. The bike is fitted with a 170mm-travel SR Suntour Durolux36 fork and RockShox Deluxe Select + rear shock. A mix of SRAM’s SX and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-nx-eagle-review/\">NX Eagle</a> drivetrains takes care of drive, while TRP’s Slate EVO brakes slow it down.</p>\n<p>Topping out the range is the VRX, which costs £4,399.99/$4,599/€5,099.99. Up front is a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/rockshox-yari-rc-review/\">RockShox Yari RC</a>, paired with a piggyback RockShox Select R shock. Once again, SRAM supplies the drivetrain, this time with an NX/GX Eagle mix. Finally, SRAM’s DB8 brakes are fitted.</p>\n<p>Vee Tire Co’s Attack HPL Top40 front and E-Control rear compound tyres feature on all three models, designed to offering a grippy, high-performance alternative to Maxxis rubber.</p>\n<h3>2023 Vitus E-Mythique LT VR</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VR electric mountain bike\" title=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VR electric mountain bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The E-Mythique LT VR retails for £3,299.99/$3,699/€3,799.99.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Vitus</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Frame:</strong> E-Mythique LT 6061 T6 double-butted alloy</li>\n<li><strong>Fork:</strong> SR Suntour Zeron36, 160mm travel</li>\n<li><strong>Shock:</strong> RockShox Deluxe Select R</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Tektro HD-M535</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> WTB ST Light i30 TCS on Vitus KT hubs</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Vee Tire Co Attack HPL Top40 front and E-Control rear compound</li>\n<li><strong>Bar, stem and grips:</strong> Nukeproof Neutron V2 Riser, Vitus Alloy, Vitus lock-on</li>\n<li><strong>Saddle and seatpost:</strong> Nukeproof Neutron, Brand-X Ascend Dropper</li>\n<li><strong>Motor, battery and display:</strong> Bafang M510, 630Wh Bafang M510, Bafang M510</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £3,299.99/$3,699/€3,799.99</li>\n</ul><h3>2023 Vitus E-Mythique LT VRS</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VRS electric mountain bike\" title=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VRS electric mountain bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The VRS model has SR Suntour’s Durolux36 forks.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Vitus</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Frame:</strong> E-Mythique LT 6061 T6 double-butted alloy</li>\n<li><strong>Fork:</strong> SR Suntour Durolux36, 170mm travel</li>\n<li><strong>Shock:</strong> RockShox Deluxe Select+</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> TRP Slate Evo</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> WTB ST Light i30 TCS on Vitus KT hubs</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Vee Tire Co Attack HPL Top40 front and E-Control rear compound</li>\n<li><strong>Bar, stem and grips:</strong> Nukeproof Neutron V2 Riser, Nukeproof Neutron, Vitus lock-on</li>\n<li><strong>Saddle and seatpost:</strong> Nukeproof Neutron, Brand-X Ascend Dropper</li>\n<li><strong>Motor, battery and display:</strong> Bafang M510, 630Wh Bafang M510, Bafang M510</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £3,899.99/$4,199/€4,499.99</li>\n</ul><h3>2023 Vitus E-Mythique LT VRX</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VRX electric mountain bike\" title=\"Vitus E-Mythique LT VRX electric mountain bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The range-topper is adorned with SRAM kit.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Vitus</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Frame:</strong> E-Mythique LT 6061 T6 double-butted alloy</li>\n<li><strong>Fork:</strong> RockShox Yari RC, 170mm travel</li>\n<li><strong>Shock:</strong> RockShox Super Deluxe Select R</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> SRAM DB8</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> WTB KOM Trail i30 on Vitus KT hubs</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Vee Tire Co Attack HPL Top40 front and E-Control rear compound</li>\n<li><strong>Bar, stem and grips:</strong> Nukeproof Neutron V2 Riser, Nukeproof Neutron, Vitus lock-on</li>\n<li><strong>Saddle and seatpost:</strong> Nukeproof Neutron, Brand-X Ascend Dropper</li>\n<li><strong>Motor, battery and display:</strong> Bafang M510, 630Wh Bafang M510, Bafang M510</li>\n<li>Price: £4,399.99/$4,599/€5,099.99</li>\n</ul>","author":"Alex Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"e9101d0a96b882b57ea2163aec1a830a0b22e72d3689355cecf3b771dcf961fd","category":"Cycling"}
