{"title":"The iPhone 16e has an annoying Bluetooth issue–and a fix is on the way","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2637354/iphone-16e-has-problems-with-bluetooth-connections.html","date":1741955580000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s iPhone 16e has only been out for a week and there’s already a major issue that has early adopters looking for a fix. According to posts on the <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255996256?sortBy=rank\">Apple Discussion Forum </a>and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1j2m0mr/iphone_16e_bluetooth_problem/\">Reddit</a> with more than 60 comments and 100 “Me too” reactions, Apple’s new phone has a nagging audio issue: If you’re playing audio through any Bluetooth headphones, the sound stutters several times per song for a second or two before continuing to play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is now aware of the problem, reports a user on the Apple Discussion Forums, who installed a profile on his affected iPhone and documented the issue for Apple’s engineering team. While there are r<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2555406/apple-is-about-to-switch-to-its-own-wi-fi-and-bluetooth-chip.html\">eports that Apple is working on an in-house Bluetooth/Wi-Fi chip</a>, the iPhone 16e still uses the part supplied by Broadcom.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18.3.2 doesn’t help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple this week released an <a href=\"https://www.macwelt.de/article/2634210/ios-18-3-2-sicherheit-update.html\" target=\"_blank\">update to iOS 18.3.2</a>, but affected users who installed the update were confronted with the same problems. Some users also report that their local Apple support replaced the devices with a new phone, but the issue persisted, which indicates that it’s a software issue. Some users have reported the issue on other iPhone models, but it doesn’t appear to be as widespread as the iPhone 16e.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those affected seem to have identified a common factor: Apparently, the sound playback in the Bluetooth headphones starts to “stutter” when the iPhone 16e is also connected to another device via Bluetooth. In several cases, it was a fitness tracker, for another user, it was an Oura ring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apparently, the bug will be fixed in the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macwelt.de/article/2615494/ios-18-4-nach-langer-beta-verzogerung-fur-anfang-april-geplant.html\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 18.4</a>, several contributors in the forums report no connection problems with the beta version of iOS 18.4. </p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"06fb2740e36b4c685ce52928d9a87ca026aa1f9882340c82b7eccb4b568443aa","category":"Apple"}
