Alongside this change, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-29/apple-sets-sept-12-date-for-launch-of-iphone-15-new-watches\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman today reported</a> that Apple plans to announce updated AirPods with a USB-C charging case during its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/\">event on Tuesday, September 12</a> at Steve Jobs Theater.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/airpods-pro-2.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\n\"To match the new iPhones, Apple will introduce updated AirPods at the event that include a USB-C charging port,\" wrote Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe report does not provide any additional details about the updated AirPods, so it's unclear if it is referring to the standard AirPods and/or the AirPods Pro, but both models will need to be updated with USB-C charging cases eventually to match the iPhone 15 models. Gurman and other sources <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/03/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-case/\">previously claimed</a> that the AirPods Pro would be updated with a USB-C charging case later this year, while hidden code-level references to new AirPods and a new charging case were <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/21/ios-16-4-airpods-reference/\">uncovered in iOS 16.4</a> back in March.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's also unclear if the updated AirPods will have any new features or changes beyond a USB-C charging case. The third-generation AirPods launched in October 2021, while the second-generation AirPods Pro were released in September 2022.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are several other Apple products and accessories that will likely need to transition from Lightning to USB-C over time if they remain sold, such as the AirPods Max, MagSafe Battery Pack, Magic Mouse, Magic Keyboard, Magic Trackpad, various adapters, and more.
