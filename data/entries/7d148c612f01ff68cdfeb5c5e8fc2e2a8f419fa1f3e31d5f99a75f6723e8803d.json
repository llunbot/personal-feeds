Don’t blame me for that – it is all <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/remembering-tom-simpson-50-years-on\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Simpson</a>’s fault. I had planned six pages or so for the Bordeaux-Paris race but following Tom’s sensational win four extra pages had to be found, and it was the Tour which suffered. I am sure readers will understand.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/remembering-herman-vanspringel\">Remembering Herman Vanspringel, ‘Monsieur Bordeaux-Paris’</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 146: on sale now!</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/remembering-tom-simpson-50-years-on\">Remembering Tom Simpson 50 years on</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>The man who penned those words, Jock Wadley, had enjoyed a close-up view of Simpson’s winning ride. Wadley arrived in Bordeaux the day before the race and spent the afternoon and evening prior to the 2am start locating the race HQ – the Café de France – and talking to mechanics and soigneurs. By 11pm he was in the Peugeot team’s hotel, waiting for the riders to make their way to the dining room for their pre-race meal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly afterwards Simpson walked down the stairs. He had barely slept and had endured spells of dizziness during the day. Still, Simpson was unperturbed: ‘The last time I felt like that was just before the World Road Championship in 1960,’ he told Wadley. ‘I turned out to be in top form really that day [Simpson would actually abandon that race having been hit by a car], so perhaps this is no cause for alarm. Nerves, maybe.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a meal of vegetable soup, raw carrots, rare steak and rice, followed by yoghurt, Simpson went to his room, accompanied by Wadley, who watched him ‘packing his valise with things not wanted on the 350-mile voyage ahead’, and getting his kit ready as they engaged in small talk. Wadley heard him murmur words of gratitude to his absent wife, Helen, for packing him some spare laces despite having just given birth to their second daughter just days before. It all adds up to a remarkably intimate portrait of a rider preparing himself for one of the toughest tests on the cycling calendar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just 15 riders rolled out from Bordeaux in the early hours of 26th May 1963. The format of the race had changed over the 72 years since its inaugural edition. This version would see the riders cover the first 260km alone before picking up their pacing Derny motorcycles at Châtellerault, some 300km or so southwest of Paris. During an earlier conversation with a Peugeot staffer, Wadley had questioned the point of this initial un-paced element, where the riders tended to just stick together, commenting that it seemed ‘a mere formality’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Bordeaux to Châtellerault nothing?’ the staffer had reacted. ‘I think it is very important indeed… they will not all arrive in the same condition. Those who have been the best looked after, and who have best looked after themselves for eight hours or more, will be the best equipped for the final battle behind the pacemakers.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those early kilometres were spent riding through pre-dawn darkness, the riders wearing woollen hats against the cold. After five and a half hours of riding, with the sun having now risen, Simpson came back through the following cars, shedding clothing. Wadley took the chance to grab a word. ‘Nearly went to sleep three times in the first hour or two,’ Simpson said. ‘I’ll be glad when the race really starts.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The formidable Simpson</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>That ‘racing’ started soon after the riders had collected their motor-pacers. While the attacks flew, including the first main escape of the race by Simpson’s teammate Jean Forestier, who steadily built a lead of six minutes and would end up spending more than 140km at the head of the race, Simpson remained calm and stayed with the other main favourites, Peter Post and Jo De Roo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the race moved into its final quarter, and with the gap to the front approaching nine minutes, Simpson indicated to his pacer, Fernand Wambst, to increase his speed. Methodically Simpson began to ease towards the riders in front of him and an hour later, approaching the final 65km, he was one of five riders at the front of the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simpson had enjoyed a good, if ultimately frustrating, early part of the 1963 season. He had finished on the podium of Gent-Wevelgem, the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Brussels but was yet to record a win beyond a stage of the Tour de Var. He was determined to take his first major win of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was on the lower slopes of the hill at Dourdan, in the Chevreuse Valley, that Simpson made his definitive move. Knowing that this was the decisive point in the race he upped his pace, dropped his co-leaders and set about building a race-winning lead, narrowly avoiding disaster when his front wheel brushed the back of his pacer’s Derny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With just over 35km to go, riding past scores of spectators sat at picnic tables in the woods of the Chevreuse valley, Simpson’s advantage was two minutes. Louison Bobet, winner of the race in 1959 but now following in a car, drew alongside Wadley and shouted across the cars: ‘<em>Bravo Tom – il est formidable!</em>’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And formidable Simpson was. After 15 hours and 43 minutes he sprinted across the finish line in front of a packed Parc des Princes to take the win by more than five minutes over teammate Piet Rentmeester. While the race’s field was perhaps small and short on quality, Wadley wrote that such was his class Simpson would have won no matter who was riding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>French writer Pierre Chany was more circumspect, writing, ‘The Briton was too strong, his rivals too few in number and of average ability.’ Regardless, Simpson had a classic win on his 1963 palmarès, becoming the third Briton to win the race, following George Pilkington-Mills in 1891 and Arthur Linton in 1896.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, Simpson would point to his relationship with Wambst, who had been chosen specifically to stop Simpson from attacking too early, as being key to his win, revealing they had barely needed to speak during the race such was their understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That night Wadley sat at a table with three Belgian journalists. On the table were bottles of champagne. ‘Tom comes from your country,’ one of the journalists said to Wadley, ‘but he lives in my town, Gent. Let us drink to your great compatriot, who I am proud to have as a neighbour.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 146 of <em>Cyclist </em>magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tom-simpson-bordeaux-paris-1963\">Pro race history: Tom Simpson wins Bordeaux-Paris in 1963</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"7d148c612f01ff68cdfeb5c5e8fc2e2a8f419fa1f3e31d5f99a75f6723e8803d","category":"Cycling"}
