This also helps if you want to tackle rougher terrain such as canal paths and gravel tracks.</p>\n<p>Mounts for mudguards, racks and other accessories mean you can prepare your hybrid for any eventuality, whether you plan to carry lots of luggage or ride whatever the weather.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Racks, flat bars and a comfy, capable geometry define hybrid bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robert Smith</i></span></div>\n<p>Like a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes/\">road bike</a>, hybrids will allow you to get around quickly. However, they are typically fitted with durable components that are tough enough for commuting, city riding and the wear and tear of daily use.</p>\n<p>Like a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-how-to-choose-the-right-one-for-you/\">mountain bike</a>, hybrids will have more relaxed geometry and flat handlebars, putting you in a comfortable and upright position on the bike. This can be particularly helpful for riding in traffic, affording you a good overview of what is going on around you.</p>\n<p>While hybrids fitted with suspension forks (front) are available, we would generally shy away from them on cheaper models. The suspension tends to be low-end and adds significant weight, without major performance improvements.</p>\n<p>An increasing number of hybrids are now fitted with disc brakes, which provide consistent stopping power in all conditions.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Disc brakes offer powerful and consistent stopping power in all conditions.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James Huang / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Hybrids are capable machines with various concessions to practicality and comfort that make them fuss-free bikes to live with.</p>\n<p>If you’re a dab hand at mechanics or you’ve got an old bike lying around that you want to put to good use, our guide on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/how-to-transform-your-bike-into-a-super-commuter/\">how to transform your bike into a super commuter</a> might be for you.</p>\n<h3>What types of hybrid bikes are available?</h3>\n<p>Hybrids all sit on a sliding scale between road and mountain bike. Where a certain model sits on that scale will define how well it copes with uneven off-road terrain and how fast you can travel on tarmac in the city.</p>\n<p>If you will be riding on rougher terrain, then you will want to look for an option with larger tyres to provide additional cushioning. On higher-end models, you might even want to consider a suspension fork for that extra bit of comfort.</p>\n<p>Hybrids designed for city riding will usually be fitted with slick road tyres and components that are much closer to a road bike, allowing you to get around quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h3>Will my tyres puncture?</h3>\n<p>We hate to be the bearer of bad news, but no matter how puncture-resistant your tyres may claim to be, they will never be completely immune.</p>\n<p>That said, hybrid bikes will generally be fitted with sturdy tyres that are pretty puncture-resistant. They are designed to reliably get you from A to B, day-in-day-out. So the likelihood is that you won’t have to worry about punctures at all.</p>\n<p>If you do end up with a puncture, we have a complete guide on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-fix-a-puncture-video/\">how to fix a puncture</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-inflate-a-bicycle-tyre-everything-you-need-to-know-about-pumps-valves-pressure-and-more/\">how to pump up your bike tyre</a>. It’s really not that difficult, we promise!</p>\n<h3>What gears do my hybrid bikes have?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This is the kind of drivetrain you’re most likely to encounter on your bike</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oliver Woodman / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The vast majority of hybrid bikes use derailleur gears. A <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/a-complete-guide-to-rear-derailleurs/\">rear derailleur</a> shifts your chain across the cogs at the rear wheel (cassette) and a front derailleur shifts it across the chainrings on the cranks, providing you with a large gear range to choose from.</p>\n<p>However, such an external system is relatively exposed to the elements and potential damage.</p>\n<p>Internal gear hubs are an alternative. The rear hub contains an internal gearbox providing anything from three to 14 gears, depending on the model.</p>\n<p>Despite the expense, there are some definite advantages. The enclosed system is protected from dirt, mud and crud, so hub gears tend to require very little maintenance.</p>\n<p>Belt drives are sometimes used instead of a chain for gear hubs. Unlike a chain, which requires regular cleaning and lubrication in order to work at its best, a belt drive uses a toothed belt that doesn’t require much maintenance.</p>\n<p>Crucially, you can avoid the greasy marks on your clothing that are a hazard of the traditional chain.</p>\n<p>If you’re new to riding with gears, our guide on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/gear/article/how-to-change-gears-on-your-bike-53282/\">how to change gears on your bike</a> explains everything you need to know.</p>\n<h3>Will the saddle be comfortable?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Less padding, counterintuitively, makes for greater all-day comfort.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Hybrids are created with comfort in mind, so chances are you will get on with the saddle that is fitted on your hybrid. However, bear in mind that saddles are a very personal choice and one size definitely does not fit all.</p>\n<p>Contrary to what you might think, lots of padding isn’t necessarily the best thing.</p>\n<p>Ideally, when on the bike you should be supported by your sit bones. Excess padding can put pressure on your soft tissue, impeding blood supply and causing numbness – that’s particularly the case the longer you are riding.</p>\n<p>The best thing to do is ask for expert advice in your local bike shop. You’ll often be able to try out some different saddles on your bike too, you just need to ask.</p>\n<p>You can also find out more in our guide on <a href=\"/advice/buyers-guides/how-to-choose-a-bike-saddle/\">how to choose a bike saddle</a> and see some of the best in our lists on the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-saddles/\">best bike saddles</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-womens-road-bike-saddles/\">best women’s bike saddles</a>.</p>\n<h3>Should my hybrid be steel, aluminium or carbon?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bikes like the Canyon Commuter 7 pair an aluminium frame with a carbon fork.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The vast majority of hybrid bike frames will be constructed from aluminium. This is an excellent choice, combining a competitive weight with relatively low cost.</p>\n<p>Aluminium frames can be made to ride very well at a fraction of the cost of higher-end options and are often paired with a carbon fork for improving vibration absorption at the front.</p>\n<p>The most expensive hybrids may come with a carbon frame, which can add further refinements to the ride with increased comfort at a lighter weight.</p>\n<p>However, carbon fibre is expensive and does have to be treated with care. Unless you’re sure that you can lock up your bike in a safe and secure location, we’d generally recommend against carbon for an everyday bike that will be used and abused.</p>\n<p>Steel frames are not widespread. While the material has many advantages, being incredibly durable (and some might say aesthetically pleasing), it is also comparatively heavy.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"/features/quick-guide-to-bike-frame-materials/\">quick guide to frame materials</a> explains more.</p>\n<h3>Accessories for hybrid bikes</h3>\n<p>The versatility of hybrids extends to the number of accessories that are either designed specifically to go with them or that can be added.</p>\n<h4>Mudguards</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Mudguards might not be particularly cool, but neither is being sprayed with muck.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A large percentage of hybrid bikes come pre-fitted with mudguards, particularly those aimed at commuters or urban cyclists who are likely to be using them in all weather conditions, including on wet roads.</p>\n<p>If mudguards don’t come as standard, any good hybrid will feature mounting points on the frame that allow you to fit them. Check out our list of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/gear/article/best-mudguards-buyers-guide-48430/\">best mudguards</a> to make your bike weather-proof and keep you dry.</p>\n<h4>Bike rack</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Carrying bags on a rack is more comfortable than using a backpack.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>There should also be eyelets for fitting racks, allowing you to carry your luggage in panniers rather than using a heavy backpack. Should you prefer to keep things on your back, however, there are many quality <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-backpack/\">commuter-specific backpacks</a> to choose from.</p>\n<h4>Bike lights</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Lights are essential for keeping you visible and safe.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-lights-for-road-cycling/\">best bike lights for road cycling</a> are a must for anyone riding after dark. We’d even recommend having lights throughout the day too for extra visibility.</p>\n<p>Some hybrid bikes will arrive with lights already fitted. These are normally powered by a dynamo, which draws power from rider input rather than batteries.</p>\n<h4>Bike computer</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bike computers will help you measure your ride, and some will work like a GPS computer in a car.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Bike computers are also handy.
