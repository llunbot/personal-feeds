{"title":"HoverAir X1 Pro vs The Gauntlet: Sports Tracking Test!","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/03/hoverair-x1-pro-gauntlet-tracking.html","date":1741089060000,"content":"<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p>The HoverAir X1 Pro/Pro-Max drones have been some of the most hotly anticipated drones over the last year. The pair was announced concurrently, and are near identical save a slightly better camera in the Pro-Max (capable of 8K). However, the standout feature of Hover’s drones has been its tracking features, combined with a unit that can take the reality-inducing pounding that comes with failed tracking attempts (hitting trees/poles/etc…).</p>\n<p>While it might sound counterintuitive, drones these days have transitioned a little bit away from perfecting obstacle avoidance, and instead, perfecting the actual track following. Meaning, instead of trying to avoid every tiny branch along the way, simply focus on mirroring the *exact* path the person/cyclist/etc has gone. The logic being: If an adult can fit through that space, so can a tiny drone the size of a paperback book.</p>\n<p>It’s a strategy that HoverAir has doubled down on for cycling especially, with a newer cycle-specific mode. Or rather, two modes. One for ‘narrow’ spots, and one for ‘wide open’ areas. In the ‘Narrow’ mode, it basically follows your body precisely. Every twist and turn, ensuring *not* to cut sharp corners, but rather follow where your wheels went. Whereas in ‘open’ mode, it smooths out those corners, resulting in an overall smoother look, but requiring more space around the drone.</p>\n<p>Now, back in November, I took the HoverAir X1 Pro through the Gauntlet course. The same course that virtually every other sports-tracking drone has completed (or mostly, died on).  However, as is often the case, I never finished editing that. And that was before cycling mode. So last week, while back in Amsterdam, I took it out for another spin on The Gauntlet.</p>\n<p>In fact, I did two tests back to back: The HoverAir X1 Pro, and the DJI Flip. Same day, same conditions, same route. That video will be up next. And it’s…umm…crunchy.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, go forth and enjoy the above! And thanks for watching!</p>","author":"Ray Maker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"368440a75ccb001ebf21538e7b1cab6df0ce5dd6096a296f9747ae9b2338ac16","category":"Cycling"}
