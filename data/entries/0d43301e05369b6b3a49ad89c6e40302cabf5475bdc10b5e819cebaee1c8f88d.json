But it also drives a hole through the argument made by people in the solar industry who say there is no clear connection between solar and a drop in values.</p>\n<p>The authors analyzed 1.8 million home sales near solar farms in six states and found diminished property values in Minnesota (4 percent), North Carolina (5.8 percent) and New Jersey (5.6 percent). The three other states—California, Connecticut and Massachusetts—had price changes that were within their margins of error, which means the price effects were too close to zero to be meaningful. The paper was published in the journal Energy Policy.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924182#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924182&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Inside Climate News","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0d43301e05369b6b3a49ad89c6e40302cabf5475bdc10b5e819cebaee1c8f88d","category":"Tech"}
