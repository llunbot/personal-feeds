The carrots include Windows 11's new features (both AI and otherwise), and the performance, security, and battery life benefits inherent to brand-new PC hardware. The stick is that Windows 10 support ends in October of 2025, and Microsoft is not interested in extending that date for the general public or in expanding official Windows 11 support to older PCs.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/as-it-buries-windows-10-microsoft-declares-2025-year-of-the-windows-11-pc-refresh/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/as-it-buries-windows-10-microsoft-declares-2025-year-of-the-windows-11-pc-refresh/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"af1186a08209802a0fc84f1dbaf706b54399b60a82daa289b0494cba675ff89f","category":"Tech"}
