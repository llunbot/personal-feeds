Today, the company announced <a href=\"https://atari.com/products/atari-2600-plus\">the Atari 2600+</a>, a $130 retro console with a cartridge slot that can accept vintage and modern Atari 2600 and 7800 cartridges, plus a $25 <a href=\"https://atari.com/products/cx40-joystick\">CX40+ joystick</a> and <a href=\"https://atari.com/products/cx30-paddle-controller-bundle\">$40 CX30+ paddle controller bundle</a> that appear to more-or-less faithfully re-create the originals.</p>\n<p>All items are currently available for pre-order and will ship in November 2023. The console includes a 10-in-1 game cartridge with <em>Adventure</em>, <em>Combat</em>, <em>Missile Command</em>, <em>Haunted House</em>, <em>Yars' Revenge</em>, and a few other 2600 games.</p>\n<p>The Atari 2600+ takes its design cues from the early-1980s revision of the original console, with fake wood grain on the front and four control switches. But Atari says the console is only 80 percent as large as the original console, \"making it easier to fit into modern living spaces.\" The console also has an HDMI output and uses USB-C for power.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962282#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962282&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7d3174ea2857e55310c507e826cf90b294ab67a37c7990bd68b6c1dd4dc632d2","category":"Tech"}
