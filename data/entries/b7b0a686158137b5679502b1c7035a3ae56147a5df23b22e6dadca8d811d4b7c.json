{"title":"John Siracusa: ‘Apple Turnover’","link":"https://hypercritical.co/2025/05/09/apple-turnover","date":1747697873000,"content":"\n<p>John Siracusa, in a piece that, in a bit of rhetorical deftness, only mentions Tim Cook by name once:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What <em>should</em> be motivating Apple to make improvements — the\ndesire to make great products — seems absent. What should <em>not</em>\nbe motivating Apple — the desire for power, control, and profits — seems omnipresent.</p>\n\n<p>And I don’t mean that in a small way; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KdlJlHAAbQ\">I mean that in a big\nway</a>. Every new thing we learn about <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/apple/659296/apple-failed-compliance-court-ruling-breakdown\">Apple’s internal\ndeliberations</a> surrounding these decisions only lends more\nweight to the conclusion that Apple has lost its north star.\nOr, rather, it has replaced it with a new, dark star. And time\nand again, we’ve learned that these decisions go all the way to\nthe top.</p>\n\n<p>The best leaders can change their minds in response to new\ninformation. The best leaders can <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/05/04/tony-fadell-talks-about-steve-jobs-controversial-decisions-on-ipod-and-iphone-development/\">be persuaded</a>. But we’ve had\ndecades of strife, lawsuits, and regulations, and Apple has\nstubbornly dug in its heels even further at every turn. It seems\nclear that there’s only one way to get a different result.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Covers a lot in a relatively short essay. I do not agree with Siracusa on his conclusion, but I’ve sat on linking to it, because — along with a few other recents posts and goings-on — it’s given me much to think about, and has helped me clarify my own thoughts, which I need to put in a piece of their own. But if you haven’t read Siracusa’s yet, you should.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/19/siracusa-apple-turnover\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b7b0a686158137b5679502b1c7035a3ae56147a5df23b22e6dadca8d811d4b7c","category":"Tech"}
