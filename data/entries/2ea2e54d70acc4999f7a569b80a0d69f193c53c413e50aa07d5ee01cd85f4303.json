However, it's now shared the deals you can expect to see on Black Friday, so you should have a clearer view on what you can expect when shopping this week.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Best Buy's Black Friday Schedule</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nLike other stores, Best Buy's event is more of a week of sales rather than just one day. The retailer kicked things off on Sunday, November 21, and deals will come in and out all the way through Black Friday.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li>Sunday, November 21 - Online sales begin</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Wednesday, November 24 - MacBook Air deals begin</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Thursday, November 25 - Stores closed, online sales continue</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Friday, November 26 - Specific opening hours vary by location</li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Best Buy Black Friday - Deals Live Now</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nBest Buy's <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/153062/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fblack-friday%2Fsale-ad\">early Black Friday sale</a> is focused on a <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/153062/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpromo%2Fshop-tv\">variety of TV sets</a>, including those from brands like Sony, Insignia, Samsung, Toshiba, LG, and more. There are also a few deals on sound bars to pair with a new TV setup, like <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/153062/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-hw-q65t-7-1ch-sound-bar-with-dolby-atmos-black%2F6454639.p%3FskuId%3D6454639\">Samsung's HW-Q65T 7.1ch Sound Bar with Dolby Atmos</a> for $279.99 ($220 off).\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/153062/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Finsignia-58-class-f30-series-led-4k-uhd-smart-fire-tv%2F6463115.p%3FskuId%3D6463115\">Insignia 58-inch LED 4K UHD Smart TV</a> - $349.99, down from $579.99</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/153062/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-50-class-7-series-led-4k-uhd-smart-tizen-tv%2F6401738.p%3FskuId%3D6401738\">Samsung 50-inch LED 4K Smart TV</a> - $459.99, down from $479.99</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/153062/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-70-class-tu6985-4k-crystal-uhd-smart-tizen-tv%2F6476246.p%3FskuId%3D6476246\">Samsung 70-inch 4K Crystal UHD Smart TV</a> - $599.99, down from $749.99</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/153062/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-65-class-8000-series-led-4k-uhd-smart-tizen-tv%2F6453024.p%3FskuId%3D6453024\">Samsung 65-inch 8000 Series LED 4K UHD Smart TV</a> - $699.99, down from $799.99</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/153062/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-75-class-7-series-led-4k-uhd-smart-tizen-tv%2F6401719.p%3FskuId%3D6401719\">Samsung 75-inch 4K UHD Smart TV</a> - $849.99, down from $1,099.99</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/153062/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsony-55-class-bravia-xr-a80j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv%2F6455217.p%3FskuId%3D6455217\">Sony 55-inch OLED 4K UHD Smart TV</a> - $1,399.99, down from $1,799.99</li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBest Buy is already offering <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/153062/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpromo%2Fnew-video-games\">solid deals on video games</a> as well, many of which are reaching prices that we're expecting to see on Black Friday.

For example, the retailer has the AirPods Pro for $189.99 ($60 off) right now, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/10/black-friday-spotlight-walmart-2/\">Walmart is set to have these for $159.00</a> later today, a record low price.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf you shop more at Best Buy than Target, you can <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/153062/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-gift-card-holiday-limited-edition-app-store-apple-music-itunes-iphone-ipad-airpods-accessories-and-more-digital%2F6480951.p%3FskuId%3D6480951\">get a $15 Best Buy gift card when purchasing a $100 Apple Gift Card</a>.

We've seen these models get discounted by as much as $200, so while Best Buy may be offering solid markdowns we may see steeper discounts during the week.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Best Buy Black Friday - Deals Starting 11/25</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nSimilar to Wednesday, on Thanksgiving day shoppers can expect one major deal added to Best Buy's week-long event. The retailer will be taking <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/153062/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpromo%2Fbeats-studio-buds\">$50 off the Beats Studio Buds</a>, dropping the new earphones to just $99.99.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe're keeping track of all this season's best deals in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/black-friday/\"><strong>Black Friday 2021 Roundup</strong></a>.
