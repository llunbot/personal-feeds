There’s 500mg sodium and 200mg potassium, plus a couple milligrams of calcium. It’s available in <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=66154X1653891&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=brgcfoodhoneystinger&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhoneystinger.com%2Fproducts%2Fblack-cherry-sport-hydration-mix\" target=\"_blank\">Black Cherry</a> and <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=66154X1653891&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=brgcfoodhoneystinger&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhoneystinger.com%2Fcollections%2Fsport-hydration-mixes%2Fproducts%2Fmango-melon-sport-hydration-mix\" target=\"_blank\">Mango Melon</a>, the latter of which adds 75mg caffeine, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oddly, they only come in tiny 8-serving pouches, MSRP is $9.99.
