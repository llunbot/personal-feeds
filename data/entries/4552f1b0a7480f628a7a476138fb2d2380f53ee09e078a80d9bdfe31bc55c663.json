It has the official designation 21N311.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>visionOS 1.0.1 (21N311) has been released. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/gW9ZKQ43DV&amp;xcust=1-1-2216717-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/gW9ZKQ43DV</a></p>— iSoftware Updates (@iSWUpdates) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/iSWUpdates/status/1749981802490400955?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2216717-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">January 24, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>visionOS is an entirely new operating system–Apple describes it as the company’s “first spatial operating system”–created for Vision Pro. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1964519/visionos-developer-beta-environments-features-release.html\">first beta</a> came out last June, and Apple’s software engineers have clearly done a great deal of development work since then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might seem odd for a hardware product to get a software update before it even launches, but this is more common than you might think. Weary gamers frequently have to install updates on brand-new consoles before they can think about playing actual games, and even fresh-from-the-box iPhones and iPads are quite likely to have new versions of iOS or iPadOS available for download when you power them up. There is inevitably a gap between products being put in their boxes and handed over to customers, and if a significant security flaw is spotted in that time, or the development team completes work on an important new feature, then it makes sense to address that in a day-one update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t know what this particular update includes, since Apple hasn’t released any notes. But the version number structure (X.X.X rather than X.X) suggests it isn’t anything huge; probably just some minor bug fixes. The first major update is likely to be visionOS 2.0, which is expected to be announced at WWDC 2024.</p>\n\nVirtual Reality</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4552f1b0a7480f628a7a476138fb2d2380f53ee09e078a80d9bdfe31bc55c663","category":"Apple"}
