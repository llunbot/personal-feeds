Sellers just need to open up the app, register the sale, and present their ‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌ to the buyer, who can then use an appropriate contactless payment method.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTap to Pay on ‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌ is available to over 700,000 additional businesses across the United States, and Apple Stores in the U.S. have also rolled out the feature. Brazil is the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/tap-to-pay/#regions\">sixth region</a> to support Tap to Pay, following similar rollouts in the U.K., Australia, Taiwan, and the Netherlands earlier in the year.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/brazil/\">Brazil</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tap-to-pay-on-iphone/\">Tap to Pay on iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apple-launches-tap-to-pay-on-iphone-brazil/\">Apple Launches Tap to Pay on iPhone in Brazil</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-tap-to-pay-on-iphone-in-brazil.2403605/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f27a48b8d5c175c6e273848ac7cd52c5a6428f1757ff32a13b6e6e265cb27148","category":"Apple"}
