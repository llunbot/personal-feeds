I get a stack of bills every month. I get collection notices every day,' explained Gaimon to CBS.</p>\n<p>Initially, Gaimon's insurance covered $52,000 of the work however the costs continued to rise as he realised he had been hit by what one expert described as the '<span>three big landmines' of hospital billing in the United States despite believing that he was fully insured.</span> </p>\n<p>'Hospital billing is filled with landmines,' expert Dr. Elizabeth Rosenthal, editor-in-chief of Kaiser Health News, told CBS. 'And Phil hit three of them – out-of-network hospitals, high costs, and here's the biggy in his case – insurance from one state often doesn't work very well in another.'</p>\n<p>Retrospectively, Gaimon discovered that the Lehigh Valley Hospital had marked his shoulder surgery down as 'elective' rather than 'emergency', hiking his costs, and that it was also in the state of Pennsylvania which has different billing laws to California where his insurer is based.</p>\n<p>Gaimon, who is still attempting to persuade primary insurer Health Net to cover more of his bills, called the system 'a gamble'.</p>\n<p>'This could happen to anybody at any time – where you can just wake up in a hospital and then later find out you owe them $150,000. I wish I knew that getting health insurance was still, essentially, a gamble.' </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"7e320306ff8a3e10c23d5a2bb69e579ac875ec7ce9871d71aa67a8acc056cd72","category":"Cycling"}
