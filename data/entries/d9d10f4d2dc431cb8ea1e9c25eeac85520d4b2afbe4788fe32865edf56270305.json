The practice was a hangover from the Cold War, a time when irritable superpowers menaced one another with complete annihilation. How times change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a tortured analogy in here somewhere about a road’s hidden dangers, or perhaps something about blowing up when it all gets to be too much on a tough climb, but like every major tourist route in Switzerland, the Susten Pass is beguilingly perfect and largely free of jeopardy – legions of cars and motorbikes notwithstanding.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/grosse-scheidegg\">Classic climb: Grosse Scheidegg, the Swiss climb with the traffic-free cherry on top</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/classic-climbs-furka-pass\">Classic climb: Furka Pass, the Swiss climb with the Midas touch</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 143: on sale now!</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Supposedly the TNT has now been removed, but in any case, the Swiss are the one nationality I’d trust to leave bombs everywhere safely. No matter how extreme the scenery, riding here always gives you the feeling you’re in good hands. You are going to do battle with the supersized landscape, not the infrastructure, which is unrelentingly perfect at all times.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The western front</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Susten Pass\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>There’s 15km or so of green valley before the views open up, and you can really enjoy them – the average gradient over 28km is 5.7% and the maximum only just tips into double figures.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The heir to a 17th century mule track, the modern day Susten Pass road was built from 1938 to 1945, and inaugurated in 1946. It links the towns of Innertkirchen in the Bernese Oberland on the western side to Wassen in the canton of Uri on the eastern side. This is the western approach, which tops out at 2,224m above sea level.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Susten Pass\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Susten isn’t really an essential transport link for anyone because there are more practical routes if you really need to get somewhere. Most of the traffic here is from tourism, so it’s one of the last passes to open for the high season as the snow recedes. It’s usually ridable from some point in June, closing in October or even early November.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Consistent excellence</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Susten does and does not offer variety. Visually it’s uniformly pleasing, but it takes time to really get going before it transitions from merely pretty to truly, breathtakingly stunning. Roughly the whole of the first half is an unthreatening Alpine meander, a succession of cute but orderly villages dotted along a valley, with picturesque meadows and densely forested hillsides for company.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-04-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Susten Pass\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-04-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-04-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-04-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The second half of the ascent is packed with hairpins. This is the Gschletterkurve at the 16km mark.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Switzerland does rustic particularly well, but it’s never shabby. The odd bit of weathered wood on a chalet is more like the patina on a piece of antique furniture than actual evidence of decay. One has the sense this is a country that lives comfortably in amongst its heritage rather than treating it as something to be preserved in glass cases. This is no theme park, it’s just a place that has chosen not to change because the way things are done here is precisely tailored to the landscape and the seasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is evident when you examine early photos of the road itself. Hardly a bollard has moved in over 70 years and the aesthetics haven’t been cheapened with plastic road furniture, or Armco for that matter. Many of the drops further up the climb remain impressively perilous, and there are no second chances when it comes to riding back down.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Susten Pass\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Think hard about your choice of line if you come back down this way – there’s no Armco to save you here.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>While no part of the pass is ultra-steep, some of the more challenging sections arrive early on, but even these just barely flirt with double-digit percentages. It’s fair to say things get more interesting in the second half of the climb. The views open up considerably and the road embarks on a furious series of wiggles that affords an endless variety of thrilling backdrops, and plenty of opportunities to get out of the saddle as you power round a hairpin. What is it that’s so addictive about a 180° bend in a road? It’s probably the brief illusion of rapid progress after a long, steady grind, and there’s a whole lot of that on the Susten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also short tunnels at intervals along the pass, which on a bright day will plunge you into the inkiest of blackness. It’s well worth having a good rear light for these because motorists can be caught unawares by the sudden transitions.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Susten Pass\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-06-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-06-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/susten-pass-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The penultimate hairpin delivers you an open, sprawling vista.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The tunnels are a signature of the Susten, located where it was deemed easier to punch through immense rocky outcrops than trying to skirt around them. A waterfall cascades lazily over one of the more striking of these, brave rock climbers dangling in its spray.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upper part of the climb looks out towards the Stein glacier, a magnificent duvet of ice draped over the mountain. Its retreat has created a sizable lake that, while beautiful, is an ominous sign of the times.

Countless car and motorcycle publications laud it as one of the best Alpine passes for driving and riding thrills. Combined with the limited opening, it can be busy when the weather is good. Don’t let this put you off, however, because the views are second to none and, with well-sighted corners and immaculate surfaces, negotiating the traffic is rarely stressful. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disliking things because they’re popular is self-defeating, and the Susten deserves its place in the Alpine pass hall of fame. It’s also very unlikely to explode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 142 of Cyclist magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/susten-pass-cycling\">Susten Pass: The supersized Swiss climb</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"d9d10f4d2dc431cb8ea1e9c25eeac85520d4b2afbe4788fe32865edf56270305","category":"Cycling"}
