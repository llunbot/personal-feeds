While the blue anodized frames might be more iconic than the polished frames, there’s something alluring about those ground-down welds and shiny finish. Yet, this 1994 Cannondale Track has a bit more going on than a pristine appearance…</em><span></span></p>\n<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-1.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-1.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-1.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-1.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>From a Shed to the Boards</h3>\n<p>We’ve talked before about how we are just the current stewards of our bikes and hopefully, they will outlive us. I’ve got a friend named Morgan. He’s been a behind-the-scenes figure in the bike industry, working in marketing for SRAM, editorially for Bike Mag, and in other tangental jobs over the years.</p>\n<p>He, like a lot of us that put pen to paper or click shutter buttons at The Radavist, is a fan of all sorts of bicycle taxonomies. For instance, just because I like to ride a lot of dirt doesn’t mean I don’t pine for the clean, classic lines of a <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/riding-as-ceremony-a-vintage-road-bike-is-all-you-need/\" target=\"_blank\">1980s road bike</a> or the steep angles and aggressive geometry of a 1990s track bike.</p>\n<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-15.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-15.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-15.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-15.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-15.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/morga_deth/\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan</a> is a cataloger of moments. His storage shed was a treasure trove of unique blips throughout the industry from the 90s through the aughts. Rare parts, film negatives, posters, ephemera of all sorts.</p>\n<p>When he transitioned out of the bike industry (hopefully not for good; I miss working with you, friend!) he went through a reckoning in which he sold many of the higher-dollar items that had accrued a substantial value for our legal tender.</p>\n<p>One of which is this very 1994 Cannondale Track frame.</p>\n<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/LA-Invitational-163.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/LA-Invitational-163.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/LA-Invitational-163.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/LA-Invitational-163.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/LA-Invitational-163.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Peer to Peer</h3>\n<p>If you recall from our <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2022-la-invitational-cub-house/\" target=\"_blank\">2022 LA Invitational Reportage</a>, Josh and I documented the happenings at The Cub House swap. Hanging from the EZ UP tents and spread across pop-up tables were all eras of cycling memorabilia, components, and frames. Morgan had hoped to round up some loose petty cash by letting some of his bounties go, including his beloved 1994 Track.</p>\n<p>Had he ridden track bikes in any capacity in recent years? No. But that doesn’t mean it’s easy to let go. In a surprising turn of events, he sold almost all of his goods, save for the track bike, which remained at the end of the day.</p>\n<p>Sean T, co-owner of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/itsnotabikeshop/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">The Cub House</a> and <a href=\"http://teamdreamteam.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Team Dream Team</a> in San Marino, California, saw the frame and bought it from Morgan, where it hung up in the shop for a few years.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-3.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-3.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-3.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-3.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Build Kit</h3>\n<p>A few of The Cub House’s friends and employees began racing at the track again. Eventually, Sean felt the calling and built the bike up with some choice componentry. A friend who worked for Mavic USA sent over some rare and unique Mavic Special Service Course wheels that never made it to the public market.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-8.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-8.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-8.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-8.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1334\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-6.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-6.jpg?w=1334&amp;quality=75 1334w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-6.jpg?resize=1200,1799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-6.jpg?resize=768,1151&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-6.jpg?resize=1025,1536&amp;quality=75 1025w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-33.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-33.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-33.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-33.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-33.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Then, Sean found some Suntour Superbe Pro track cranks with a 48t ring and 14t cog, headset, bottom bracket, Salsa stem, Nitto track bars, an American Classic seatpost, and yeah, a NOS Ti-railed Flite saddle. The build is stunning, with the polished frame accentuated by black and gold components. I always loved the Track’s steel fork to offset the stiff-riding frame. Sean rides it in Carson at The Velo Sports Center.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-2.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-2.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-2.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-2.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Adieu</h3>\n<p>Morgan laments selling the frame but is glad it went to a friend and is finally being ridden after years of storage, yet he did tell me “I’m buying it back when I’m rich again…”</p>\n<p><em>See this bike on display at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/itsnotabikeshop/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">The Cub House</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/1994-cannondale-track-bike/\">Peer to Peer: 1994 Cannondale Track Bike</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"53817daaae902b51b01ea367d5c18b3d9bcc08fad4fa5536a58ba2ff41a2c222","category":"Cycling"}
