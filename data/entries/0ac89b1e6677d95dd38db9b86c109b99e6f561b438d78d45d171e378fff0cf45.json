And no wonder – it gave fans a chance to see some of the biggest names in cycling competing on the track inside a velodrome over six consecutive nights, while enjoying an atmosphere that felt more like a concert or festival than a sporting event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Events such as the Six Days of Ghent continue that heritage to this day, packing thousands of fans into the arena each year for a unique spectacle of sight, sound and entertainment that no other sporting event can match. And that’s exactly the kind of atmosphere you can expect at the London 3 Day in October – full-throttle, high-speed racing and a fun atmosphere.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"611\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/london-3-day-velodrome-970x611.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/london-3-day-velodrome-970x611.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/london-3-day-velodrome-300x189.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/london-3-day-velodrome-768x483.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/london-3-day-velodrome-750x472.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/london-3-day-velodrome.jpg 1039w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>London 3 Day: The races</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At its heart, the London 3 Day is a serious sporting event, and you can be sure there will be plenty of thrilling on-track action to enjoy over the three days. First up is the madison, a relay race where riders compete in pairs, with the aim of completing the most number of laps in a set time. Only one rider is active at a time, with the switchover involving a hand sling at speed on the track, a feat of co-ordination that always makes for exciting action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there’s the elimination race, a steady ramping up of the stakes that sees the last-placed rider eliminated from the race every couple of laps until just two riders remain to battle it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The points race switches the focus back to the front of the field, with the objective being to accumulate points in regular sprints as the race progresses, with the winner being the rider with the highest total at the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the derny race, riders are paced in the slipstream of a rider on a special motorbike, with the pair working together in finely tuned co-ordination to build up speed, before the derny peels off to leave the riders to fight it out for victory over a frantic final few laps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of it all, an inaugural London 3 Day Champion will be crowned based on points built up across each sprint and each race in a fitting finale to three thrilling days of racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the fans get a chance to compete for glory at the London 3 Day. In a unique one-off challenge, one lucky member of the public will get to take on ‘The Lightning’ over a two-lap race with half a lap head start. If they get to the finish line first, they’ll win a cool £5,000. <a href=\"https://www.london3day.com\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to find out more about how the challenge works.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"727\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/london-3-day-katie-archibald-727x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/london-3-day-katie-archibald-727x970.jpg 727w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/london-3-day-katie-archibald-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/london-3-day-katie-archibald-768x1025.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/london-3-day-katie-archibald-1151x1536.jpg 1151w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/london-3-day-katie-archibald-750x1001.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/london-3-day-katie-archibald-1140x1522.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/london-3-day-katie-archibald.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>London 3 Day: The riders</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As befitting an event taking place at a symbol of cycling excellence such as the Lee Valley VeloPark, the field for the London 3 Day is a real who’s who of UK and international cycling talent.
