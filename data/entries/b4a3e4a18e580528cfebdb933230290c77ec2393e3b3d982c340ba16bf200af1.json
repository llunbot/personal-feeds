The labs will provide testing and optimization for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a> apps, with Apple experts on hand.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAny developer can apply to attend a developer lab, but Apple is not reimbursing for travel, and developers located on the east coast of the United States will have to fund cross-country travel to get to the lab. Apple's choice to host only one U.S. lab location is curious as the company has said that the Vision Pro will be launching first in the United States before becoming available in other countries.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌visionOS‌ simulator has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/21/apple-releases-first-ever-visionos-beta/\">not been available for long</a>, so many developers may still have apps in development and might not be ready to attend a lab. Other developers may not be motivated to create apps when the Vision Pro isn't slated to launch in their countries for some time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is also planning to send <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/24/apple-vision-pro-developer-kits-now-available/\">Vision Pro developer kits</a> to some developers, and applications opened two weeks ago. The developer kits are available in limited quantities, with Apple prioritizing apps that best take advantage of the Vision Pro features and capabilities. Apple has strict rules for the developer kits, such as limiting them to one development site and keeping them in a private, secure workspace, which may not be possible for some smaller developers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDevelopers will have more than six months to test and develop apps for the Vision Pro as it is not expected to launch until early 2024, a timeline that could range from January 2024 to April 2024, and that's provided there are no launch delays.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/apple-vision-pro-developer-lab-attendance/\">Apple's Vision Pro Developer Labs Not Drawing Many Attendees</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-vision-pro-developer-labs-not-drawing-many-attendees.2397580/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b4a3e4a18e580528cfebdb933230290c77ec2393e3b3d982c340ba16bf200af1","category":"Apple"}
