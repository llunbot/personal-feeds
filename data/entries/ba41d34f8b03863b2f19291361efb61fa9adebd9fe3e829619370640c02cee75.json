The custom tools support features on the new Apple Pencil Pro, including the squeeze gesture and barrel roll action.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 18 and visionOS 2 also support custom drawing tools in apps, but the iPhone and Vision Pro do not support the Apple Pencil. As always, any drawing tool can also be controlled with your finger and other input methods.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iPadOS-18-Custom-Drawing-Tool-Apple-Pencil-2.jpg\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" />\r<br />\nIn addition to custom tools, apps across iPadOS 18, iOS 18, and visionOS 2 are able to change the selection of default drawing tools that appear in the system tool picker. Apple said apps are even able to offer multiple tools of the same type for added convenience, such as two colors of pens or two colors of markers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPadOS 18, iOS 18, and visionOS 2 are currently in beta.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139\">iPad Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/ipados-18-custom-apple-pencil-drawing-tools/\">iPadOS 18 Allows Apps to Offer Custom Drawing Tools for Apple Pencil</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipados-18-allows-apps-to-offer-custom-drawing-tools-for-apple-pencil.2429675/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ba41d34f8b03863b2f19291361efb61fa9adebd9fe3e829619370640c02cee75","category":"Apple"}
