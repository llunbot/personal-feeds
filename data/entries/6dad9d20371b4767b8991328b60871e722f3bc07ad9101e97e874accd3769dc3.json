The start of the year still feels like just yesterday and yet here we are, launching full speed into Grand Tour season with the arrival of the Giro d’Italia. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\">The three-week race</a> will initially take riders through Albania before crossing into Italy after its opening weekend, with a brief foray onto <em>strade bianche</em>, dipping into Slovenia and returning to the Colle delle Finestre before finishing in Rome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-favourites\">fight for the <em>maglia rosa</em></a> is officially on, but here we focus on six other major storylines to follow alongside that.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>The young guns</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T135742.309-970x647.png\" alt=\"paul magnier soudal quickstep\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T135742.309-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T135742.309-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T135742.309-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T135742.309-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T135742.309-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T135742.309-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T135742.309-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T135742.309-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T135742.309-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T135742.309.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Oman Cycling Association/Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Gone are the days of younger riders easing their way into the elite ranks, sheltering under the wing of the elder statesmen like baby birds. Such is the strength of the younger generation that Juan Ayuso, a rider making his debut at the race for UAE Team Emirates XRG, is tipped for one of the top two places on the podium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paul Magnier of Soudal-QuickStep is the most youthful in the bunch and his presence brings much fanfare despite only being 21 years and 25 days old. His season so far has included a win at Étoile de Bessèges and a close second place at Omloop Nieuwsblad. He’ll be looking to take what could be the first of many Grand Tour stage wins with several sprint stages and a few slightly harder days that he could survive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two months older is Josh Tarling, who needs little introduction. The Brit became the joint youngest WorldTour stage winner alongside Remco Evenepoel with his time-trial win at the Renewi Tour as a 19-year-old in 2023. He also boasts medals across National, European and World Championships in the time-trial and as such is an exciting prospect for the two Giro stages against the clock. The first hits on Stage 2 in Albania over 13.7km and the second falls just after the second rest day on Stage 10, which is a bit longer at 28.6km. This will be Tarling’s second Grand Tour, but with the TT coming so soon he could very well find himself with a stint in the pink jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Picnic-PostNL’s Max Poole made a name for himself at the Vuelta. Then 21 (now 22), he rode to four top-three placings in the mountain stages. He arrives at the Giro having recently topped the youth standings at the Tour of the Alps. The team want to test him on general classification, but with XDS-Astana breathing down their necks in the UCI relegation standings, they must sweep up as many points as possible. A couple of stage wins will help.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+4\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'the world's best cycling magazine, delivered to your door, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>One last dance</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2153681110.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2153681110.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2153681110-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2153681110-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2153681110-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2153681110-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2153681110-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2153681110-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2153681110-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum sit those for whom this Giro will be their last. A handful on the start list will be <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/retirements-2025\">retiring this year </a>and hoping to make the most of their final three-week tour around Italy. The oldest in the peloton is Israel-Premier Tech duo Jakob Fuglsang and Simon Clarke. This will be Fuglsang’s third participation in the Giro, his best result a sixth place overall in 2020, while Clarke achieved a team time-trial stage win in 2015 with Orica-GreenEDGE. Both will be riding as support for Derek Gee as the Canadian tests himself on general classification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan Castroviejo, meanwhile, is participating in his last Giro for Ineos Grenadiers aged 38. A strong time-triallist, the Spaniard had a chokehold on the Spanish time-trial championships with six victories spanning a decade, and should ride to a strong placing on the two TT stages while also being reliable support for Egan Bernal and Thymen Arensman in the mountains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there’s Picnic-PostNL’s Romain Bardet, the romantic’s favourite. In his final Tour de France last year, the Frenchman was able to finally wear the <em>maillot jaune</em> for the first time after his impressive opening stage 1-2 with teammate Frank van den Broek. While understandably favouring that race throughout his career – Bardet has ridden 11 Tours and just three Giri – he still cracked the top ten by finishing seventh overall in 2021 and ninth in 2024. It’s probably a more stressful final outing than he would like given the team’s relegation battle, but as with teammate Poole, a stage win or two could turn this around. He came close last year, with a second on Bocca della Selva, and we can expect him to give it a go this time around.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n

Bernal became the second Colombian to win the Giro, and he did it in dominant fashion. As the ticker tape rained down on the champion upon his arrival in Milan, he probably couldn’t imagine he’d wait four years for his next victory on the road. Or what he would have to overcome to get there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bernal said the injuries sustained after a horror crash on a training ride the next year gave him a ‘95% chance’ of either becoming paralysed or dying. He lay in a hospital bed with fractured vertebrae, a fractured femur, chest trauma and a punctured lung. Getting on the bike the same year would feel an insurmountable task, yet he was back at the start line of a race only eight months later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bernal’s first victory since that Giro came at the 2025 Colombian National Championships where he won both the time-trial and the road race. And he looked in great form starting the European season, riding well at Clásica Jaén before he slipped out on a corner and broke his collarbone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not ideal preparation for this year’s Giro, but despite all that, he is back on the start line for the first time since his victory four years ago. That’s a win in itself considering all he had to persevere. But also being capable of a position to fight for the podium as well as having a teammate in Arensman capable of achieving a similarly strong position on GC himself? It’s one of the best positions Ineos Grenadiers have found themselves in at a Grand Tour for quite a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Picnic-PostNL vs XDS-Astana</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"617\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2209915047-scaled-e1746794948150-970x617.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2209915047-scaled-e1746794948150-970x617.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2209915047-scaled-e1746794948150-300x191.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2209915047-scaled-e1746794948150-768x489.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2209915047-scaled-e1746794948150-1536x978.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2209915047-scaled-e1746794948150-750x477.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2209915047-scaled-e1746794948150-1140x726.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2209915047-scaled-e1746794948150.webp 1937w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the final year in this <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-rankings-promotions-and-relegations\" target=\"_blank\">WorldTour promotion and relegation</a> cycle and the battle for points through stage wins and high placings in races has been intensified recently by the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/xds-astana-2025\">incredible resurgence of XDS-Astana</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously looking down and out at the end of 2024, they have been completely rejuvenated in 2025 and have catapulted to third in the team rankings for the season. They had consistent top tens throughout the Classics and have hunted for opportunities at lower level races, which included a dominant display at the Tour of Türkiye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top 18 teams achieve WorldTour status from 2026 for the next cycle. At the moment, Picnic-PostNL sit in 18th on 21,301 points, but XDS-Astana are breathing down their necks on 21,264.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Red Bull KM</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-06-122233-970x533.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-06-122233-970x533.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-06-122233-300x165.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-06-122233-768x422.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-06-122233-750x412.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-06-122233.webp 1120w\" /><figcaption>Red Bull</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-news-2025-caleb-ewan\">Red Bull KM</a> is a new addition for the Giro awarding time bonuses on every stage apart from the TTs, with six, four and two seconds available on the line. It comes at varying places on each stage, including on top of the Colle Pinzuto climb on Stage 9 and just prior to the Colle delle Finestre on Stage 20.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These alternating positions mean the time bonuses are up for grabs for a wide variety of riders, and could make a real difference to the overall standings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Eyes on Visma-Lease a Bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214205525.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214205525.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214205525-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214205525-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214205525-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214205525-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214205525-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214205525-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214205525-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Visma-Lease a Bike are desperate to turn around their misfortunes after a tough Classics season, and they head to the Giro with a balanced team. Simon Yates is the man for general classification with both Wout van Aert and Olav Kooij eyeing stage wins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Aert crashed out of the Vuelta last year while leading the points and mountains classifications. Despite not managing to win throughout the Classics, the Belgian was able to notch up two podiums and three fourth places, just lacking the decisive kick. Kooij has three victories so far in stages at the Tour of Oman and Tirreno-Adriatico, and he’ll be looking to end his spell with the team on a high as he’s rumoured to be on the way to Decathlon-AG2R next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclist newsletter banner saying 'stay one step ahead of the pack, click here to sign up'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-2025-storylines\">Six Giro d’Italia 2025 storylines to follow outside of the GC</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"6dad9d20371b4767b8991328b60871e722f3bc07ad9101e97e874accd3769dc3","category":"Cycling"}
