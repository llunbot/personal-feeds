He had been watching the fire for a couple of days, but business as usual was what they did in Alberta in the spring; it was wildfire season, after all.

By 10 that night, much of the city that was not yet incinerated was burning.</p>\n<p>The combination of extreme, record-breakingly high temperatures (91° F) with extreme, record-breakingly low humidity (15 percent), wind, and tons of dry fuel made for perfect fire weather. While this explosive combination used to be unattainable, it is occurring with growing frequency around the globe, including in areas that never experienced wildfires before.</p>\n<p>After destroying the city and the mines that fueled everything about it, the Fort McMurray Fire went on to burn for 15 months, until August 2, 2017. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/43aBQqS\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Fire Weather</i></a> tells its story, and tries to place it in the context of our warming world.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942536#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942536&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Diana Gitig","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"91de9780370c5303a3df6fe60d89c3addca73b9a02eb22e683784423e091c0b1","category":"Tech"}
