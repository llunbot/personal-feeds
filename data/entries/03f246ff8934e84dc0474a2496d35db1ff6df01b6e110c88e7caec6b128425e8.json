And a key feature that follows on years of bright AVIP gear from the Swedes, the limited edition hydration vest is bright orange with reflective accents for high visibility, because if you are riding far enough to need one of these, you’ll likely be riding through the dark and maybe even a bit sleep deprived. Plus, to keep you extra safe on the bike, there’s a Team Amani edition of their great new POC Cytal, which is still the top-safety-rated road helmet in independent <a href=\"https://www.helmet.beam.vt.edu/bicycle-helmet-ratings.html#!\" target=\"_blank\">Virginia Tech Helmet Ratings</a> testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>POC x Team Amani new Ultra Vest ultra-cycling hydration vest</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/POC-x-Team-Amani-collab_all-new-Ultra-Vest-hydration-vest-and-limited-edition-Cytal-aero-road-helmet-for-gravel-ultra-cycling-racing_rider.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/POC-x-Team-Amani-collab_all-new-Ultra-Vest-hydration-vest-and-limited-edition-Cytal-aero-road-helmet-for-gravel-ultra-cycling-racing_rider.webp\" alt=\"POC x Team Amani collab, all-new Ultra Vest hydration vest and limited edition Cytal aero road helmet for gravel ultra cycling racing, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/POC-x-Team-Amani-collab_all-new-Ultra-Vest-hydration-vest-and-limited-edition-Cytal-aero-road-helmet-for-gravel-ultra-cycling-racing_rider.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/POC-x-Team-Amani-collab_all-new-Ultra-Vest-hydration-vest-and-limited-edition-Cytal-aero-road-helmet-for-gravel-ultra-cycling-racing_rider-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/POC-x-Team-Amani-collab_all-new-Ultra-Vest-hydration-vest-and-limited-edition-Cytal-aero-road-helmet-for-gravel-ultra-cycling-racing_rider-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/POC-x-Team-Amani-collab_all-new-Ultra-Vest-hydration-vest-and-limited-edition-Cytal-aero-road-helmet-for-gravel-ultra-cycling-racing_rider-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/POC-x-Team-Amani-collab_all-new-Ultra-Vest-hydration-vest-and-limited-edition-Cytal-aero-road-helmet-for-gravel-ultra-cycling-racing_rider-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(All photos POC/Finley Newmark)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again, POC and Team Amani have paired up for a new collaboration collection meant to “channel the team’s raw energy and celebrates their deep-rooted fire and purpose”.

So its core function was to haul water and food – a pouch for a 2L hydration bladder and a total of 7 more pockets to carry as much as you could want. But it had to keep the riders cool, too, so the entire thing is made of an open mesh to max out breathability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, with long all-day and often multi-day adventure races, POC sought to boost rider safety by making them more visible, as well. That’s something we’ve seen lacking from most cycling hydration vests, so the hi-viz look is a welcome change for riders used to racing through the night.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ultra Vest – Tech details</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/POC-Team-Amani-Ultra-Vest-hydration-vest-for-gravel-ultra-cycling-racing_pocket-detail.webp\"><img width=\"1400\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/POC-Team-Amani-Ultra-Vest-hydration-vest-for-gravel-ultra-cycling-racing_pocket-detail.webp\" alt=\"POC x Team Amani Ultra Vest hydration vest for gravel ultra cycling racing, pocket details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/POC-Team-Amani-Ultra-Vest-hydration-vest-for-gravel-ultra-cycling-racing_pocket-detail.webp 1400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/POC-Team-Amani-Ultra-Vest-hydration-vest-for-gravel-ultra-cycling-racing_pocket-detail-297x64.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/POC-Team-Amani-Ultra-Vest-hydration-vest-for-gravel-ultra-cycling-racing_pocket-detail-120x26.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/POC-Team-Amani-Ultra-Vest-hydration-vest-for-gravel-ultra-cycling-racing_pocket-detail-768x165.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>light mesh construction throughout for maximum breathability</li>\n\n\n\n<li>bright orange color with reflective details for maximum day &amp; night visibility</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2 front zippered pockets that will fit a phone or snacks</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2 front top-load pockets designed to securely hold soft water bottles</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2 open side stash pockets under your arms for snacks or empty wrappers</li>\n\n\n\n<li>open-top rear pocket for a 2L hydration bladder (not included) plus hydration hose loops</li>\n\n\n\n<li>large open rear pass-through pocket to stash a jacket</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3 adjustable elastic chest straps for secure, one-hand fit adjustment</li>\n\n\n\n<li>short length designed to not block traditional jersey pockets</li>\n\n\n\n<li>slim fit with 3 sizes available (S,M &amp; L) for 87-104cm chest circumferences</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Limited edition Team Amani Cytal MIPS helmet</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/POC-Amani-Cytal-limited-edition-aero-road-helmet_angled-rear.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/POC-Amani-Cytal-limited-edition-aero-road-helmet_angled-rear.webp\" alt=\"POC Amani Cytal limited edition aero road helmet, rear detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/POC-Amani-Cytal-limited-edition-aero-road-helmet_angled-rear.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/POC-Amani-Cytal-limited-edition-aero-road-helmet_angled-rear-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/POC-Amani-Cytal-limited-edition-aero-road-helmet_angled-rear-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/POC-Amani-Cytal-limited-edition-aero-road-helmet_angled-rear-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/POC-Amani-Cytal-limited-edition-aero-road-helmet_angled-rear-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What more do I have to say about the POC Cytal MIPS that I haven’t already said <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/poc-cytal-road-helmet-is-light-aero-fast-and-the-safest-on-the-market-review/\" target=\"_blank\">when I reviewed it</a> just over two months ago?

It is taller than many similarly shaped aero road helmets, which helps let a lot of air flow through to cool your head.
