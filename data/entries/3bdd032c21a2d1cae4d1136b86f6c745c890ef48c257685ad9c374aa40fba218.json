YouTube's subscription data didn't make it into <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/google-earnings-100-million-google-one-subscribers-google-cloud-profits/\">the earnings call</a>Â three days ago.</p>\n<p>It's hard to know what exactly is driving YouTube's subscriptions. Premium gets you both ad-free YouTube videos and YouTube Music, and it's easy to imagine people sticking to one or the other. Ad-free videos have been getting the most aggressive promotion lately, with Google <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/11/youtube-tries-to-kill-ad-blockers-in-push-for-ad-dollars-premium-subs/\">cracking down</a> on ad-block users by blocking video playback and displaying interstitial pop-ups. After warning users that ad blockers violate YouTube's terms of service, the pop-ups show a big \"try YouTube Premium\" button. Premium also added an exclusive \"enhanced bitrate\" 1080p setting, although 2K, 4K, and 8K options have always been free.</p>\n<p>There's not much new on the music side of things. YouTube Music is free with ads and a more limited feature set, but subscribing gets you ad-free playback, background playback on phones, and access to YouTube Music streaming on Google's various speakers. YouTube's blog post highlights quotes from many big music industry CEOs celebrating the service.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000791#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000791&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3bdd032c21a2d1cae4d1136b86f6c745c890ef48c257685ad9c374aa40fba218","category":"Tech"}
