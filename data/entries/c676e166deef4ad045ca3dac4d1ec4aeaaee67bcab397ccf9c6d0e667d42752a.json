{"title":"iOS 18 Messages Bug, Triggered When Sharing an Apple Watch Face, Causes Crash and Data Loss","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/18/ios-18-messages-app-crash/","date":1727110033000,"content":"\n<p>Zac Hall, with a public service message at 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For now, the bug is triggered when someone replies to a shared\nwatch face in a thread on Messages in iOS 18. The <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/104974\">threaded\nresponses feature</a> allows you to have an inline\nconversation about a specific message that may have been sent\nearlier in the chat.</p>\n\n<p>If this happens, Messages will repeatedly crash if the user tries\nto open the conversation in the app. Sending or responding to\nconversations from other chats directly in Messages is also not\neasily possible as the app may repeatedly crash.</p>\n\n<p>Once triggered, the bug affects both users. It appears to require\nresponding to the shared watch face from iOS 18. Replying from iOS\n18.1 will not trigger the bug.</p>\n\n<p>However, if the user responds in a thread to the shared watch\nface, Messages will crash on iOS 18.1 beta, iPadOS 18.1 beta, and\nmacOS 15.1 beta as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I suspect we’ll see an iOS 18.0.1 update imminently that includes a fix for this. It’s a nasty bug, though.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/23/ios-18-messages-watch-face-sharing-bug\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c676e166deef4ad045ca3dac4d1ec4aeaaee67bcab397ccf9c6d0e667d42752a","category":"Tech"}
