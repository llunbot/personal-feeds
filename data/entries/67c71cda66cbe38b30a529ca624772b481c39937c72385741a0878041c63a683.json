The outlet is sad that the iPhone 15 Plus lasts so long between charges, resulting in the device being plugged in less often.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's tech specs say the iPhone 15 Plus can provide up to 26 hours of offline video playback, and up to 100 hours of audio playback.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's video description:<blockquote>Big screen. Big battery life. iPhone 15 Plus is here. Dynamic Island. New 48MP Main camera. 2x Telephoto. Next-generation portraits. Water resistant (IP68). USB-C. Durable color-infused glass. Aluminum design. You don't want to miss it.</blockquote>The ad was also shared as a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OFP0c6zBVHs\">YouTube Short</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/\">Apple Ads</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15\">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/24/iphone-15-plus-battery-life-ad/\">Apple Shares iPhone 15 Plus Ad Highlighting Device's Long Battery Life</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shares-iphone-15-plus-ad-highlighting-devices-long-battery-life.2414578/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"67c71cda66cbe38b30a529ca624772b481c39937c72385741a0878041c63a683","category":"Apple"}
