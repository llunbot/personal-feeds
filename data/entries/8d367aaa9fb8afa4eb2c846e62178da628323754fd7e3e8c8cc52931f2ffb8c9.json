Finally, a 3T gravel bike gets 3-bolt Anything cage mounts on its fork. A surprisingly long time coming, it really is a prerequisite for a gravel bike to be a proper bikepacking-ready adventure bike. Also, with the external cable loop gone from behind the stem, the new 3T Extrema Italia Integrale also benefits from better location for direct mount toptube bags. Combine that with a standard set of 2 cage bolts under the downtube, a standard cage mount on the seattube, and a 3-bolt set of adjustable position water bottle cage mounts on top of the downtube. And this Extrema Italia has the most carrying capacity of any 3T gravel bike yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-3T-Exploro-Extrema-Italia_carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_eound-seatpost-with-internal-wedge-clamp.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-3T-Exploro-Extrema-Italia_carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_eound-seatpost-with-internal-wedge-clamp.jpg\" alt=\"3T Extrema Italia Integrale, all-new carbon fat tire 29er aero adventure gravel bike, made-in-Italy, round 27.2mm seatpost\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-3T-Exploro-Extrema-Italia_carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_eound-seatpost-with-internal-wedge-clamp.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-3T-Exploro-Extrema-Italia_carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_eound-seatpost-with-internal-wedge-clamp-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-3T-Exploro-Extrema-Italia_carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_eound-seatpost-with-internal-wedge-clamp-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-3T-Exploro-Extrema-Italia_carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_eound-seatpost-with-internal-wedge-clamp-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-3T-Exploro-Extrema-Italia_carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_eound-seatpost-with-internal-wedge-clamp-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-3T-Exploro-Extrema-Italia_carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_eound-seatpost-with-internal-wedge-clamp-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-3T-Exploro-Extrema-Italia_carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_eound-seatpost-with-internal-wedge-clamp-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The round 27.2mm seatpost debuted on the Ultra is here on the Extrema too. 3T makes the shift for more rider comfort and the ability to optionally run a wireless (or externally routed) dropper post or a suspension seatpost, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>More progressive gravel-race geometry, too</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-3T-Exploro-Extrema-Italia_carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_riding-in-winter-forest.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-3T-Exploro-Extrema-Italia_carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_riding-in-winter-forest.jpg\" alt=\"3T Extrema Italia Integrale, all-new carbon fat tire 29er aero adventure gravel bike, made-in-Italy, winter forest riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-3T-Exploro-Extrema-Italia_carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_riding-in-winter-forest.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-3T-Exploro-Extrema-Italia_carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_riding-in-winter-forest-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-3T-Exploro-Extrema-Italia_carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_riding-in-winter-forest-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-3T-Exploro-Extrema-Italia_carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_riding-in-winter-forest-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-3T-Exploro-Extrema-Italia_carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_riding-in-winter-forest-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-3T-Exploro-Extrema-Italia_carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_riding-in-winter-forest-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The changes are relatively small compared to the Ultra, which is almost identical to the RaceMax except for an incrementally longer rear center and slightly shorter Reach.

Tire fit is important to 3T. As they really aerodynamically optimize each of their bikes for a certain range of tire sizes. And 3T want to be sure you get the most out of their bikes. So buyers pick from lots of tires, but still get the ideal fit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to dig into the details, it’s great. If you just want to know what the difference bike-to-bike is, it can be overwhelming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As briefly as possible…</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The new <strong>Extrema Italia</strong> is optimized for 700c x 50-57mm tires (29″ x 1.95-2.25″). With the same wide tire aerodynamics as the Ultra but on bigger diameter wheels. 3T designed the Extrema “for the toughest race courses and fast adventures”.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3T optimized the <strong>RaceMax</strong> in regular or Italia guise for 700c x 35-40mm tires (up to 42mm possible). It can also run 650b x 53mm / 27.5″ x 2.1″ tires (up to 61mm/2.4″ possible) with less aero efficiency. It targets fast gravel race courses and mixed hard surface, tarmac &amp; gravel riding.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>They specifically designed the <strong>Ultra</strong> around 27.5″ x 2.25″ / 650b x 57mm tires (up to 2.4″ / 61mm possible). Featuring wider tubing for optimal aerodynamics with wider tires. It aims more at casual adventure-focused riders at a more affordable price level. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>Italia</em> means lightweight, stiff carbon, made-in-Italy</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Italia_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Bergamo-factory-HQ.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Italia_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Bergamo-factory-HQ.jpg\" alt=\"3T Italia premium carbon gravel bikes, made in-house in Bergamo, Italy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Italia_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Bergamo-factory-HQ.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Italia_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Bergamo-factory-HQ-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Italia_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Bergamo-factory-HQ-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Italia_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Bergamo-factory-HQ-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Italia_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Bergamo-factory-HQ-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Italia_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Bergamo-factory-HQ-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Italia_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Bergamo-factory-HQ-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/3T)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>3T manufactures the new 3T Extrema Italia Integrale in Italy to be lightweight and stiff like the other Italia editions. But it also aims to boost comfort, too. Specifically, 3T engineered the new adventure gravel race bike to be just as stiff and responsive as the RaceMax from the headtube, to the bottom bracket, and back to the dropouts. But, it gets more flex in the seatstays &amp; seattube to boost rider comfort over rougher terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Extrema-Italia-Integrale_new-carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_Project-X-raw-frameset-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Extrema-Italia-Integrale_new-carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_Project-X-raw-frameset-detail.jpg\" alt=\"3T Extrema Italia Integrale, all-new carbon fat tire 29er aero adventure gravel bike, made-in-Italy, Project X frameset detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Extrema-Italia-Integrale_new-carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_Project-X-raw-frameset-detail.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Extrema-Italia-Integrale_new-carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_Project-X-raw-frameset-detail-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Extrema-Italia-Integrale_new-carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_Project-X-raw-frameset-detail-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Extrema-Italia-Integrale_new-carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_Project-X-raw-frameset-detail-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Extrema-Italia-Integrale_new-carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_Project-X-raw-frameset-detail-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Extrema-Italia-Integrale_new-carbon-fat-tire-29er-aero-adventure-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_Project-X-raw-frameset-detail-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>(Studio Photos/3T)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, it’s still pretty light. 3T claims an unpainted 54cm Extrema Italia Integrale frame weighs 1100g without hardware. Or just 110g more than a same size RaceMax Italia Integrale frame. The new adventure-ready fork is also similarly lightweight at a claimed 420g, unpainted without hardware. That’s surprisingly only 35g heavier than the RaceMax Italia fork.

The new SRAM Transmissions require a wider 55mm chainline, but the current Torno cranks are 47mm. 3T are working on producing a new wider Torno while keeping Q-factor as low as possible. In the meantime, 3T is shipping bikes (like our test bike) with a wide SRAM Rival crank now. 3T will upgrade Tornos buyers for free in June 2024, once the new cranks are slated for available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Just-in-time Delivery at your local bikeshop</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Inside-3T-Cycling-Factory-Tour_How-3T-Torno-carbon-cranks-are-made-by-hand_made-in-Italy_inside.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Inside-3T-Cycling-Factory-Tour_How-3T-Torno-carbon-cranks-are-made-by-hand_made-in-Italy_inside.jpg\" alt=\"Inside 3T Cycling Factory Tour, How 3T Torno carbon cranks are made by hand, 100% made-in-Italy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Inside-3T-Cycling-Factory-Tour_How-3T-Torno-carbon-cranks-are-made-by-hand_made-in-Italy_inside.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Inside-3T-Cycling-Factory-Tour_How-3T-Torno-carbon-cranks-are-made-by-hand_made-in-Italy_inside-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Inside-3T-Cycling-Factory-Tour_How-3T-Torno-carbon-cranks-are-made-by-hand_made-in-Italy_inside-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Inside-3T-Cycling-Factory-Tour_How-3T-Torno-carbon-cranks-are-made-by-hand_made-in-Italy_inside-768x480.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Inside-3T-Cycling-Factory-Tour_How-3T-Torno-carbon-cranks-are-made-by-hand_made-in-Italy_inside-800x500.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Inside-3T-Cycling-Factory-Tour_How-3T-Torno-carbon-cranks-are-made-by-hand_made-in-Italy_inside-696x435.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Inside-3T-Cycling-Factory-Tour_How-3T-Torno-carbon-cranks-are-made-by-hand_made-in-Italy_inside-1068x668.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Inside-3T-Cycling-Factory-Tour_How-3T-Torno-carbon-cranks-are-made-by-hand_made-in-Italy_inside-672x420.jpg 672w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One key behind-the-scenes update making this Extrema &amp; other Italia models available in a timely fashion is new Just-in-Time delivery. Replacing conventional shop pre-season pre-orders, key 3T dealer shops are now able to reserve the 5000 production slots for the Italia series bikes for the 2024 year ahead. That way they still estimate how many premium 3T bikes they expect to sell in the next year. But then get to pick the specific model, size, color &amp; build spec almost at the last minute. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means that if your local shop reserved production slots, they can likely get you the exact semi-customized bike &amp; build you want in around 6 weeks, instead of the much longer lead times a made-to-order carbon bike would usually entail. Modern 3T re-founder &amp; CEO Rene Wiertz describe this as a huge benefit of the flexibility of manufacturing the Italia models in-house with the filament wound RTM technique.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New 3T Management</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-managment-change_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Rene-Wiertz-steps-down-as-CEO.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-managment-change_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Rene-Wiertz-steps-down-as-CEO.jpg\" alt=\"Modern 3T founder &amp; owner Rene Wiertz steps down as CEO\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-managment-change_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Rene-Wiertz-steps-down-as-CEO.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-managment-change_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Rene-Wiertz-steps-down-as-CEO-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-managment-change_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Rene-Wiertz-steps-down-as-CEO-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-managment-change_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Rene-Wiertz-steps-down-as-CEO-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-managment-change_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Rene-Wiertz-steps-down-as-CEO-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-managment-change_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Rene-Wiertz-steps-down-as-CEO-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-managment-change_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Rene-Wiertz-steps-down-as-CEO-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/3T)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another tidbit of 3T industry news is a reorganization of their management. Last year, Italian investment firm UTurn bought into 3T on this idea of increasing nimble made-in-Italy manufacturing. Now Rene Wiertz, has sold his stake and stepped down as CEO of the company that he bought as a name only back in 2007 and turned into a component, then gravel bike manufacturing powerhouse together with Gerard Vroomen and now 70 employees. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Italia_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Bergamo-factory-inside.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Italia_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Bergamo-factory-inside.jpg\" alt=\"3T Italia premium carbon gravel bikes, made in-house in Bergamo, Italy \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Italia_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Bergamo-factory-inside.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Italia_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Bergamo-factory-inside-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Italia_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Bergamo-factory-inside-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Italia_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Bergamo-factory-inside-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Italia_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Bergamo-factory-inside-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3T-Italia_carbon-aero-gravel-bikes-made-in-Italy_Bergamo-factory-inside-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/3T)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking over the 3T CEO management role is UTurn’s Luca Mongodi, saying “<em>3T is changing the game of the bike industry, and we are happy to be able to accelerate this fundamental change with our investment in the in-house carbon factory and bike assembly and creating sustainable jobs in Italy</em>“. Wiertz &amp; Mongodi see this as a great opportunity for 3T to grow even bigger &amp; better internationally, while focusing on what they do best. 3T promised that “all” of their bike models will be available in Italia versions by the end of this year. Which the Extrema seems to reinforce. And 3T plans to “rapidly” expand Italian production capacity next year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expect to see even more Italian-made bikes. As UTurn fuels 3T to grow its tech-focused approach to gravel, ebikes, and all-road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.3t.bike/en/\" target=\"_blank\">3T.bike</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/3t-extrema-italia-gets-faster-gnarlier-for-gravel-bike-adventure-racing/\">3T Extrema Italia gets Faster, Gnarlier for Gravel Bike Adventure Racing</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"8d367aaa9fb8afa4eb2c846e62178da628323754fd7e3e8c8cc52931f2ffb8c9","category":"Cycling"}
