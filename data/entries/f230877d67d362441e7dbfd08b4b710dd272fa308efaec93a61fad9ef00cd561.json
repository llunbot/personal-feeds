The FAA ordered this review after SpaceX updated the regulatory agency on the projected Starship launch rate and the design of the ground infrastructure needed at Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A), the historic launch pad once used for Apollo and Space Shuttle missions.</p>\n<h2>Dual environmental reviews</h2>\n<p>At the same time, the US Space Force is overseeing a similar EIS for SpaceX's proposal to take over a launch pad at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, a few miles south of LC-39A. This launch pad, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/02/spacex-wants-to-take-over-a-florida-launch-pad-from-rival-ula/\">designated Space Launch Complex 37 (SLC-37</a>), is available for use after <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/04/after-a-fiery-finale-the-delta-rocket-family-now-belongs-to-history/\">United Launch Alliance's last Delta rocket</a> lifted off there in April.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024867#p3\">Read 56 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024867&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f230877d67d362441e7dbfd08b4b710dd272fa308efaec93a61fad9ef00cd561","category":"Tech"}
