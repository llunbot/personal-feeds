It is unclear if the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air would ramp down to 10Hz or 1Hz.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus still have 60Hz displays.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYoung has a good track record with display-related information about future Apple products, including being the first source to reveal that the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/\">would feature larger 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays</a>, respectively.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce the iPhone 17 series in September 2025.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/\">Ross Young</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/iphone-17-and-17-air-120hz-promotion-rumor/\">iPhone 17 and 'iPhone 17 Air' Rumored to Feature 120Hz ProMotion Displays</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-and-iphone-17-air-rumored-to-feature-120hz-promotion-displays.2437281/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2a1629fb69064aaa879e40a4ead6f8be144c998b9f16ab5db34178a86c7504bc","category":"Apple"}
