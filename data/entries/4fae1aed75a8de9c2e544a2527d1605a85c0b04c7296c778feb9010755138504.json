In 2022, for example, Foxconn's Chennai facility began production of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> ten days after the global launch, but it took around a month for the locally made iPhones to be available in the country. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis year locally made ‌iPhone 15‌ models will initially cater to the Indian market exclusively, but exports to Europe and the U.S. are expected to begin after December. The shift signals the company's gradual progress in diversifying its supply chain away from China, with Apple now the largest smartphone exporter in India.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLate last month, a device presumed to be an ‌iPhone 15‌ model was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/25/another-iphone-15-spotted-in-database/\">spotted</a> in India's regulatory database. A similar thing happened around the same time last year: Just a few weeks before the announcement of the ‌‌iPhone 14‌‌ lineup, a single ‌iPhone 14‌ model was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/23/iphone-14-reportedly-spotted-in-indian-regulatory-filings/\">spotted</a> in the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) database that turned out to be the standard ‌‌iPhone 14‌‌ model built for \"other countries and regions.\" New Apple devices being spotted in global regulatory databases often indicates that launch is soon to follow. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has raised its sales target by almost 100% year-on-year for over 200 Premium Reseller stores in India in the second and third quarters, according to <em>The Economic Times</em>. Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> in his latest earnings call <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/03/apple-3q-2023-results/\">said</a> that the company broke revenue records in the country and saw sales grow by double digits in what is the third largest smartphone market in the world.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/07/when-will-iphone-15-be-released/\">When Will the iPhone 15 Be Released?</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nApple is planning to announce the ‌‌iPhone 15‌‌ lineup at its \"Wonderlust\" event on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/\">Tuesday, September 12</a>, with the devices likely <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/07/when-will-iphone-15-be-released/\">launching a few days after</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/\">India</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/05/india-among-first-iphone-15-launch-markets/\">India on Course to Be Among First iPhone 15 Launch Markets</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/india-on-course-to-be-among-first-iphone-15-launch-markets.2400488/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4fae1aed75a8de9c2e544a2527d1605a85c0b04c7296c778feb9010755138504","category":"Apple"}
