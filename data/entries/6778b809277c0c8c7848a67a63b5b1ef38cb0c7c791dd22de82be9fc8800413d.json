For about century, the Elwha and Gilnes Canyon Dams corralled these waters. Both have since been removed, and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olym/learn/nature/restoration-and-current-research.htm\">restoration of the watershed</a> has started.</p>\n<p>The dam-removal project was the largest to date in the US—though it won’t hold that position for long. The Klamath River dam removal project has begun, with four of its six dams—J.C. Boyle, Copco No. 1, Copco No. 2, and Iron Gate—set to be scuppered by the end of the year, and the drawdown started this week. (In fact, Copco No. 2 <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/article/2023/07/16/klamath-dam-removal-copco-2/\">is already gone</a>.)</p>\n<p>Once the project is complete, the Klamath will run from Oregon to northwestern California largely unimpeded, allowing sediment, organic matter, and its restive waters to flow freely downriver while fish like salmon, trout, and other migratory species leap and wriggle their way upstream to spawn.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994887#p3\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994887&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6778b809277c0c8c7848a67a63b5b1ef38cb0c7c791dd22de82be9fc8800413d","category":"Tech"}
