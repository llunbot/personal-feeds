A study published last month <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-funded-study-finds-long-covid-affects-adolescents-differently-younger-children\">suggests</a> preteens are more likely to experience symptoms such as headaches, stomach pain, trouble sleeping, and attention difficulties. Even among children, effects seem to vary by age. “There seems to be some differences between age groups, with less signs of organ damage in younger children and more adultlike disease in adolescents,” says Petter Brodin, professor of pediatric immunology at Imperial College London.</p>\n<p>While vast sums have been devoted to long COVID research—the US National Institutes of Health have spent <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2023/04/20/long-covid-nih-billion/\">more than a billion dollars</a> on research projects and clinical trials—research into children with the condition has been <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(24)00394-8/fulltext\">predominantly limited</a> to online surveys, calls with parents, and studies of electronic health records.
