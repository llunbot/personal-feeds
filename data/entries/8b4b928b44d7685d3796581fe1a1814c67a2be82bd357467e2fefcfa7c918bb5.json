For some reason, that process seems to have fallen through the cracks this month—images are available now for Microsoft's Hyper-V hypervisor but are conspicuously missing for competing hypervisors VMWare, Parallels, and VirtualBox.</p>\n<div><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/windowsdev?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@windowsdev</a> It's pretty telling that you guys have let the free VMWare/VirtualBox/Parallels Windows dev images expire but updated the HyperV image.

The images themselves are decidedly ephemeral—they expire each month, requiring devs using the program to download new, refreshed images.</p>\n<p>June's developer VM images expired five days ago (July 10), and despite several days of Boyette's angry tweets, the missing VM images are still missing. While VM images for Hyper-V—Microsoft's own hypervisor—were uploaded to the portal on time, devs who use VMWare, VirtualBox, or Parallels to host their virtual machines are still out of luck.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780313#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780313&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8b4b928b44d7685d3796581fe1a1814c67a2be82bd357467e2fefcfa7c918bb5","category":"Tech"}
