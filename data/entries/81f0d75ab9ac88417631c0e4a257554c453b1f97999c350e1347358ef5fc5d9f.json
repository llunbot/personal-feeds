For example, users of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/apple-wallet-app-discover-card-balance/\">Discover cards</a> were first to see the option to view their total card balance and transaction history in Apple Wallet. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nNote that if you don't see the option to Get Started below your card in the Wallet app, your card issuer currently isn't eligible. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/\">Apple Wallet</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/10/more-uk-banks-show-account-balance-apple-wallet/\">More UK Bank Cards Now Show Account Balance in Apple Wallet</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/more-uk-bank-cards-now-show-account-balance-in-apple-wallet.2410543/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"81f0d75ab9ac88417631c0e4a257554c453b1f97999c350e1347358ef5fc5d9f","category":"Apple"}
