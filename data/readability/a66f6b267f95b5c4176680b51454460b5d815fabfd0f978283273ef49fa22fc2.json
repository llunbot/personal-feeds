DT Swiss calls the 1900 Spline wheel family their “first step” into trusted DT quality, durability &amp; performance. Moving to their recent Ratchet LN upgrade internals, it signals a move away from less-strong pawl hubs towards longer running wheels, even at an affordable price point. The trick here though, even though they are still affordable, the new 19000 wheels do look to go up in price by more than 30% vs. the old 3-pawl 1900s.</p><h3>What’s new?</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/13100253/DT-Swiss-1900-Spline-MTB-wheels-upgrade-to-Ratchet-LN-hubs_detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/13100253/DT-Swiss-1900-Spline-MTB-wheels-upgrade-to-Ratchet-LN-hubs_detail.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss 1900 Spline MTB wheels upgrade to Ratchet LN hubs\" width=\"1891\" height=\"1134\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/13100253/DT-Swiss-1900-Spline-MTB-wheels-upgrade-to-Ratchet-LN-hubs_detail.jpg 1891w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/13100253/DT-Swiss-1900-Spline-MTB-wheels-upgrade-to-Ratchet-LN-hubs_detail-297x178.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/13100253/DT-Swiss-1900-Spline-MTB-wheels-upgrade-to-Ratchet-LN-hubs_detail-800x480.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/13100253/DT-Swiss-1900-Spline-MTB-wheels-upgrade-to-Ratchet-LN-hubs_detail-120x72.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/13100253/DT-Swiss-1900-Spline-MTB-wheels-upgrade-to-Ratchet-LN-hubs_detail-768x461.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/13100253/DT-Swiss-1900-Spline-MTB-wheels-upgrade-to-Ratchet-LN-hubs_detail-1536x921.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1891px) 100vw, 1891px\"></a></p><p>The new wheels are built around an updated 370 hubset that’s not very different on the outside, but now features 18T Ratchet LN internals inside (like their new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/09/15/dt-swiss-240-hybrid-exp-hubs-wheels-get-built-tougher-for-modern-e-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hybrid wheels</a> did too).

(Interestingly, DT has a good <a href=\"https://www.dtswiss.com/en/wheels/wheels-technology/engagement-angle-technology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">detailed explanation of points of engagement</a>, and why more isn’t always better for mountain bikers.)</p><h3>Tech details &amp; Options</h3><p>DT Swiss builds the 1900 wheels to be an accessible wheel upgrade for any type of mountain biker, with higher system weight limits (rider+bike+gear) for the more burly wheels.

Now, all three versions cross-country X, all-mountain M &amp; enduro E start at the same $609 / 449€ pricing. Even factoring in overall industry price increases, that’s a sizable jump up from the previous 1900s ($427/439/465 or 336/346/367€, respectively), but should offer longer-lasting wheels to more riders without going super expensive.</p><div id=\"attachment_274716\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/13100230/DT-Swiss-1900-Spline-MTB-wheels-upgrade-to-Ratchet-LN-hubs_Gaudenz-mountains.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-274716\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/13100230/DT-Swiss-1900-Spline-MTB-wheels-upgrade-to-Ratchet-LN-hubs_Gaudenz-mountains.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss 1900 Spline MTB wheels upgrade to Ratchet LN hubs, riding\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/13100230/DT-Swiss-1900-Spline-MTB-wheels-upgrade-to-Ratchet-LN-hubs_Gaudenz-mountains.jpg 1800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/13100230/DT-Swiss-1900-Spline-MTB-wheels-upgrade-to-Ratchet-LN-hubs_Gaudenz-mountains-297x165.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/13100230/DT-Swiss-1900-Spline-MTB-wheels-upgrade-to-Ratchet-LN-hubs_Gaudenz-mountains-800x444.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/13100230/DT-Swiss-1900-Spline-MTB-wheels-upgrade-to-Ratchet-LN-hubs_Gaudenz-mountains-120x67.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/13100230/DT-Swiss-1900-Spline-MTB-wheels-upgrade-to-Ratchet-LN-hubs_Gaudenz-mountains-768x427.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/13100230/DT-Swiss-1900-Spline-MTB-wheels-upgrade-to-Ratchet-LN-hubs_Gaudenz-mountains-1536x853.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-274716\">all photos c.
