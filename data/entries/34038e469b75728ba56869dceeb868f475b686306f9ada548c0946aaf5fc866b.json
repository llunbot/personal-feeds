These large predators were lost during the Late Pleistocene extinctions that eliminated many large land mammals from the Americas near the end of the most recent glaciation. Now, in a coordinated PR blitz, the company is claiming that clones of gray wolves with lightly edited genomes have essentially brought the dire wolf back. (Both <a href=\"https://time.com/7274542/colossal-dire-wolf/\">Time</a> and <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/04/14/the-dire-wolf-is-back?_sp=06490e9d-e826-4489-8a60-79f0d501a2e8.1744044989139\">The New Yorker</a> were given exclusive access to the animals ahead of the announcement.)</p>\n<p>The dire wolf is a relative of the now-common gray wolf, with clear differences apparent between the two species' skeletons. Based on the sequence of two new dire wolf genomes, the researchers at Colossal conclude that dire wolves formed a distinct branch within the canids over 2.5 million years ago. For context, that's over twice as long as brown and polar bears are estimated to have been distinct species. Dire wolves are also large, typically the size of the largest gray wolf populations. Comparisons between the new genomes and those of other canids show that the dire wolf also had a light-colored coat.</p>\n<p>That large of an evolutionary separation means there are likely a lot of genetic differences between the gray and dire wolves. Colossal's internal and unpublished analysis suggested that key differences could be made by editing 14 different areas of the genome, with 20 total edits required. The new animals are reported to have had 15 variants engineered in. It's unclear what accounts for the difference, and a Colossal spokesperson told Ars: \"We are not revealing all of the edits that we made at this point.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/de-extinction-company-announces-that-the-dire-wolf-is-back/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/de-extinction-company-announces-that-the-dire-wolf-is-back/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"34038e469b75728ba56869dceeb868f475b686306f9ada548c0946aaf5fc866b","category":"Tech"}
