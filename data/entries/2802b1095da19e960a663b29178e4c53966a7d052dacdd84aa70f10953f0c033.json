The FTC can now\nbring the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th\nCircuit, and the two companies must find a way forward to resolve\nopposition from the Competition and Markets Authority in the\nUnited Kingdom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The deadline to close the deal is next week, but the market expects it to happen:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Activision Blizzard shares reached a session high and 52-week high\nof $92.91 per share after the U.S. District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California issued the decision. Microsoft had agreed\nto buy the game publisher for $95 per share. Activision Blizzard\nstock ended Tuesday’s trading session at $90.99 per share, up 10%.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is another case where the Biden FTC is barking up the wrong tree.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/12/microsoft-activision-deal-closer\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2802b1095da19e960a663b29178e4c53966a7d052dacdd84aa70f10953f0c033","category":"Tech"}
