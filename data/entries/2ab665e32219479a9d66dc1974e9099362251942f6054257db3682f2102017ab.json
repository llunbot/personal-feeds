Kennedy Jr. has sued Meta for allegedly shadowbanning his million-dollar documentary, <em>Who Is Bobby Kennedy?</em> and preventing his supporters from advocating for his presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>According to Kennedy, Meta is colluding with the Biden administration to sway the 2024 presidential election by suppressing Kennedy's documentary and making it harder to support Kennedy's candidacy. This allegedly has caused \"substantial donation losses,\" while also violating the free speech rights of Kennedy, his supporters, and his film's production company, AV24.</p>\n<p>Meta had initially restricted the documentary on Facebook and Instagram but later fixed the issue after discovering that the film was mistakenly flagged by the platforms' automated spam filters.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025044#p3\">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025044&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2ab665e32219479a9d66dc1974e9099362251942f6054257db3682f2102017ab","category":"Tech"}
