And the other, the precise Portatec CNC milling machine. Working together, these two create every Actofive mountain bike and component.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CNC-machine and several of its unique features are produced by the company of Simon’s father, primarily for the aerospace industry. But instead of taking over the business, Simon always had other ideas of how to use these machines. And with mountain biking being his passion, Simon Metzner went out on his own to start up Metzner Engineering, a contract CNC-manufacturing company created to allow him to also further his MTB component and bike development. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_Simon-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_Simon-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Actofive Factory Tour: CNC machined alloy mountain bikes made in Dresden Germany, Simon Metzner\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_Simon-jpg.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_Simon-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_Simon-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_Simon-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_Simon-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So by mixing his expertise in manufacturing process optimization, the CNC capabilities of his small workshop, and deep mountain bike design knowledge, Simon has developed Actofive into a sought-after small German mountain bike manufacturer creating true CNC-machined MTB gems.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>From prototype to production</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_P-train-prototype-development-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_P-train-prototype-development-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Actofive Factory Tour: CNC machined alloy mountain bikes made in Dresden Germany, P-Train prototype\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_P-train-prototype-development-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_P-train-prototype-development-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_P-train-prototype-development-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_P-train-prototype-development-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_P-train-prototype-development-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_P-train-prototype-development-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_P-train-prototype-development-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We were first really introduced to Actofive’s high-pivot alloy P-Train about 3 years ago. But Simon has been working on that first adaptable-travel enduro bike for at least a few years longer, since 2018. That’s when he hung out his own shingle as Metzner Engineering, after leaving the family CNC machine production business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In its first iteration, the bike started with a welded steel front &amp; rear triangle joined together with CNC-machined alloy links. And it has continued to evolve in many iterations along the way. That original steel bike now sits in Simon’s office with a machined rear end quite similar to today’s production P-Train.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_3d-printed-possibilities-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_3d-printed-possibilities-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Actofive Factory Tour: CNC machined alloy mountain bikes made in Dresden Germany, steel &amp; titanium, maybe even 3D-printing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_3d-printed-possibilities-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_3d-printed-possibilities-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_3d-printed-possibilities-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_3d-printed-possibilities-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_3d-printed-possibilities-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_3d-printed-possibilities-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_3d-printed-possibilities-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And while CNC-machining aluminum has always been kind of in Simon’s blood, he isn’t entirely beholden to one material, or even the subtractive machining process. He’s toyed with other materials – like titanium – and also with the potential of modern 3D-printing capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_origin-of-the-P-Train-enduro-bike-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_origin-of-the-P-Train-enduro-bike-jpg.webp\" alt=\"ActoFive Factory Tour: CNC-machined aluminum mountain bikes made-in-Germany, first MTB prototype\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_origin-of-the-P-Train-enduro-bike-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_origin-of-the-P-Train-enduro-bike-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_origin-of-the-P-Train-enduro-bike-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_origin-of-the-P-Train-enduro-bike-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_origin-of-the-P-Train-enduro-bike-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But machining aluminum has defined the development of Actofive’s bikes and components these last 6 years, especially the use of intricate and well-thought-out milling designs. And it forms the basis for Actofive’s unique clamshell, or sandwich construction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Simon continues to show that he has more ideas on how to refine both his designs and their manufacturing. So there’s plenty evolution left to do in CNC-machined aluminum.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Inside Actofive’s factory tour: MTB parts in-process</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking around the Actofive workshop during our factory tour showed a pretty good sample of their complete offering, in various stages of completion. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_new-I-Train-main-frames-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_new-I-Train-main-frames-jpg.webp\" alt=\"ActoFive Factory Tour: CNC-machined aluminum mountain bikes made-in-Germany, I-train front triangles\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_new-I-Train-main-frames-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_new-I-Train-main-frames-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_new-I-Train-main-frames-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_new-I-Train-main-frames-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_new-I-Train-main-frames-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_new-I-Train-main-frames-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_new-I-Train-main-frames-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a couple of I-Train trail bike front triangles. The two halves have each been machined from both sides – the outside that we can see, plus the intricate inside webbed truss structure that Actofive doesn’t let anyone else see. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had a peek, and it’s even more impressive that the fine tool marks you see on the outside. The design of the inner structure allows Actofive the ability to fine-tune strength and stiffness at various locations within the mountain bike frame, while keeping it lightweight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Actofive is wary of giving away the secrets of how they achieve their balance of lightweight-to-strength. And especially resistant to give away the design of their interlocking system that is used to bond the two halves of a frame together to create the complete bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_cranks-mid-machining-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_cranks-mid-machining-jpg.webp\" alt=\"ActoFive Factory Tour: CNC-machined aluminum mountain bikes made-in-Germany, cranks mid-machining\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_cranks-mid-machining-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_cranks-mid-machining-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_cranks-mid-machining-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_cranks-mid-machining-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_cranks-mid-machining-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_cranks-mid-machining-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_cranks-mid-machining-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We also had a chance to watch some Actofive crankarms be machined in their first step during our factory tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>From alloy slabs to machined gems</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_aluminum-alloy-slabs-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_aluminum-alloy-slabs-jpg.webp\" alt=\"ActoFive Factory Tour: CNC-machined aluminum mountain bikes made-in-Germany, raw material\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_aluminum-alloy-slabs-jpg.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_aluminum-alloy-slabs-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_aluminum-alloy-slabs-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_aluminum-alloy-slabs-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The heart of everything that Actofive produces starts out as simple slab of aluminum billet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And really, most of Actofive’s components come down to machining one side to get the final outside shape. Then, flipping it over (and securing it to a negative fixture on the milling machine) to hollow out the second side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The simplest parts like their more affordable <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/actofive-signature-x-crankset-cnc-cuts-price-in-half-tougher-than-ever-at-bespoked/\" target=\"_blank\">Signature X</a> crankset, the P-train rear end, and the I-Train seatstays leave it at that, where you can see both sides that have been machined. But more complex hollow parts like the mountain bike front triangles &amp; Signature cranks, get 2-sided machining for each frame half that are then bonded together to create the more complex hollow structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_mini-crane-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_mini-crane-jpg.webp\" alt=\"ActoFive Factory Tour: CNC-machined aluminum mountain bikes made-in-Germany, mini crane for 1-man operation\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_mini-crane-jpg.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_mini-crane-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_mini-crane-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_mini-crane-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory_CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-made-in-Germany_mini-crane-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course, moving big heavy chunks of aluminum around is quite difficult before all that extra material is machined away (and collected for recycling).

CAD/CAM data, metal filings, and out of that… precision machined alloy components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Portatec CNC mill is the brawn. But the brains of the Siemens controller manages all the machining processes, tooling, and where those tool cut. While Simon can remotely operate everything from his computer upstairs, for production, everything is handled directly at the machine. There’s so much raw data governing the machining process, this ensures that any potential minor breakdown in communication couldn’t negatively affect the final work.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_aluminum-filings-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_aluminum-filings-jpg.webp\" alt=\"ActoFive Factory Tour: CNC-machined aluminum mountain bikes made-in-Germany, alloy metal filings\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_aluminum-filings-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_aluminum-filings-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_aluminum-filings-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_aluminum-filings-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_aluminum-filings-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_aluminum-filings-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides data, Actofive’s factory is covered with these small aluminum filings we saw in our tour. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, the bulk of material gets efficiently collected for recycling, but plenty of chips fly around. That’s why machining happens in its own completely enclosed room. But every time Simon moves around to control the process, filings stick to his clothes &amp; shoes. And since they’re not magnetic, it’s a chore to totally keep under control. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So he has separate clothes and shoes for working on bikes &amp; components in the shop. And just resigns himself to regular cleaning and swapping to separate clothing before leaving the workshop.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_custom-contact-machining-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_custom-contact-machining-jpg.webp\" alt=\"ActoFive Factory Tour: CNC-machined aluminum mountain bikes made-in-Germany, Metzner Engineering contract manufacture\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_custom-contact-machining-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_custom-contact-machining-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_custom-contact-machining-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_custom-contact-machining-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_custom-contact-machining-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, specialized machined alloy components. Actofive is the bike brand that drives Simon Metzner’s passion. And from that we get full-suspension Actofive mountain bike frames, cranksets &amp; chainrings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But he does plenty of contract manufacturing too. There’s certainly a bit of crossover in the bike industry – things like bashguards, top caps, and even some more advanced elements like rocker links &amp; seatstays for other bike companies. But there’s plenty of other industrial machining, too. Simon explained that he spends the vast majority of his development and production time on the Actofive mountain bike side of things, but still more than three-quarters of his profit comes from contract machining.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Actofive Factory Tour: MTB cranks, chainrings &amp;

And they are even offering the custom mk2 I-Train bike in advance, that will be on display in the Dresden Airport show over the weekend. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Anodized eye candy colors</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_colorful-anodizing-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_colorful-anodizing-jpg.webp\" alt=\"ActoFive Factory Tour: CNC-machined aluminum mountain bikes made-in-Germany - purple, silver, grey, blue, red, black\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_colorful-anodizing-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_colorful-anodizing-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_colorful-anodizing-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_colorful-anodizing-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, one of the cool benefits of an all-machined-alloy mountain bike (or components) is the ability for some flashy anodized finishes.

By machining each side individually, Actofive can creates the exact smooth outer shape that they want for the bike, but can vary thicknesses throughout various sections of the frame, much like you find with butted tubing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in reality, the inside of the I-Train is much more complex that that, featuring a series of reinforcing webs that vary the tube wall thickness much more than could be achieved by any tube-to-tube style construction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the real secret comes with the mechanically overlapping finger joint from one side of the frame to the next. This greatly increases the surface contact  area between the two halves, resulting in a strong bond when the frame is assembled with adhesive. And it also reinforces the joint at the top and bottom edges of the frame, protecting it against impact with rocks or other obstacles.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_inside-the-headtube-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_inside-the-headtube-jpg.webp\" alt=\"ActoFive Factory Tour: CNC-machined aluminum mountain bikes made-in-Germany, inside the headtube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_inside-the-headtube-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_inside-the-headtube-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_inside-the-headtube-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_inside-the-headtube-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_inside-the-headtube-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I really love about Actofive’s bikes is how you can see the machining marks that show how the CNC tooling cuts back and forth into the aluminum billet. But of course, since they machine the inside of the frame just as much as the outside, our Actofive factory tour also gave us an up-close glimpse at how those tool paths are even visible inside of the frame. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like on the inside of this I-Train’s headtube.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What comes next for Actofive?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_I-Train-in-red-and-blue-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_I-Train-in-red-and-blue-jpg.webp\" alt=\"ActoFive Factory Tour: CNC-machined aluminum mountain bikes made-in-Germany, red &amp; blue custom\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_I-Train-in-red-and-blue-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_I-Train-in-red-and-blue-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_I-Train-in-red-and-blue-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_I-Train-in-red-and-blue-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_I-Train-in-red-and-blue-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That was pretty much it for our Actofive factory tour. We got to watch some Signature X cranksets be machined – 60 crank arms at a time in that batch. And Simon revealed us a bit of what was coming soon this year. Think UDH compatibility across all frames, of course, including the ability to retrofit all of the frames they had previously produced. And these newly machined, open-back seatstays that replaced the I-Train’s original welded tubing stays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, there’s even more that we will see over the coming seeking with more next-gen P-Train &amp; I-Train updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned for that!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Actofive after dark</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_live-machine-camera-feed-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_live-machine-camera-feed-jpg.webp\" alt=\"ActoFive Factory Tour: CNC-machined aluminum mountain bikes made-in-Germany, remote monitoring\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_live-machine-camera-feed-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_live-machine-camera-feed-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_live-machine-camera-feed-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_live-machine-camera-feed-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_live-machine-camera-feed-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_live-machine-camera-feed-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_live-machine-camera-feed-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, we’ll leave you with Actofive ‘After Dark’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of Actofive’s CNC-machining processes take 8 hours or more to complete. So Simon tries to schedule it so that he can set up a machining task at the end of his workday, to run overnight. And he’ll often even reducing tool speeds a bit to ensure less chance of any trouble when the machines are left to work on their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actofive has a webcam in the machining room so Simon can dial-in to keep tabs on progress – whether he’s upstairs working at his desk on another project, or back home for the night.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_after-dark-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_after-dark-jpg.webp\" alt=\"ActoFive Factory Tour: CNC-machined aluminum mountain bikes made-in-Germany, ActoFive after dark\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_after-dark-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_after-dark-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_after-dark-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_after-dark-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_after-dark-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Actofive-Factory-Tour_how-German-CNC-machined-mountain-bikes-are-made-in-Dresden_after-dark-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And while the lights go out in the human side of the Actofive workshop, the light often stays on all night as the CNC robot chugs away, machining mountain bikes through the lonely night. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://Actofive.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Actofive.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/inside-actofive-factory-tour-german-cnc-machined-mtb-gems-a-closer-look/\">Inside Actofive Factory Tour: German CNC-Machined MTB Gems, A Closer Look</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"f04e539c9a79df0355862adf03960852cb7b099279c846138391a91c4042889e","category":"Cycling"}
