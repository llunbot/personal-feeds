While we all try to avoid them, crashes happen, and a good helmet can help prevent injuries to your head and brain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We rounded up a diverse selection of 15 of the best mountain bike helmets available in 2023 and put them through their paces on a wide range of trail types, riding styles, and weather conditions. From desert XC loops, loamy forest laps, shuttle runs, and gravel rides, we spent ample time riding in each model while assessing key elements of their performance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While testing, we scrutinized important characteristics that matter on the trail like fit, comfort, coverage, visors, ventilation, and durability. We took detailed notes and narrowed down the field to our favorite models and those that excel for specific reasons compared to the rest. Though no single helmet will be perfect for every type of riding or rider, we’re confident you’ll find something to suit your needs and budget. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve listed our top recommendations below, and to compare the models we tested at a glance, check out our <a href=\"#h-comparison-chart\">comparison chart</a>. If you need help deciding what you need, be sure to check out our <a href=\"#buyer-s-guide\">buying advice</a> and <a href=\"#frequently-asked-questions\">FAQ</a> for answers.

href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fgiro-manifest-spherical-helmet\">Manifest Spherical</a>. The well-rounded model quickly earned high regard among our testers and rose to the top of a stacked selection of helmets in this review. </p><p></p><p>Boasting a 5-star rating in Virginia Tech’s independent helmet impact testing, the Manifest brings a high level of protection to the table. It employs MIPS Spherical for rotational impact protection and features dual shells connected with elastomers that function as a slip plane in the event of an impact. It has a relatively deep fit with extended coverage at the back of the head and temples and a snug fit enhanced by Giro’s Roc Loc Trail harness that pulls tension evenly around the head. </p><p></p><p>Ventilation is among the best we tested with a whopping 19 vents and wide open channels that effectively allow air to pass over the scalp and out the back of the helmet. Comfort is enhanced with well-placed antibacterial Ionic+ padding and strap splitters that hold the straps flat around the ears. At 362g (size Medium), it’s also relatively lightweight considering its coverage and goes largely unnoticed out on the trail. </p><p></p><p>Features like an adjustable visor allow you to position it effectively to keep the sun out of your eyes or to stash sunglasses or goggles under it when not in use. Integrated rubber grippers work with most (but not all) sunglasses and an additional patch of grippy rubber at the rear of the helmet helps keep your goggle strap in place. A Fidlock magnetic buckle secures the chinstrap and allows for easy one-handed operation.</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fgiro-manifest-spherical-helmet\">Giro Manifest Spherical</a> comes in a wide range of colors to suit your taste or match your kit, and it is offered in three shell sizes, S, M, and L, to fit heads between 51cm and 63cm. It carries a high price tag, but we feel the cost is justified considering its well-rounded performance, protection, and features. </p><p></p><p>In addition to testing this helmet for this buyer’s

This helmet is easily the best value we’ve ever seen with a look and feel that far exceeds the asking price. In fact, it looks nearly identical to its more expensive siblings, the Ambush 2 and the Tactic. Adding to its appeal is the 5-star rating in Virginia Tech’s independent impact testing, besting many models that cost significantly more. </p><p></p><p>The Camber comes with a standard MIPS liner for rotational impact protection that sits inside the streamlined in-mold shell. It comes in a whopping 5 shell sizes to fit heads ranging from 49 to 63 cm, and our size Large test helmet fits true to size. The Headset SX fit system works well to dial in the fit to your unique head shape, the thin and minimal padding proved to be surprisingly comfortable, and the Y-shaped strap splitter yoke prevents any unwanted and annoying contact with the ears. Though not advertised as a feature, we found that some sunglasses could be stashed in the two lowest vents above the brow.</p><p></p><p>While the price-to-performance ratio of the Camber is very impressive, this helmet does have some quirks. The straps attach at three points inside the helmet at the back of the head and above the temples, and while that doesn’t seem to affect its impact protection, it feels less refined than higher-end helmets. The 13 vents do a decent job of keeping the head cool, but it feels a little stuffy compared to the best-vented helmets we tested. Finally, the non-adjustable visor that’s placed high on the helmet does very little to block low sun angles compared to other visor designs. </p><p></p><p>Still, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-camber-cpsc-helmet\">Specialized Camber</a> truly impressed us for the price and we feel it is a great option for anyone just getting into the sport, those operating on a tight budget, or anyone who appreciates a good value.

Designed for aggressive trail and enduro riders, the Kortal has a deep fit and loads of coverage over the occipital and temporal lobes. It comes packed with safety features integrated into the design including MIPS Integra, an evolution of their previous SPIN system. POC also makes a <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpoc-kortal-helmet\">standard version of the Kortal</a> that doesn’t come with MIPS and will save you a few bucks.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the Kortal Race MIPS is a comfortable helmet, though we found its sizing to run a little bigger than advertised and it is slightly narrower than most. One of our testers has a 59cm head and easily fits into the M-L which is listed as 55-58cm. Regardless, in the correct size, it has a snug fit with a 360° adjustment system that wraps around the whole head with soft and squishy MIPS Integra pads. Ventilation is also top notch with a total of 17 wide open vents that effectively draw air in, over, and away from the head, and the MIPS integrated padding doesn’t restrict any airflow. The strap splitter yoke holds the straps flat against the side of the face with no unwanted ear contact with a simple buckle to secure the chinstrap. </p><p></p><p>The large visor is adjustable to accommodate stashing goggles beneath it and the rear vents have been designed to fit a goggle strap without blocking them. The rear vents also function as an “eye garage” to stash glasses when not in use. While the visor does adjust, we found that its lowest position is already pretty high, and mostly kept it down. The visor also has a highly effective breakaway feature to help reduce the chance of a neck injury in a crash and it easily snaps back into place if/when it comes off. It has an EPS foam lining surrounded by a unibody shell that is reinforced with aramid bridges for additional structural support as well as a RECCO Reflector and a twICEme NFC Medical ID chip. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tool_type=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F203107%2Fpoc-kortal-race-mips-bike-helmet&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet\">Kortal Race MIPS</a> was designed to work seamlessly with POC’s Devour sunglasses, but we found that the extended temporal coverage could conflict with the arms of some other sunglasses. It’s not the lightest helmet around, but it’s pretty reasonable given its protective qualities and features. It carries all the standard safety certifications as well as the Dutch NTA 8776 e-bike standard. It’s not cheap, but we feel the Kortal Race MIPS is among the best and most protective half-shell models on the market.

Though it maintains the signature styling of those older models, the A3 is an improvement in virtually every way. Not only does it feature more coverage at the back of the head and the temples, but it also earned a 5-star safety rating from the independent test lab at Virginia Tech.</p><p></p><p>The A3 has more coverage than previous TLD helmets, extending further over the occipital and temporal lobes. It also comes with a B-Series MIPS liner intended to help dissipate rotational forces in a crash. They’ve also employed dual-density foam with co-molded EPP and EPS intended to better handle the forces of both high and low-speed impacts.</p><p></p><p>What really stood out to our testers was the high level of comfort, as noted by Jessie-May Morgan in her full review of the A3 MIPS. TLD describes it as “so comfortable you’ll never want to take it off”, and while that might be a stretch, it’s definitely one of the most comfortable helmets we’ve tested. This has a lot to do with the agreeable shape of the helmet, the way the fit system wraps around the head, and the generous padding inside. The X-static antimicrobial pads are also trimmable to dial them exactly how you like, plus it comes with an extra set.</p><p></p><p>The ventilation of the A3 MIPS is quite good as well, not the best we’ve ever tested, but not far off either. When things get sweaty, the TLD Sweat Glide System (an EVA foam pad at the brow), actually helps to direct sweat off to the sides of your face instead of into your eyes. The 3-position Magnajust visor allows you to leave it low to block the sun or up out of sight or to stash goggles. A FidLock chinstrap buckle, a set of extra visor screws, and a helmet bag round out the features of the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ftroy-lee-designs-a3-mips-helmet\">Troy Lee Designs A3 MIPS</a>.

This helmet checks all of the boxes, feels light on the head, and virtually disappears while riding. It also manages to come in at a price that’s a little lower than many other brands’ flagship models. </p><p></p><p>Specialized upped the ante of protection with the Ambush 2, and this is evidenced by its 5-star rating in Virginia Tech independent testing. The coverage is impressive with a deep fit that extends way down the back of the head over the occipital lobe. The MIPS SL system is integrated into the pads with little rubber elastomers that allow them to shift to reduce rotational forces in the event of a crash, and dual-density EPS foam has also been strategically placed inside the shell.</p><p></p><p>Comfort levels are high with well-placed padding and an adjustment system that pulls tension very even around the whole head and a low-profile dial that’s integrated into the shell. The padding also manages to effectively wick moisture and help keep sweat out of the eyes and it doesn’t block airflow whatsoever. On that note, the Ambush 2 has some of the best ventilation of any helmet we’ve ever used. The vents at the front of the helmet bring air in and the large internal channels draw it over the head and out to the back. This ventilation is noticeable at any speed and was nearly <em>too effective</em> when riding on cool days. </p><p></p><p>The Tri-Fix strap splitters keep the straps comfortably away from the ears. Goggles play well with the Ambush 2 and there is ample room to stash them below the visor when not in use. The two outer/lower vents at the front of the helmet also feature sunglass storage with rubber flaps that hold sunglass arms very securely when stored. Additionally, a Specialized ANGi crash detection sensor (sold separately) can be added to the helmet if you choose. </p><p></p><p>Our biggest complaint about the Ambush 2 is the high position of the non-adjustable visor which we found to do little to block the sun at low angles. We found you’ve really got to tip your head to keep the sun out of your eyes at certain times of day, which is not ideal. It also has somewhat bold, stormtrooper-esque styling (especially in the white color we tested) which may suit everyone’s tastes.

Chosen by some of the top pros in gravel and XC mountain bike racing, the Aries is a super lightweight and well-ventilated helmet that doesn’t skimp on protection. In fact, it has a 5-star Virginia Tech rating with the lowest score (lower score = better protection) of the 190 models they have tested.</p><p></p><p>The Aries is very lightweight at just 270g in the size Medium we tested. It’s so light that it barely feels like you’re wearing a helmet at all, with an excellent fit with minimal but well-placed padding, and an adjustable harness that wraps tension evenly around the whole head. The <em>Drycore</em> padding above the brow wicks seat effectively and features Ionic+ antimicrobial treatment. It is also one of the best-ventilated helmets we’ve ever used with 24 total vents and massive channels that keep air flowing and your head cool. </p><p></p><p>The Aries uses the same MIPS Spherical design as the trail-oriented Manifest Spherical. This design is comprised of outer and inner shells connected with rubber elastomers that allow them to move independently to help dissipate rotational forces in the event of a crash. Given the Aries’ Virginia Tech rating and score, it seems like it must be pretty effective. </p><p></p><p>Compared to trail or enduro-oriented half-shells, it doesn’t have as much head coverage, but it is comparable to other XC and road helmets. Like other XC helmets, it gives up a visor in favor of aerodynamics and weight savings. It’s also one of the most expensive helmets we’ve tested. That said, if you’re looking for a featherlight and extremely well-ventilated lid for XC racing or cross-country riding, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F219022%2Fgiro-aries-spherical-bike-helmet\">Aries Spherical</a> is an excellent choice that works just as well on the road or gravel bike.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F219022%2Fgiro-aries-spherical-bike-helmet\">Check Price at REI</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BT1X1MFL/?tag=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0421-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0421-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Giro Aries Spherical\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0421-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0421-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0421-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0421-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0421-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0421-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0421-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0421-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>If you like riding in lycra and pushing the pace on your XC or gravel bike, the Aries may be the helmet for you.

This versatile model is used by XC mountain bikers, road, and gravel riders, and it delivers with a super light, 278-gram weight (size medium) and excellent ventilation. Previous versions used SPIN for rotational impact protection, but POC has recently switched to a more standard MIPS liner. </p><p></p><p>Coming in at a feathery 278 grams, the Octal MIPS is so light that it barely feels like it’s on your head. The fit harness is highly adjustable to properly cradle the occipital lobe, plus it wraps the whole head for a snug, secure, and comfortable fit. Factor in the impressive cooling properties of the recognizable ventilation design with 21 vents and deep airflow channels, and it’s easy to stay cool on hot days and during hard efforts. The strap splitter also does a great job of keeping the straps flat and away from the ears and the chinstrap is secured with a standard buckle.</p><p></p><p>POC designed the Octal to be lightweight and airy, but they still prioritize protection. A fully wrapped unibody shell protects the EPS foam lining and gives it structural support, and the EPS has been optimized to handle impacts with added thickness in important zones. The MIPS liner is relatively standard and intends to help dissipate rotational forces in the event of a crash. </p><p></p><p>Much like other XC-style helmets, the Octal leaves more of the head exposed compared to modern trail-riding helmets. It comes in three shell sizes to fit heads between 50 and 61cm. Our size medium claims to fit heads between 54-60cm. Our tester with a size 59cm head is near the upper end of that range and found the fit to be manageable, but tighter than expected. This is in contrast to the Kortal Race MIPS, which we found tends to run a little larger than advertised.</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpoc-octal-mips-helmet\">POC Octal MIPS</a> sells for $200 and costs a fair bit less than the Giro Aries, yet it only weighs a paltry 8 grams more. We think this helmet is an excellent choice for XC-style riders looking for a lightweight and breathable lid for riding or racing.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpoc-octal-mips-helmet\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NZWB7CF/?tag=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0482-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0482-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"POC Octal MIPS\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0482-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0482-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0482-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0482-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0482-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0482-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0482-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0482-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The POC Octal combines an impressively low weight with excellent ventilation to make it a great XC helmet.

Designed with the modern trail and enduro rider in mind, this helmet has a deep fit with loads of head coverage and a robust, quality feel. It also happens to look pretty darn good, and it retails for less than many other brands’ flagship models. It comes in three shell sizes to fit heads between 51 and 61cm, and multiple colorways to suit your tastes.</p><p></p><p>ABUS didn’t skimp when it came to coverage, and the CliffHanger certainly covers a lot of your head. The shell sits fairly low over the brow, temples, and ears, and the rear extends way down over the occipital lobe and behind the ears. They incorporated ActiCage into the EPS foam, a system that is intended to provide structural reinforcement and strength while allowing them to limit the amount of material and weight. On the topic of weight, our large test helmet tipped our scales at 423g, fairly standard for its size and level of coverage. Inside there is a relatively standard MIPS liner for rotational impact protection. It’s also compatible with QUIN, a crash-detection sensor,  that can be purchased separately and added to the helmet.</p><p></p><p>ABUS’s Zoom Ace adjustment system is incorporated into the MIPS liner and pulls even tension around the whole head, plus it can be moved up or down to find the perfect placement at the back of the skull. The fixed strap splitter yoke holds them flat and away from the ears and the magnetic chinstrap buckle makes for one-handed buckling convenience. The large, 3-position adjustable visor works very effectively for keeping the sun out of your eyes, and it flips up plenty high to stash goggles when not in use. Ventilation is pretty good, but not amazing, with a total of 14 vents and deep channels that allow air to pass from front to back.</p><p></p><p>We found the overall comfort of the CliffHanger to be quite good, although our lead tester found that he could feel the shell pressing slightly against the top/back of the crown of his head. Fit and comfort will be different for everyone, however, so we don’t expect this to be an issue for all users Unlike many helmets that have dedicated sunglass storage, we found it somewhat difficult to stash sunglasses securely in the front vents. You can make it work, but it isn’t ideal.

This beefy helmet is also the basis of the convertible Super Air R Spherical, just without the removable chin bar. It has great coverage, a robust, protective feel, and features like MIPS Spherical, a camera mount, and an effective sweat management system that makes it stand out from the crowd. It comes in three sizes for heads between 52 and 62cm and is offered in a whopping 11 different color options.</p><p></p><p>Bell and Giro are two brands that incorporate MIPS Spherical into their designs for rotational impact protection. For the Super Air, this involves two distinct shells, inner and outer, that are connected with small elastomers that allow them to shift independently of each other. This adds a little bulk and weight, but it does seem to work quite effectively (at least in hand and when moving it atop the head). The deep fit surrounds the head with great coverage, particularly at the back of the head. It also just feels beefy and well-made, adding to the sense of protection it provides.</p><p></p><p>We found it to be quite comfortable with generous padding throughout that has a soft, pillowy feel. Bell’s Float fit system does a fine job of fine-tuning the tension around the head to achieve a snug fit. Bell has also managed to create a sweat management system that actually works with their Sweat Guide Pad. The padding extends slightly forward on the inner shell where it draws moisture out and away from the face, making it less likely to drip directly onto your sunglass lenses. The Super Air has a large 3-position visor, and it works well with goggles and even has a small rubber patch at the rear of the helmet to keep your goggle strap in place. The front vents easily accommodate sunglass arms, but they don’t feature grippers or anything to add extra security.</p><p></p><p>The Super Air Spherical has decent ventilation, but the dual-shell design hinders airflow a little compared to other models. At 478g, it’s also the heaviest half-shell model we tested by a significant margin, and the weight is somewhat noticeable on the head. That said, it is designed to pair with a removable chin bar to work as a convertible full face, so the added heft makes sense. Regardless, if you’re an aggressive rider seeking a fully featured half-shell and don’t mind a little extra weight, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fbell-super-air-mips-helmet\">Bell Super Air Spherical</a> is a solid option to consider.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fbell-super-air-mips-helmet\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DVG9WBD/?tag=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F169940%2Fbontrager-rally-wavecel-mountain-bike-helmet\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBontrager Rally WaveCel\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$160</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>420g (L)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rotational Impact Protection System</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>WaveCel</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Adjustable Visor</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Number of Vents</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>13</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>S, M, L, XL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Virginia Tech Helmet Safety Rating</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>5-star</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bontrager-Rally-WaveCel.jpeg\">\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1275\" height=\"850\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bontrager-Rally-WaveCel.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Helmets of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bontrager-Rally-WaveCel.jpeg 1275w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bontrager-Rally-WaveCel-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bontrager-Rally-WaveCel-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bontrager-Rally-WaveCel-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bontrager-Rally-WaveCel-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bontrager-Rally-WaveCel-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Moderate price point</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Comfortable fit</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Boa adjustment system</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Scores better in Virginia Tech testing than the more expensive Bontrager Blaze</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Straps could be improved</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>WaveCel adds bulk</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Doesn’t have the best ventilation</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Bontrager made waves (pun intended) a few years ago when they introduced a new rotational impact protection system called WaveCel. They incorporated it into a number of their cycling helmets including the half-shell mountain bike helmet, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F169940%2Fbontrager-rally-wavecel-mountain-bike-helmet\">Rally WaveCel</a>. The brand makes some pretty big claims about the effectiveness of this system, and given its 5-star rating in Virginia Tech’s impact testing, it seems like it must be relatively effective. Otherwise, this mid-priced model has a relatively traditional style and it comes in 4 shell sizes. The XL size is claimed to fit heads all the way up to 66cm, which is significantly larger than 62 or 63cm where most other models max out.</p><p></p><p>WaveCel is the primary thing that sets the Rally apart from the other helmets we’ve tested. This cellular structure resembles a bunch of tightly packed waves and it comprises the majority of the inside of the helmet, surrounded by a thinner outer shell of EPS foam. According to Bontrager, WaveCel is designed to function in three steps, flex, crumple, and glide. So, it is intended to absorb impact force like a more traditional foam lining while also functioning as a slip-plane for the reduction of rotational forces. At the same time, it allows air to pass through, so it remains breathable despite the full head coverage. </p><p></p><p>We found the Rally to have a very comfortable fit that seems like it should work well for most head shapes. The Boa adjustment system works well to snug it up around the head, and the thin Boa wires don’t conflict with sunglass arms as much as some other systems. The adjustable visor has three positions, one of which is very low, and we kept ours in the middle or all the way up while testing. The highest visor position doesn’t allow enough space for stashing goggles, but we were able to wedge our sunglass arms into the front vents under the visor.</p><p></p><p>While WaveCel is certainly an interesting feature, it does add a little weight and bulk to the Rally and it is generally just a bit larger overall than most of the other models we tested. The cellular structure does allow air to pass through, but it does inhibit the flow of air somewhat. It is similar to the Smith Forefront 2 in this regard, where the airflow is okay, but far from the best. We also found the strap design to be a little quirky, as the single attachment point at the back of the head required a little extra care to be taken when donning the helmet so they didn’t hang up on the adjustment harness. </p><p></p><p>Beyond that, we feel the <a

href=\"https://smithoptics.pxf.io/c/2227671/1154578/14604?subId1=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smithoptics.com%2Fen_US%2Fp%2Fhelmet%2Fforefront-2-mips-mtb-helmet%2FE007220WP5155.html\">Forefront 2</a> is the latest version of this popular trail riding model. It has some of the most recognizable styling of any helmet on the market with unique looks and visible Koroyd in its construction. Beyond its futuristic appearance, Smith set out to make a highly protective helmet, and their use of Koroyd sets them apart from most other brands on the market. The Forefront 2 is offered in 14 different colors and three shell sizes for heads ranging from 51cm to 62 cm.</p><p></p><p>Smith’s use of Koroyd is the main thing that differentiates the Forefront 2 from other helmets on the market. This honeycomb-like material is designed to crumple on impact while remaining air-permeable, therefore providing protection <em>and</em> allowing heat and moisture to escape from the head. The majority of the helmet has a layer of Koroyd that is bordered by and then covered with a thin layer of EPS foam and the helmet’s outer shell. Inside, there is a relatively standard MIPS liner for rotational impact protection. The level of coverage is quite good, although slightly less than some other models in this review.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the original Forefront, the Forefront 2 has a couple of wide-open vents on top of the head that improve its ventilation slightly. The minimal but well-placed padding combines with the adjustable Vaporfit harness system for a snug and comfortable fit. The three-position adjustable visor works well for blocking the sun, and it shifts high enough to fit goggles when not in use. Smith also designed the helmet to hold sunglasses securely on top with the Koroyd providing the grip on the sunglass arms. </p><p></p><p>While the ventilation of the Forefront 2 is better than its predecessor, it still can’t compete with the airiest helmets on the market. The Koroyd simply doesn’t allow for air to move that freely from front to back. The MIPS liner can also be a little squeaky at times, which can be a little annoying. </p><p></p><p>Regardless, the <a href=\"https://smithoptics.pxf.io/c/2227671/1154578/14604?subId1=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smithoptics.com%2Fen_US%2Fp%2Fhelmet%2Fforefront-2-mips-mtb-helmet%2FE007220WP5155.html\">Smith Forefront 2</a> is a great trail-riding helmet that will suit many riders’ needs perfectly. While it may not be for everybody, we love the unique style. Our lead tester has been riding in the same one for the past two years, and it’s still going strong. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://smithoptics.pxf.io/c/2227671/1154578/14604?subId1=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smithoptics.com%2Fen_US%2Fp%2Fhelmet%2Fforefront-2-mips-mtb-helmet%2FE007220WP5155.html\">Check Price at Smith Optics</a><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F128931%2Fsmith-forefront-2-mips-bike-helmet\">Check Price at REI</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F213329%2Ffox-speedframe-pro-mips-bike-helmet\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFox Speedframe Pro\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$190</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>408g (L)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rotational Impact Protection System</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>MIPS</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Adjustable Visor</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Number of Vents</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>21</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>S, M, L</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Virginia Tech Helmet Safety Rating</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>5-star</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Fox-Speedframe-Pro.jpeg\">\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"619\" height=\"464\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Fox-Speedframe-Pro.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Helmets of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Fox-Speedframe-Pro.jpeg 619w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Fox-Speedframe-Pro-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Fox-Speedframe-Pro-120x90.jpeg 120w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Feature packed design</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Comfortable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Good looking</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>5-star Virginia Tech rating</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Good coverage</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Some noise from MIPS liner</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Fox Racing is one of only a few brands that can outfit riders from head to toe with everything they could possibly need for mountain biking. They’ve been making helmets for years, but it wasn’t until they launched the<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F213329%2Ffox-speedframe-pro-mips-bike-helmet\"> Speedframe Pro</a> a few years ago that they had a contender for the best half-shell model on the market. This uniquely styled helmet is not only good looking, but it checks all the boxes and comes with all the features you’d expect in a modern trail riding helmet. It comes in numerous colorways so you can be sure to find one that suits your taste, and they also sell the Speedframe without a MIPS liner for $140. </p><p></p><p>The Speedframe Pro comes packed with protective features in an effort to keep your head safe, and it earned a 5-star rating in Virgina Tech’s impact testing. It has extended coverage over the temples and down around the back of the head, with a MIPS liner for rotational impact protection. The outer shell completely wraps around the edges of the Varizorb dual-density EPS foam, which is intended to better manage the forces from high and low-speed impacts than single-density foam. </p><p></p><p>We found it to fit comfortably, and the 360-degree adjustment system snugged it up securely all the way around the head and we didn’t encounter any pressure points of any kind. The straps are well executed with a Y-shaped yoke around the ears that holds them nice and flat and away from the lobes. The Fidlock SNAP buckle makes the chinstrap a “snap” to open and close, even one-handed. The 3-position adjustable visor is great, and it flips up high enough to store goggles on the climbs.

This affordable helmet comes in at the lower end of the price range of the models we tested, with a retail price of just $125. We think the Altis looks great, and it has some interesting features like 100%’s proprietary impact protection system called SmartShock. It comes in three sizes for heads ranging between 50 to 63cm, and several color options. The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2F100-altis-gravel-helmet\">Altis Gravel</a> is essentially the same helmet, just without the visor. </p><p></p><p>The Altis has pretty good head coverage, though just slightly less than some of the other models in this regard. The EPS foam is in-molded to the polycarbonate outer shell with the lower edges fully wrapped for durability. Inside, 100% has developed the SmartShock system to help mitigate rotational impact forces. This consists of 11 blue rubber elastomers that protrude out from small depressions in the EPS foam and through holes in the liner pads. They essentially suspend the helmet around your head and serve the purpose of absorbing some direct impact while having the ability to shift slightly in any direction. How well this works compared to MIPS isn’t exactly clear, but when you shift them around with your fingers or wiggle the helmet around on your head, they seem like they work as intended. </p><p></p><p>The adjustment harness works well enough to snug the helmet around your head, though it lacks any vertical adjustability. The fixed, Y-shaped strap splitters work well to keep them away from your ears, and the chinstrap has adequate adjustability and a standard buckle. While we found the Altis to be generally comfortable, we did note one distinct pressure point where one of the SmartShock elastomers pressed into our tester’s forehead. He does have a particularly prominent forehead, however, so this may not be an issue for all users. With 14 vents, the ventilation is relatively good, but the general lack of internal channels doesn’t allow air to move quite as well as the breeziest models out there. </p><p></p><p>100% wanted to make sure the Altis worked with goggles, and the visor flips way up and out of the way in its highest position to accommodate them. We did not, however, find a good way to store glasses on the head, other than keeping them on your face. At 383g, our size large test helmet is relatively lightweight in its class. We also happen to like the way this helmet looks, especially when paired with some big ol’ 100% riding glasses. If you dig the style and don’t want to spend a lot on a quality trail-riding helmet, we think the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2F100-altis-helmet\">100% Altis</a> is worthy of consideration.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2F100-altis-helmet\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F203168%2Flazer-jackal-kineticore-bike-helmet\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLazer Jackal KinetiCore\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$220</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>345g (L)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rotational Impact Protection System</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>KinetiCore</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Adjustable Visor</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Number of Vents</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>19</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>S, M, L</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Virginia Tech Helmet Safety Rating</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>5-star</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Lazer-Jackal-Kineticore.jpeg\">\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"705\" height=\"470\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Lazer-Jackal-Kineticore.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Helmets of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Lazer-Jackal-Kineticore.jpeg 705w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Lazer-Jackal-Kineticore-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Lazer-Jackal-Kineticore-120x80.jpeg 120w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lightweight</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Well-ventilated</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Good coverage</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Comes with camera mount</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Works with removable rear light (sold separately)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Experienced some pressure points on the head</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Lazer is one of several brands that’s making an effort to reinvent rotational impact protection through new designs with KinetiCore. They’ve implemented this design across many of their mountain and road helmets, including their flagship mountain bike half-shell, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F203168%2Flazer-jackal-kineticore-bike-helmet\">Lazer Jackal KinetiCore</a>. Though it looks identical to the previous version with MIPS, it’s a bit lighter weight, and what’s going on inside the helmet is actually quite a bit different. </p><p></p><p>The easiest thing for most brands to do is just stick a MIPS liner in their helmets, so we applaud Lazer for stepping outside the box and developing their own new safety technology. KinetiCore is intended to work in a similar way to other rotational impact protection systems, though the design is completely different. Instead of a liner or elastomers, they have essentially incorporated it into the shell itself with controlled crumple zones built into the EPS foam. These small, isolated blocks of foam are intended to crush and crumple both vertically and laterally in the event of an impact. Our tester even crushed some of them with her hand to see how it in action. New technology is great if it works, and it seems like it does based on the Jackal KinetiCore’s 5-star Virginia Tech rating.</p><p></p><p>Beyond KinetiCore, the Jackal has a modern shape with ample coverage. It has great ventilation with 19 well-placed vents, and the air is able to pass through the empty space between the KinetiCore blocks. The one-piece interior padding is comfortable and treated with Polygiene Biostatic, and the Advanced TurnSys adjustment system provides a secure fit. The straps are highly adjustable and the magnetic buckle makes for easy one-handed operation. It also comes with a camera mount that attaches to the top of the helmet with a velcro strap, and Lazer’s Universal LED light can be mounted to the back of the helmet for enhanced visibility. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F203168%2Flazer-jackal-kineticore-bike-helmet\">Lazer Jackal KinetiCore</a> has an adjustable visor that is designed to stow goggles when not in use and it has no problem accommodating them when flipped up in its highest position. At the back of the helmet, a rubber goggle grip pad keeps your strap securely in place. By the temples, they’ve specifically shaped the shell with recesses to prevent sunglass arms from making contact. Our only real gripe with the Jackal KinetiCore is that our tester had some pressure points from the adjustment system. The preproduction sample she tested also had an issue that has since been resolved.

Unlike the futuristic Forefront 2, the Engage 2 has a more traditional look with significantly less Koroyd in its design, and it costs less than half the price. Still, it has everything we look for in a modern half-shell helmet with a look and feel that exceeds the asking price. It comes in 4 shell sizes to fit heads between 51 and 65cm, and six color options including the Matte Slate/Fools Gold we tested.</p><p></p><p>The shell has a fairly deep fit with good coverage at the sides and back of the head. The polycarbonate shell wraps all the way around the EPS foam, and there are two strips of Koroyd strategically placed on the sides of the helmet. Smith incorporated a MIPS Evolve Core liner for rotational impact protection, and the Vaporfit harness connects to it for a nice 360-degree adjustment system. It has a well-made feel and the judicious use of Koroyd isn’t a negative, in our opinion. </p><p></p><p>Less Koroyd in the construction means that more of the vents are wide-open, and the Engage 2’s ventilation is quite good. The 21 vents allow plenty of air to pass through with the 4 at the front providing a nice breeze at the top of the forehead. It has an agreeable shape that should work for most heads and we never experienced any pressure points or quirks in the fit. The padding is minimal but well-placed, adding to the comfort.</p><p></p><p>The visor is adjustable with three positions to suit your needs. The highest position makes it possible to fit goggles when not in use or stash some sunglasses. You can squeeze some sunglass arms into the outermost front vents as well, although we found this didn’t work with all the sunglasses we tried.  The straps offer plenty of adjustability at the ears and the chin, but we found it difficult to get the splitter to make the straps sit completely flat by the ears. </p><p></p><p>Regardless, we feel

For that reason, a quality helmet is the most important piece of gear we put on before every mountain bike ride. We’re always seeking the most protective, comfortable, and best-looking mountain bike helmets we can find so we can have fun on the trails with the peace of mind a good helmet provides. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our editorial staff has been testing the latest and greatest mountain bike helmets for over a decade. Sure, we’ve all got our favorites, but the market is ever-changing with new and updated models coming out all the time. Fortunately, we get to try them all out, often before they are even available to the public. This experience has given us unique insight as to what makes a great helmet, along with the ability to discern the differences in performance and functionality between the different models we test. If you’re a roadie, our team has also thoroughly tested and reviewed the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-helmets/\">best road bike helmets</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review author, Jeremy Benson, has been professionally testing and reviewing mountain bikes and accessories for 6+ years. In that time, he has tried over 30 different helmets. Whether for XC rides, shuttle laps, or adventurous backcountry loops, he has honed in on the specific performance attributes that make a great helmet. For the purposes of this review, he tested 10 models side by side to directly compare things like fit, comfort, ventilation, coverage, and visors. Those findings, combined with models our editors have recently tested, are presented here to help inform your important mountain bike helmet purchase decision. In addition to helmets, Jeremy has also tested and reviewed <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-sunglasses/\">the best cycling sunglasses</a> to keep your eyes protected while you ride, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-shoes/\">clipless mountain bike shoes</a>, and our <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-shorts/\">favorite mountain bike shorts</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0635-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0635-scaled.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0635-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0635-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0635-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0635-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0635-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0635-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0635-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0635-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Getting a helmet that suits your riding style, fits right, and meets your budget can be tricky, but we’re here to help.

Here we break down some important factors that may help with finding the right model to suit your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Different Types of Mountain Bike Helmets</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As there are several styles of mountain biking, there are just as many helmets to meet the needs of different riders. As the sport has evolved, so too has the protective equipment we use, and these days, helmets are safer than ever. In general, mountain bike helmets fall into three different categories and we explain the differences below. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0611-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0611-scaled.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0611-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0611-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0611-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0611-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0611-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0611-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0611-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0611-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Half-shell helmets for trail riding have evolved over time and provide lots of head coverage and safety features to protect modern trail riders.

These “open-face” models cover the top of the head with modern shell designs offering extended coverage on the back and side of the head to better protect the occipital and temporal lobes. These helmets almost always have a visor (peak), and many are designed to work with both sunglasses and goggles. The added materials involved with extended coverage, visors, and other features typically result in helmets that are slightly heavier than their XC-oriented counterparts. Examples of modern trail riding helmets include the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tool_type=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F203107%2Fpoc-kortal-race-mips-bike-helmet&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet\">POC Kortal Race MIPS</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ftroy-lee-designs-a3-mips-helmet\">Troy Lee Designs A3 MIPS</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-ambush-ii-cpsc-helmet\">Specialized Ambush 2</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0557-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0557-scaled.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0557-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0557-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0557-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0557-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0557-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0557-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0557-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0557-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>XC helmets are typically lighter, well-ventilated, have less coverage, and no visor.

In fact, most professional XC racers are using what are technically considered road bike helmets. This style of helmet is typically sleek, low-profile, and well-ventilated, and they provide a bit less coverage of the head than the extended coverage models. They also generally do not come with a visor, although some riders will wear a cycling cap underneath to act as a visor in certain conditions. Examples include the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F219022%2Fgiro-aries-spherical-bike-helmet\">Giro Aries</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpoc-octal-mips-helmet\">POC Octal MIPS</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/specialized-gambit-dh-helmet-review-smith-squad-goggle-compatible.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/specialized-gambit-dh-helmet-review-smith-squad-goggle-compatible.jpg\" alt=\"specialized gambit helmet review smith squad goggle compatible\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/specialized-gambit-dh-helmet-review-smith-squad-goggle-compatible.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/specialized-gambit-dh-helmet-review-smith-squad-goggle-compatible-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/specialized-gambit-dh-helmet-review-smith-squad-goggle-compatible-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/specialized-gambit-dh-helmet-review-smith-squad-goggle-compatible-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/specialized-gambit-dh-helmet-review-smith-squad-goggle-compatible-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/specialized-gambit-dh-helmet-review-smith-squad-goggle-compatible-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/specialized-gambit-dh-helmet-review-smith-squad-goggle-compatible-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Full-face helmets have traditionally been worn in gravity disciplines, but a new breed of lightweight options is expanding their appeal. (photo: Ellie Lawton)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Full Face and Convertible Helmets</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Full-face helmets provide the most head protection with shells that extend over the ears and large chin bars that provide protection for the front of the face. Convertible helmets are those that have a removable chin bar, allowing the user to choose when they want half-shell or full-face coverage. This style of helmet has traditionally been worn by those in gravity-oriented disciplines like downhill and enduro racing, although a new breed of lightweight and well-ventilated models has expanded their appeal to a broader range of users. Full-face models now come in a range of designs, styles, materials, and weights, with models geared toward virtually every type of rider or protective needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Getting the Right Fit</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A properly fitting helmet is critical for it to not only be comfortable but to work properly in the event of a crash. If it is too loose or too tight, its protective qualities may be compromised or its protective features may not function properly. Additionally, a properly fitting helmet is more comfortable, allowing you to focus your attention on the trail ahead. It is important to note that fit and comfort are subjective, and not every individual’s head shape will work with every helmet. If your head is very round, very narrow, or your forehead very pronounced, you will probably want to try a helmet on before buying it to ensure that it fits your specific head shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0772-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0772-800x533.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0772-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0772-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0772-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0772-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0772-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0772-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0772-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>If you don’t know what size you need, measure your head. 60cm usually falls into a size Large fit range, though it varies a bit by brand. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Sizing</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like people’s heads, most helmets come in multiple sizes. Helmet manufacturers almost always have a size guide on their website for reference. Each helmet size typically fits a small range of head sizes, and these are usually shown as head circumference in centimeter measurements. As a general rule, the best way to determine if a helmet fits is to try it on before you buy. This will ensure you get the proper fit the first time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are unsure of your head’s size, all you need to do is measure it. A flexible measuring tape is the best tool to do this, otherwise, a length of string and a ruler will also do the trick. Measure the circumference of your head in a circle above the eyebrows, ears, and across the occipital lobe (back of the skull). Record this measurement in centimeters, and you should be able to identify the appropriate size helmet. Most adult helmets come in several sizes to cover heads ranging from 51-63cm in circumference (give or take), with each shell size covering a smaller range. For example, the Giro Manifest Spherical comes in three shell sizes: S: 51-55cm, M: 55-59cm, and L: 59-63cm. Most people will fall within one of these sizes. If you are on the cusp between sizes, it is typically better to size up than squeeze into the smaller shell size, in our experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you get a helmet that is too tight or too loose, try and exchange it for the correct size before you wear it and get it sweaty or dirty.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0616-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0616-800x533.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0616-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0616-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0616-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0616-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0616-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0616-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0616-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Adjustable harness systems allow the user to fine-tune the fit of the helmet with the turn of a dial. (photo: Heather Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Fit Adjustments</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Most quality helmets have fit adjustment systems to help you dial them in to your exact head shape to keep them stable, secure, and comfortable when in use. An adjustable harness is one such feature that is used to snug the helmet up against the occipital lobe/back of the skull. These harnesses usually have a small dial that you can turn to tighten or loosen it, and most have a vertical adjustment inside the helmet so you can be sure to position the harness properly under the occipital lobe as well. When tightened properly, the harness should feel snug but not uncomfortable and it should keep your helmet from bouncing around as you ride over rough terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, the chin strap is another important adjustment that helps to keep your helmet on your head in the event of a crash. Too tight and it can be uncomfortable. Too loose and your helmet can come off your head. Most chin straps can be tightened or loosened to fit your specific needs, and this adjustment is quick and easy to make. A general rule of thumb is to be able to fit a finger or two between the strap and your neck for it to be tight enough while still avoiding irritation. The straps should also split <em>around</em> the ears, and we prefer them not to touch our ears at all, if possible. Many strap splitters allow for some adjustment, so you can fit them to your ears for comfort. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Wear it Correctly</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you get a helmet that is the right size, it is important to wear it properly for it to work as intended. Modern helmets are designed to be worn level on the head and snug enough so that they don’t move around. Most of your forehead and the crown of your head should be <em>inside</em> the helmet, as opposed to the helmet sitting up too high or off the back.   </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0164-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0164-1-scaled.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0164-1-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0164-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0164-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0164-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0164-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0164-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0164-1-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0164-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Getting a helmet that fits well and wearing it properly are critical for your comfort and protection.

At the most basic level, mountain bike helmets are comprised of two parts, an inner foam layer (usually EPS foam) and an outer polycarbonate shell. Combined, these layers provide a protective layer that takes the brunt of an impact. The firmer outer shell performs the important task of protecting the softer foam underneath, and when impacted, helps to spread the force of the impact over a greater area. The softer EPS foam compresses and absorbs those forces and it often crushes, cracks, or deforms in the process. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Always Replace Your Helmet After a Crash</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the fact that helmets are designed to partially destruct when absorbing the forces of an impact, they are meant to be replaced after a crash. Often, cracks or other signs of damage will be obvious, but not always. Even low-speed impacts can result in damage that can compromise the integrity and protective qualities of a mountain bike helmet. For your safety, it is recommended that you always replace your helmet after a crash. Thankfully, many brands offer discounts for crash-replacement helmets.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9932-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9932-800x533.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9932-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9932-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9932-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9932-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9932-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9932-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9932-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>MIPS now comes in many forms, although the main idea is the same, to provide a slip-plane to reduce the rotational forces that reach the brain. It often looks like this thin yellow liner inside the POC Octal MIPS. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rotational Impact Protection</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the introduction of MIPS (Multi-Directional Impact Protection System) several years ago, rotational impact protection has become commonplace in mountain bike helmets. MIPS was the originator and is still the most common, although it has developed over the years into numerous iterations, such as MIPS SL, MIPS Evolve, MIPS Spherical, and MIPS Integra, to name a few. The basic idea, however, remains the same. MIPS and similar technologies strive to enhance head protection by reducing the rotational forces that reach the brain during certain impacts. They do this by creating a slip-plane that allows the helmet to shift around the head and absorb some of those forces before they reach the brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many other brands have also developed their own rotational impact protection systems that are intended to work much the same as MIPS. 100%’s SmartShock system, used in the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2F100-altis-helmet\">100% Altis</a>, relies on small rubber elastomers built into the shell that are intended to absorb both rotational and direct impact, and Leatt’s Turbine 360 works similarly. Bontrager’s WaveCel design features a zig-zag honeycomb-like structure that is intended to crumple and shear on impact and KinetiCore was developed by Lazer to work in much the same way, with isolated columns of EPS foam. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9928-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9928-800x533.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9928-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9928-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9928-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9928-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9928-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9928-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9928-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Some brands use Koroyd, the honeycomb-like structure shown here in the Smith Forefront 2, in the construction of their helmets, along with a MIPS liner. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Which one of these technologies works the best is hard to say, but we’re glad that helmet manufacturers are trying to improve helmet safety. At Bikerumor, we don’t have our own impact testing equipment, so we refer to <a href=\"https://www.helmet.beam.vt.edu/bicycle-helmet-ratings.html\">Virginia Tech’s Bicycle Helmet Ratings</a> for more insight. For years, Virginia Tech has been a leader in helmet impact testing, and they do it independently and provide their findings free to the public. They test each helmet for its ability to reduce linear acceleration and rotational velocity with 24 different tests. Of course, they haven’t tested every model on the market, but they do have 190 models of cycling helmets currently tested and rated on their site. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0575-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0575-scaled.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0575-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0575-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0575-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0575-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0575-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0575-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0575-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0575-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Modern helmets, like the ABUS CliffHanger, provide lots of head coverage with shells that extend further down the sides and back of the head. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Coverage</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As mountain bike helmets have evolved over time, the amount of head coverage has increased. For half-shell models like those reviewed here, this is most noticeable on the sides and back of the head where the shells drop down further to better protect the sensitive temporal and occipital lobes. This is particularly apparent in trail, all-mountain, and enduro-oriented models that are often referred to as “extended coverage” half-shell helmets. Unlike old-school helmets that sat high atop the head, modern helmets now surround much more of the skull. Models like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BKJWCL91/brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet-20\">Abus Cliffhanger</a>, <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tool_type=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F203107%2Fpoc-kortal-race-mips-bike-helmet&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet\">POC Kortal Race MIPS</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-ambush-ii-cpsc-helmet\">Specialized Ambush 2</a> are great examples of this trend. In general, we typically equate more head coverage with better head protection, and we feel this is a welcome advancement.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9931-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9931-800x533.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9931-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9931-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9931-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9931-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9931-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9931-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9931-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Ventilation is more than just the number and size of the vents. Good designs allow for air to flow over the head and allow heat and moisture to escape. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ventilation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the climate where you live and ride and how much you sweat, ventilation may or may not be a high priority. For those who live in warm climates, ride in the heat of the day, or simply perspire a lot, how well a helmet allows air to pass through to cool the head may be of the utmost importance. Not only does good ventilation reduce the amount of sweat running down your face or dripping onto your lenses, but it helps to keep you from overheating. Fortunately, most helmet manufacturers do their best to make their helmets well-ventilated, though they are not created equal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While important, the number of vents is not the only factor when it comes to ventilation. Instead, a well-executed design that involves adequate air intake vents at the front of the head, internal channels that move air over the head, and exhaust vents at the back of the head for air to escape is generally the most effective. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0217-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0217-scaled.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0217-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0217-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0217-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0217-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0217-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0217-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0217-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0217-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Most trail helmets have visors, like on the Abus CliffHanger shown here, which help keep the sun out of your eyes and add a little protection from branches and weather. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Visors</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Visors, sometimes referred to as “peaks”, are a common feature on most mountain bike helmets and they serve several purposes. Many visors are adjustable, allowing the rider to position them at various angles. This makes it possible to drop them down low to help keep the sun out of the eyes at low sun angles or move them up and out of the field of view at high sun angles. They also serve to deflect trailside branches and can help keep light rain from reaching the eyes while riding. Adjustable visors and those positioned higher on the helmet typically also accommodate a pair of goggles or sunglasses stashed beneath them when not in use. Some visors are also designed to break away in the event of a crash to reduce the chance of injury.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0757-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0757-800x533.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0757-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0757-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0757-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0757-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0757-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0757-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0757-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Many helmets have special features designed to store eyewear when not in use. The front events of the Specialized Ambush 2 have rubber flaps that effectively grip your sunglass arms to hold them in place. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Eyewear Compatibility</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since most of us wear <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-sunglasses/\">cycling sunglasses</a> to protect our eyes while we ride, many helmet manufacturers are designing and marketing their helmets with integrated sunglass storage and goggle compatibility. It has long been the case that you could wear goggles with many helmets and stash sunglasses in the front vents, but now, these features are often a part of the design. The spacing of the front vents is pretty critical for stowing sunglasses, and some manufacturers have taken to adding rubber grips or other materials to better hold sunglass arms. At the rear of the helmet, many now feature a rubber strip or pad of some kind to add grip for a goggle strap. As mentioned above, visor adjustability or placement is also a factor when stowing either sunglasses or goggles when not in use. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0566-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0566-800x533.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0566-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0566-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0566-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0566-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0566-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0566-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0566-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Brands like Specialized and ABUS are making their helmets compatible with safety tech like the ANGi and QUIN crash detection sensors. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Additional Safety Features</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole point of making helmets for cyclists is to help prevent injury, and manufacturers are seeking additional ways to protect the people who buy their products. They do this in a variety of ways, including the implementation of new technologies. Brands like Specialized and ABUS make small crash detection sensors, called ANGi and QUIN, respectively, that can be attached to the helmet. These small units can sense the forces associated with a crash and send a notification to your contacts in an emergency situation. POC includes a twICEme NFC medical id chip in certain helmets, which can be read by first responders to find out important personal, medical, and contact information if the individual is unresponsive or unable to communicate effectively. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned in the visors section above, some models have visors that are designed to break away in the event of a crash which may help reduce the chance of injury. Other brands use structural reinforcement in their designs with things like <em>aramid bridges</em> or <em>ActiCage</em> integrated into the EPS foam to add strength. The foam itself can be varied with some companies using dual-density foams like EPS and EPP which absorb the energy from high and low-speed impacts differently. Koroyd is another interesting material used by brands like Smith and Endura. This honeycomb-like structure is intended to crush and crumple on impact while remaining porous and allowing air to pass through and heat and moisture to escape. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0750-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0750-1-800x533.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0750-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0750-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0750-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0750-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0750-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0750-1-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0750-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Exposed foam can be easily damaged, so most quality helmets have shells that wrap around the lower edge, improving durability compared to older models. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Durability</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless you crash often or are careless with your gear, helmets tend to have a pretty good lifespan. Quality helmets have in-mold constructions with the inner foam well bonded to the outer shell, and most now have full shell coverage over the lower edge of the foam. Exposed foam is more susceptible to damage, so the more it is covered, the better. The durability of the outer shells of helmets can vary, however, with some being quite resilient and others being more prone to denting if struck by a branch or dropped in a truck bed with too much force, for example. Remember, your helmet may prevent serious injury or even save your life, so treat it with care. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t ride that often, most helmets will last for several years without issue. If you ride every day, you’ll probably want to replace your helmet more frequently, every couple of seasons or so. Always remember, if you crash and impact the helmet, it should be replaced. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Value</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mountain bike helmets vary wildly in terms of price with the models we tested ranging between $75 and $300. Sure, many of the more expensive models feature the latest and greatest technology, lighter weights, and flashier designs. The reality is, that any of these helmets will protect you better than none at all, and even the least expensive model we tested, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-camber-cpsc-helmet\">Specialized Camber</a>, beats many of the costlier models in Virginia Tech’s impact testing and looks pretty darn good doing it. So, you don’t <em>have to</em> spend a lot for quality head protection, but it’s your head and brain we’re talking about here, so you make the call. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions About Mountain Bike Helmets</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>What Type of Mountain Bike Helmet Should I Choose?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>It all depends on the type of riding you’re doing and how much protection you think you need. If you’re an XC rider who isn’t getting too gnarly and wants a lightweight and well-ventilated helmet, go for an XC model. If you’re a trail, all-mountain, or enduro rider who wants some more coverage for rowdier riding, an extended coverage half-shell is probably the best bet. If you’re getting into really aggressive terrain, massive jumps, and high speeds, or are simply worried about crashing on your face, then a full-face helmet may be the right choice. Want the option to choose? Convertible helmets can work as both a full-face and half-shell. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>How Much Should I Spend?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>It’s hard to put a price on the protection of your head and brain. While you don’t <em>need</em> to shell out for the most expensive helmet on the market to protect your head, many people will choose to do so regardless. Most quality bike helmets range between $100-$300, with a select few coming in below the $100 mark that we would actually recommend. So, even if you’re on a tight budget, a helmet like the Specialized Camber is a great option. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Do MIPS and Other Rotational Impact Protection Systems Actually Work?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>There is a bit of speculation as to whether or not rotational impact protection systems actually do anything. If you look at MIPS’s own research along with the fact that the 50 top-ranked bike helmets in the Virginia Tech impact test ratings have MIPS or something similar, we feel that it’s safe to say that yes, there is something to it. It’s our brains we’re talking about here, and even the slightest increase in protection is something that we’re on board with. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>If I Crash and Hit My Head, Should I Replace My Helmet?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Yes! Helmets protect your head by absorbing forces that typically cause the shell and foam to deform, crack, and compress. This often causes the helmet’s integrity and protective qualities to be compromised. A helmet should always be replaced after it has been impacted in a crash. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>What About Women’s Mountain Bike Helmets?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>After a strong push towards gender-specific cycling gear several years ago, many brands have returned to unisex models. This is particularly true in the helmet market, where color is often the primary difference between men’s and women’s models. While some brands do make women’s models that may accommodate long hair and ponytails better, there is little else to require gender specificity in mountain bike helmets.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<h4>Related Content</h4>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-hitch-bike-racks/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Yakima StageTwo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Hitch Bike Racks of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-helmets/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"1874\" height=\"1249\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1.jpeg\" alt=\"POC Omne Air MIPS road bike helmet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1.jpeg 1874w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Road Bike Helmets of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-helmet/\">The Best Mountain Bike Helmets of 2023</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jeremy Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"77353dbf4458230175004d4691f77416af69921d5d67f618f5920d379b924795","category":"Cycling"}
