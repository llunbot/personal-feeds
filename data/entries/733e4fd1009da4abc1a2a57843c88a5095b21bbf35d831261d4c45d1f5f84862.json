The latest comes from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who states in an investor’s note that the iPhone 13 could have <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/29/iphone-13-to-feature-leo-to-make-calls-and-text/&amp;xcust=1-1-354402-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">low earth orbit satellite connectivity</a>, which would allow users to make phone calls when cellular coverage is unavailable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Kuo (who has a record of reliable reports), the iPhone 13 will be equipped with a custom Qualcomm X60 modem that works with low earth satellites. Kuo also says that Qualcomm has been working with Globalstar to use the company’s satellite communications service. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it’s unclear as to how the user can get access to a satellite service. Kuo explains one “scenario” in which the user’s network operator has a partnership with Globalstar, and connecting to the satellites would be done through the carrier. Also, in this scenario, the user doesn’t have to sign up for another phone plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the satellite feature comes to fruition, the iPhone 13 will be the first consumer-level phone with it. According to Kuo, other companies will be using Qualcomm’s X65 modem to implement low earth orbit satellite connectivity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it’s an interesting feature, however, it’s unlikely to be one most consumers are going to use. And that if it’s accurate. A Twitter thread by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/saschasegan/status/1432156620331667456&amp;xcust=1-1-354402-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Sascha Segan of PCMag</a> explains how Kuo might have his information wrong due to the intricacies of Globalstar and its networks. He surmises that the new band in the modem could be ground-based LTE rather than satellites. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>OKAY. I think I may have gotten to the bottom of this \"iPhone 13 will include satellite connectivity\" rumor, and it could be \"iPhone Math\" levels of game-of-telephone.
