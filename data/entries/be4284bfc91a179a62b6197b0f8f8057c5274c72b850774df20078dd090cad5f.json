{"title":"Copilot Plus PCs, Where the ‘Plus’ Means More Dumb Stickers","link":"https://www.threads.net/@thurrott/post/C8X-mm1uP9f/","date":1718847795000,"content":"\n<p>Paul Thurrott on Threads, after getting his new Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge laptop:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Former Windows head Terry Myerson once told me the goal of\npartnering with Qualcomm on Windows on Arm was to “get those\nf#$%ing Intel stickers off of PCs.”</p>\n\n<p>Mission accomplished, Terry. There are no Intel stickers on the\nnew Qualcomm-based Copilot+ PCs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Still covered with stickers. And as Thurrott’s photo hints at, and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/06/crooked-samsung-stickers.jpeg\">this screenshot</a> from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkVI57ZHg9c\">Tim Schofield’s unboxing video</a> shows clearly, Samsung can’t even be bother to apply the stickers straight. Looks like they were applied by a little kid. Screams “premium” experience.</p>\n\n<p>Two of these stickers don’t even make sense. The Snapdragon one is obviously paid for by Qualcomm, the same way Intel pays PC makers to apply their stickers. But why would Samsung booger up its own laptops with stickers promoting their own Dynamic AMOLED 2X display technology? And what’s the deal with the Energy Star stickers? Who pays to put those on laptops and why?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/19/copilot-plus-stickers\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"be4284bfc91a179a62b6197b0f8f8057c5274c72b850774df20078dd090cad5f","category":"Tech"}
