But government officials have long opposed plans to make the technology more widely available, citing the risk that terrorists, sex traffickers, child abusers, and other criminals will use encrypted messages to evade law enforcement.</p>\n<p>The latest call to abandon encryption plans was made today by the Virtual Global Taskforce, a <a href=\"https://nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/virtual-global-taskforce/\">consortium</a> of 15 law enforcement agencies, including two from the US: the FBI and ICE Homeland Security Investigations. The task force focuses specifically on child sexual abuse; other members include Europol and agencies from the UK, Canada, Colombia, Australia, New Zealand, Kenya, the Philippines, the United Arab Emirates, the Netherlands, and South Korea.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933073#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933073&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"212bbbc9749067b5b81e2a65bc3b865b1e565049971e12aaebf9b5914cb704e5","category":"Tech"}
