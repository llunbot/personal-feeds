The fleeing vehicle entered San Francisco and went careening through the city’s crowded streets. At the intersection of 11th and Folsom streets, it sideswiped the fronts of two other vehicles, veered onto a sidewalk, and hit two pedestrians.</p>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://abc7news.com/police-chase-san-francisco-waymo-pursuit-crash/14011545/\" target=\"_blank\">local news story</a>, both pedestrians were taken to the hospital with one suffering major injuries. The driver of the silver sedan was injured, as was a passenger in one of the other vehicles.</p>\n<p>No one was injured in the third car, a driverless Waymo robotaxi. Still, Waymo was required to report the crash to government agencies. It was one of 20 crashes with injuries that Waymo has reported through June.  And it’s the only crash Waymo has classified as causing a serious injury.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049121#p3\">Read 35 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049121&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
