Instead, one of Apple's documents in the application confirms that the Vision Pro supports regular Wi-Fi 6, which operates on the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has yet to share full tech specs for the Vision Pro, so only limited details are available. Apple has so far said the headset is equipped with its M2 chip, an all-new R1 chip that processes camera and microphone input, and 256GB of base storage. <em>MacRumors</em> discovered that the headset is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/apple-vision-pro-how-much-ram-and-storage/\">equipped with 16GB of RAM</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the U.S., Vision Pro pre-orders begin this Friday, January 19 at 5 a.m. Pacific Time, with pricing starting at $3,499. The headset <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-announces-february-2-vision-pro-launch/\">launches on Friday, February 2</a>, and Apple previously said that availability would expand to more countries later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>Update:</strong> Vision Pro also appears to lack Ultra Wideband support, according to <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/16/apple-vision-pro-uwb-wifi-6e-7/\"><em>9to5Mac</em>'s Zac Hall</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/apple-vision-pro-lacks-wi-fi-6e-support/\">Apple Vision Pro Lacks Wi-Fi 6E Support</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-lacks-wi-fi-6e-support.2416525/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e60eb4b89bb8d08efa787a083212dbc7220eb83762c9a08509e04cd941e5f7fc","category":"Apple"}
