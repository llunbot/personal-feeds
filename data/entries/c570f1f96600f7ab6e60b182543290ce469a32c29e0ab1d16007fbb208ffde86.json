But long-term commitments to streaming companies that are in the throes of trying to determine how to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/netflix-hungry-for-more-growth-signals-more-price-hikes/\">maintain</a> or achieve growth typically end up biting subscribers in the butt—and they're getting fed up.</p>\n<p>As first reported by <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/amazon-prime-video-ad-tier-lawsuit-1235822779/\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, a lawsuit seeking class-action certification [<a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/gov.uscourts.wawd_.331191.1.0.pdf\">PDF</a>] hit Amazon on February 9.
