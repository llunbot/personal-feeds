Now, a non-hybrid version of Alfa’s answer to models like the BMW X1 and Audi Q3 has joined the fray, sporting turbocharged power, standard all-wheel drive, and the same sharp styling at a significantly lower base price. But old habits die hard, and as I discovered over the course of a few days with the latest iteration of the Tonale, even Alfa Romeo’s most pragmatic offerings have their fair share of quirks.</p>\n<p>The new base model comes with a double overhead-cam 2.0 L inline four-cylinder engine producing 268 hp (200 kW) and 295 lb-ft (400 Nm) of torque. The turbocharged mill is paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission and an all-wheel drive system that can send up to 50 percent of the available torque to the rear wheels. While those numbers are down a bit compared to the Tonale Hybrid, at 3,715 lbs (1,685 kg), the 2.0 L Turbo is more than 400 lbs (181 kg) lighter than the PHEV model.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/2025-alfa-romeo-tonale-turbo-review-italian-charm-that-cuts-both-ways/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/2025-alfa-romeo-tonale-turbo-review-italian-charm-that-cuts-both-ways/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Bradley Iger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a7c9325ef089d21a99af17ef4b65a81a1334aebbd18ba38f154db6903afe51e7","category":"Tech"}
