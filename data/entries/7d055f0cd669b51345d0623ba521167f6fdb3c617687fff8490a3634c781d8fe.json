Anyone can submit a route in the US that a beginner can bike in two to five days, with approximately 20-50 miles of riding each day.</p>\n<p>“I am pleased to be expanding our route library with these community-sourced Short Routes and look forward to seeing what places are begging to be discovered by a new audience,” said Jennifer Hamelman, Director of Routes. “Submitting a favorite regional trip is a fabulous way to contribute to and help us grow the bicycle travel movement.”</p>\n<p>Short routes are two- to five-day bicycle routes and itineraries, crafted with the beginner adventurer in mind and are available free as Ride with GPS routes on the Adventure Cycling website. Current Short Routes start from Los Angeles, CA; Washington, DC; Atlanta, GA; Boston, MA; Minneapolis, MN; Philadelphia, PA; Austin, TX; and Seattle, WA.</p>\n<p>While Adventure Cycling is known for its long, epic bicycle touring routes around the United States, life’s commitments can sometimes make it challenging to embark on long, multi-week tours. These shorter routes, allowing cyclists to escape from the daily grind without sacrificing the enchantment of bicycle travel. A community-driven approach ensures that these routes are reviewed for accessibility, so cyclists can experience the thrill of adventure, even with limited time, skills, or equipment.</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.adventurecycling.org/routes-and-maps/short-routes/\" target=\"_blank\">Adventurecycling.org</a></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/LE-PILGRIMAGE-PRESS-1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/LE-PILGRIMAGE-PRESS-1-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/LE-PILGRIMAGE-PRESS-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,576&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/LE-PILGRIMAGE-PRESS-1-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1125&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/LE-PILGRIMAGE-PRESS-1-scaled.jpg?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/LE-PILGRIMAGE-PRESS-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1013&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/LE-PILGRIMAGE-PRESS-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,751&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/LE-PILGRIMAGE-PRESS-1-scaled.jpg?resize=700,394&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/LE-PILGRIMAGE-PRESS-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,864&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/LE-PILGRIMAGE-PRESS-1-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1152&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.le-pilgrimage.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Le Pilgrimage Gravel Challenge</a></h3>\n<p>The idea behind Le Pilgrimage is something fresh and innovative in the world of gravel events. Le Pilgrimage is a self-supported and hosted centre-based, three-stage event, with each stage being progressively more challenging than the one before. Stage 1 will be 100-130kms in length, with 3500 to 4000m of climbing. Stage 2 will be similar distance, but with the climbing upped to between 3600 and 4200m. Stage 3 is the ‘queen’ stage and will be 200-230kms in length and will include a whopping 6000 to 6500m of climbing. “As this stage is so challenging, we suspect many people will want to bivvy out en-route and we can provide advice on potential places to sleep including camping and hotel options for those who want it too” said Simon. ‘But, for those who prefer to sleep in the basecamp, there’s a shortcut option too.’</p>\n<p>The exact route details and stats will be confirmed closer to the date of the event, which kicks off on September 15th after a welcome dinner with local cuisine for all pilgrims on the 14th of september.</p>\n<p>The event takes place in Puy Saint Vincent situated in the Écrins National Parc, on the French/Italian border. Each day promises to involve “breath-taking mountain summits, riding through hidden valleys, passing isolated refuges, reaching high-altitude mountain lakes and setting your eyes on glaciers by tackling some of the toughest and most trying trails.”</p>\n<p>Check out more information at <a href=\"https://www.le-pilgrimage.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.le-pilgrimage.com</a> and follow the event on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/le_pilgrimage/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>\n<div><span><span>﻿</span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRWjNeX6O1A\" target=\"_blank\">Café Americano</a></h3>\n<p>Follow along on an immersive experience with adventure filmmaker, Joey Schusler as Yeti rider, Shawn Neer guides us through the Italian countryside in search of the best cup of coffee life has to give.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><span><span>﻿</span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukEqXG3yPmE\" target=\"_blank\">The Story Behind Grit Cycles</a></h3>\n<p>If you’ve ever wondered how bike shops are started, here’s a great behind the scenes look at how <a href=\"https://gritcycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Grit Cycles</a> came to be…</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Radavision</h3>\n<p>Stuff we see on the ‘net that causes pause…</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2160\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/364360728_1315809246025560_861561555920076195_n.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/364360728_1315809246025560_861561555920076195_n.jpg?w=2160&amp;quality=75 2160w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/364360728_1315809246025560_861561555920076195_n.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/364360728_1315809246025560_861561555920076195_n.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/364360728_1315809246025560_861561555920076195_n.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/364360728_1315809246025560_861561555920076195_n.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/364360728_1315809246025560_861561555920076195_n.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/364360728_1315809246025560_861561555920076195_n.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/364360728_1315809246025560_861561555920076195_n.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/364360728_1315809246025560_861561555920076195_n.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Photo and monstrosity by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cvhkx0Yu0rM/\" target=\"_blank\">@bicyclepubes</a></em></p>\n<p>Wanna win this glorious Shitbike?

Go donate to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/abortionfunds/\">@abortionfunds</a> aka The National Network Of Abortion Funds. It’s the top link in their link tree (It’s in Pubey’s bio too). You have the ability to split your money up between chapters of your choice in case you want to support something local. Or it defaults and splits your money evenly across all chapters.</em></p>\n<p><em>2. DM <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bicyclepubes/\" target=\"_blank\">@BicyclePubes</a> the receipt from your donation. NO DISAPPEARING PICTURE MESSAGES. That will only confuse him and he can’t afford to be any more confused.</em></p>\n<p><em>Every $5 gets you a ticket in the r*ffle. You can donate between now and Thursday, August 17th. I will then pick a winner on August 18th.</em></p>\n<p><em>Pubes will cover shipping in the US. If you’re not from the US and you win, you have to pay shipping.</em></p>\n<p>And remember, if you do not like abortions, you should not get one. Then after not getting one, you should mind your own fucking business.</p>\n<p><em>If you’d like your photo featured in our Radar Roundup posts, tag us <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theradavist/\" target=\"_blank\">on Instagram</a>!</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/radar-roundup-revel-bikes-new-rw30-wheels-hyacinth-stainless-racks-engin-subcompact-spider-adventure-cycling-short-routes-le-pilgrimage-cafe-americano-and-grit-cycles/\">Radar Roundup: Revel Bikes New RW30 Wheels, Hyacinth Stainless Racks, Engin Subcompact Spider, Adventure Cycling Short Routes, Le Pilgrimage, Café Americano, and Grit Cycles</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"7d055f0cd669b51345d0623ba521167f6fdb3c617687fff8490a3634c781d8fe","category":"Cycling"}
