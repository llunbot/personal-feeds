So whether you need to upgrade your storage, or you want to get a new Galaxy or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/pixel-7-pro-review-google-makes-refinements-to-the-best-android-phone/\">Pixel</a> phone, there's something in there to help you stay productive and entertained.</p>\n<h2>Android smartphone deals</h2>\n<p>Samsung's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/02/samsungs-galaxy-s23-starts-at-800-ships-february-17/\">Galaxy S23</a> launched not too long ago, and we're starting to see discounts on the company's flagship handset series. The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra promises solid photography capabilities, with Samsung's \"Nightography\" for low-light images and the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/samsung-says-it-adds-fake-detail-to-moon-photos-via-reference-photos/\">controversial</a> 100X Space Zoom. Outside of the bump to a 200-megapixel sensor, this year's upgrades are more modest: You still get a similar design to the prior S22 series, and the faster, more efficient processor is considered a nice quality-of-life update. So while it may not be worth it for someone with last year's flagship to upgrade, if you're coming from an older phone, the S23 promises fast speeds, 5G connectivity, and a great camera experience.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra with 256GB storage for $1,100 (was $1,200) at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3z4ToHv\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a></li>\n<li>Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra with 512GB storage for $1,280 (was $1,380) at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/40zBs3s\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a></li>\n<li>Samsung Galaxy S23+ with 256GB storage for $900 (was $1,000) at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3K7eFXF\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a></li>\n<li>Samsung Galaxy S23+ with 512GB storage for $1,020 (was $1,120) at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/40eCsui\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a></li>\n<li>Samsung Galaxy S23 with 128GB storage for $750 (was $800) at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3LO19ZW\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a></li>\n<li>Samsung Galaxy S23 with 256GB storage for $810 (was $860) at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3z4Utz3\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you prefer Google's vision for what the Android operating system ought to look like rather than Samsung's skinned One UI variant on the Galaxy, the Pixel 7 delivers the purest version of the OS. Though the Pixel 7 doesn't come with the Galaxy's high zoom and megapixel count, Google's investment in A.I. and computation photography is no slouch, and the Pixel 7 delivers some of the best images captured on a smartphone with its unique camera bar design on the rear, and now you can get all that with up to a 25 percent discount. The larger <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/pixel-7-pro-review-google-makes-refinements-to-the-best-android-phone/\">Pixel 7 Pro</a> comes with a 5x optical telephoto lens that can capture images with up to 30x Super Res zoom with digital cropping, whereas the non-Pro version lacks the telephoto shooter.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926609#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926609&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Chuong Nguyen","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"46fb11664f1ad2c061333831233974bb62ba009e7fd7bbb35de80c28d7f3c499","category":"Tech"}
