This sequel to the iconic <em>Ghostbusters</em> films from the 1980s introduces a new generation to the franchise. So it's fitting that the film is directed by Jason Reitman (<em>Juno</em>,<em> Thank You for Smoking</em>), son of Ivan Reitman, director of the 1980s films and one of the producers on <em>Afterlife</em>.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/a-new-generation-aint-afraid-of-no-ghosts-in-ghostbusters-afterlife-trailer/\">I've written previously</a>, Vanity Fair <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/12/ghostbusters-afterlife-first-look\">offered a first look</a> at the latest film in [<em>checks notes</em>] December 2019, featuring several stills—including one showing the tricked-out ambulance from the original <em>Ghostbusters</em>. Per the official synopsis, \"A single mother and her two children move to Summerville, Oklahoma, after inheriting property from a previously unknown relative. They discover their family's legacy to the original Ghostbusters, who have become something of a myth, as many have long since forgotten the events of the 'Manhattan Crossrip of 1984'\"—i.e., the events of the original film.  </p>\n<p>Carrie Coon (<em>The Leftovers</em>) plays mom Callie, while Mckenna Grace (<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/haunting-of-hill-house-offers-chills-aplenty-but-also-tugs-at-the-heart/\"><em>The Haunting of Hill House</em></a>) plays her science-loving daughter Phoebe.
