The biggest story in the data is the dramatic growth of solar energy, with a 30 percent increase in generation in a single year, which will allow solar and wind combined to overtake coal in 2024.</p>\n<p>But the US energy demand saw an increase of nearly 3 percent, which is roughly double the amount of additional solar generation. Should electric use continue to grow at a similar pace, renewable production will have to continue to grow dramatically for a few years before it can simply cover the added demand.</p>\n<h2>Going for the Sun</h2>\n<p>In the first 11 months of 2024, the US saw its electrical use grow by 2.8 percent, or roughly 100 Terawatt-hours. While there's typically year-to-year variation in use due to weather-driven demand, the US's consumption has largely been flat since the early 2000s. There are plenty of reasons to expect increased demand, including the growth of data centers and the electrification of heating and transit, but so far, there's been no clear sign of it in the data.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/us-solar-boom-continues-but-its-offset-by-rising-power-use/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/us-solar-boom-continues-but-its-offset-by-rising-power-use/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"396618b3b96eb0f2273db6991eef468a8bb49d61606c8c37123e032bcceb2423","category":"Tech"}
