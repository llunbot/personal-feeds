In a unique move, Disney is introducing a small, potential financial benefit to Disney+ and Hulu subscribers in the form of some third-party discounts, freebies, trials, and contests.</p>\n<p>As of today, Disney+ subscribers can log into Disney’s <a href=\"https://perks.disneyplus.com/en_us/discover\">Disney+ Perks website</a> with their streaming credentials to get access to a revolving selection of discounts and freebies. When I logged in today, I was met with options for several free trials, including a six-month one to DoorDash’s premium subscription offering, a three-month trial to Clear+, and a two-month trial to Duolingo’s premium subscription.</p>\n<p>Disney+ subscribers can also get discounts, including to Adidas’ online marketplaces and “select” Disney Resorts Collection hotels (<em>if</em> you stay at least two nights, with most availability occurring between June 29 and July 31). There are also some free virtual rewards for Disney-owned games and the ability to enter sweepstakes, like for going to the premiere of the movie <em>Freakier Friday.</em></p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/amid-rising-prices-disney-and-hulu-offer-subscribers-some-freebies/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/amid-rising-prices-disney-and-hulu-offer-subscribers-some-freebies/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c7797a2578c86e0a1a61295af14ae93300b71d3a2c63bf2712c5960fd0c34dd0","category":"Tech"}
