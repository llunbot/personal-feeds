DALL-E 3 renders images by closely following complex descriptions and handling in-image text generation (such as labels and signs), which challenged earlier models. Currently in research preview, it will be available to ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise customers in early October.</p>\n\n<p>Like its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/openai-image-generator-dall-e-now-available-without-waitlist/\">predecessor</a>, DALLE-3 is a text-to-image generator that creates novel images based on written descriptions called prompts. Although OpenAI released no technical details about DALL-E 3, the AI model at the heart of previous versions of DALL-E was trained on millions of images created by human artists and photographers, some of them licensed from stock websites like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/shutterstock-partners-with-openai-to-sell-ai-generated-artwork-compensate-artists/\">Shutterstock</a>. It's likely DALL-E 3 follows this same formula, but with new training techniques and more computational training time.</p>\n<p>Judging by the samples provided by OpenAI on its promotional blog, DALL-E 3 appears to be a radically more capable image synthesis model than anything else available in terms of following prompts. While OpenAI's examples have been cherry-picked for their effectiveness, they appear to follow the prompt instructions faithfully and convincingly render objects with minimal deformations. Compared to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/openai-image-generator-dall-e-now-available-without-waitlist/\">DALL-E 2</a>, OpenAI says that DALL-E 3 refines small details like hands more effectively, creating engaging images by default with \"no hacks or prompt engineering required.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969719#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969719&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a795b742dcb40ef102aa8b99fc1ac3824ed709343764bc49dc3acdde80e5fffb","category":"Tech"}
