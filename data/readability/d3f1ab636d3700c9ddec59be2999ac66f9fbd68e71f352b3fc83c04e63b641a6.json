The riders rolled down a ramp constructed over the steps of the gothic cathedral and onto the very technical course, starting up a 2.5 km 3rd-category climb.

Alex Aranburu (Astana-Premier Tech) laid down a new best time a short while later, and defending champion Roglič was the only rider who could spoil the Spaniard’s day, going six seconds faster. Third place was taken by Slovenian national TT champion Jan Tratnik (Bahrain-Victorious).</p><p>Further down the standings, none of the GC favourites had any major problems with only seconds lost and gained here and there.</p><div><div><p>La Vuelta ciclista a España (2.UWT) <span>Burgos → Burgos</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/cc/primoz-roglic-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"d3f1ab636d3700c9ddec59be2999ac66f9fbd68e71f352b3fc83c04e63b641a6","category":"Cycling"}
