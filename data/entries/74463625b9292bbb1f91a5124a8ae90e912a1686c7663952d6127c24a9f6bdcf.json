However, the most significant, and controversial, is the loss of the iconic thumb shifter.</p>\n<p>Prior to Super Record Wireless, Campagnolo had stuck steadfastly to the same shifting arrangement since the end of the down-tube shifting era.</p>\n<p>The shifter paddle, located behind the brake lever, shifted into a larger cassette cog or the big chainring. The thumb shifter on the inside of the lever body shifted into a smaller cassette cog or small chainring.</p>\n<p>Because the two buttons were distinct, it was impossible to confuse their function.</p>\n<p>The thumb shifter was also a glorious thing to use, its satisfying ‘ker-clunk’ sound unmistakable, even on Campagnolo’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electronic-groupsets/\">electronic groupsets</a>.</p>\n<section><div>\n        \n<h3>More on the launch of Campagnolo Super Record Wireless</h3>\n<ul><li>Everything you need to know about <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/campagnolo-super-record-wireless-groupset/\">Campagnolo Super Record Wireless</a></li>\n<li>Read Oscar’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/campagnolo-super-record-wireless/\">Campagnolo Super Record Wireless first ride review</a></li>\n<li>Check out these <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/campagnolo-super-record-wireless-bikes\">bikes with Campagnolo’s new Super Record Wireless groupset</a></li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>So, what’s changed?</h2>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-shifter-logic-annotated-right-011d7fe.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Annotated image of Campagnolo Super Record Wireless lever button functions\" title=\"Annotated image of Campagnolo Super Record Wireless lever button functions\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>There are two buttons, one on top of the other. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-shifter-logic-annotated-left-d64f821.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Annotated image of Campagnolo Super Record Wireless lever button functions\" title=\"Annotated image of Campagnolo Super Record Wireless lever button functions\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The left-hand shifter functions in much the same way. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Super Record Wireless changes things completely.</p>\n<p>The shift logic is similar to Shimano Di2, with two buttons on the paddle separated vertically, rather than overlaying one another.</p>\n<p>The upper button on the right shifter shifts the rear derailleur into an easier gear and the low button into a harder gear. The left shifter works in the opposite manner, so the upper button shifts you into the big chainring and the lower button a smaller chainring.</p>\n\n<h2>The thumb shifter had its detractors, but they were wrong</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Record 12 shifters on Pinarello GAN K\" title=\"Campagnolo Record 12 shifters on Pinarello GAN K\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some found it difficult to access the thumb shifter from the drops.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Campagnolo says its decision to remove the thumb shifter was market-oriented – there was an equal split between those who appreciated it and those who didn’t.</p>\n<p>The chief complaint that thumb shifter detractors had was it was difficult to reach from the drops.</p>\n<p>I’ve never really understood this – it’s easy to pivot your thumb slightly to give the shifter a thwack to change into a harder gear. Also, I rarely change chainrings when I’m in the drops anyway.</p>\n<p>Regardless, Campagnolo’s previous product cycle experimented with the thumb-shifter design to try to address some of these complaints.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/04/DSC00232-f693180.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"BMC ICS cockpit on BMC Teammachine SLR01 with Campagnolo Super Record EPS\" title=\"BMC ICS cockpit on BMC Teammachine SLR01 with Campagnolo Super Record EPS\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The thumb shifter has a downward sweep on Super Record 12 EPS. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2022/06/Pinarello-Grevil-F-07-5401efa.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Campagnolo Ekar brake and shift lever on the Pinarello Grevil F gravel bike\" title=\"Campagnolo Ekar brake and shift lever on the Pinarello Grevil F gravel bike\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Ekar features a C-shaped lever. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Ben Delaney / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2020/09/Campagnolo-Ekar-thumb-paddle-1-7aa5e3b.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Stepped thumb shifter on inside of right brake hood\" title=\"Campagnolo-Ekar-thumb-paddle-1\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The C-shape lever enables better access from the drops of the handlebars.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/cyclings-worst-kept-secret-campagnolos-super-record-12-speed-eps-groupset-launches/\">Super Record 12 EPS</a>, the brand introduced more of a downward sweep on the thumb shifter to allow better access from the drops.</p>\n<p>The thumb shifter was also radically changed on the brand’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/campagnolo-ekar-groupset-review/\">Ekar gravel groupset, </a>where it introduced a new C-shaped lever.</p>\n<p>With this design, not only could you change gear from the tops, but also from the drops because Campagnolo had introduced a textured grip on the inside of the lever.</p>\n<h2>Has Campagnolo sacrificed its identity?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record EPS 12 speed shifter on BMC Teammachine SLR01 against a wall\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record EPS 12 speed shifter on BMC Teammachine SLR01 against a wall\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The outgoing Super Record EPS shifter is a thing of beauty.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Campagnolo occupies an increasingly niche position, with Shimano and SRAM dominating the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/shimano-dura-ace-sram-red-campagnolo-super-record-compared/\">groupset arms race</a>.</p>\n<p>If it wants a bigger market share, it has to think with its head rather than its heart in terms of finance and appeal to a larger demographic. That may explain why the brand has decided to ditch the thumb shifter.</p>\n<p>However, to discard it is to lose one of Campagnolo’s distinguishing differences and the move may alienate a lot of the brand’s devotees.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo has always said its electronic groupsets represented an ‘electro-mechanisation’ of its mechanical counterparts – a concerted effort to keep electronic shifting as close as possible in feel to mechanical.</p>\n<p>Super Record Wireless represents an outright rejection of that principle.</p>\n<h2>The never-ending cycle of evolution</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 ST-R9270 shifter\" title=\"Shimano_Dura-Ace_Di2_R9270_Fairlight_Strael 3_090\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Shimano continues to experiment with its shifter ergonomics.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Though it’s not perfect, Shimano has continued to improve the shifter ergonomics over its four generations of Di2. In later generations, the brand added more of a defined click into the paddle, to improve lever feel.</p>\n<p>It also introduced golfball texturing to differentiate the two buttons, which can be a problem when wearing <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-winter-cycling-gloves/\">winter cycling gloves</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Berria Belader Allroad LTD against a graffiti background\" title=\"BR_09997\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> I don’t find the hood material particularly supple on SRAM’s latest levers and find the slight ridge at the base of the hood uncomfortable.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>And, while I’m not a fan of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-rival-etap-axs-review/\">SRAM’s smaller Rival shifter ergonomics</a> (which it has also <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-force-axs-review/\">ported over to Force</a>), most testers feel they are an improvement over the bulbous previous generation.</p>\n<p>On the previous shifter layout, with the lever paddle and thumb shifter, Campagnolo’s EPS levers struck a chord with those who had ridden its mechanical groupsets.</p>\n<p>While changes are always made with the intention of improving a product – and Campagnolo has made positive tweaks to the shifter and hood ergonomics elsewhere –  getting rid of a feature so critical to the brand’s success represents a stark change.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Zipp Service Course SL70 handlebar and stem on Pinarello GAN K\" title=\"Zipp Service Course SL70 handlebar and stem on Pinarello GAN K\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Record 12 levers on my Pinarello felt like home after riding Super Record Wireless.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As a point of comparison, I rode my <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tech/bikeradar-builds-oscar-huckle-pinarello-gan-k/\">Pinarello GAN K</a>, equipped with mechanical Record 12, the day after taking Super Record Wireless for a first ride at Campagnolo’s media launch.
