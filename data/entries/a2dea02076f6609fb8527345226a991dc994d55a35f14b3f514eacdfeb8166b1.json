{"title":"Charlie Warzel: ‘Twitter Is a Far-Right Social Network’","link":"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/elon-musk-ron-desantis-2024-twitter/674149/","date":1684884187000,"content":"\n<p>Charlie Warzel, writing for The Atlantic:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Twitter has so fully assumed the role of a far-right platform that\nit might be killing its competitors. When Parler shut down in\nApril, its parent company noted <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/parler-shut-down-new-owner-starboard-twitter-clone-conservatives-1235583709/\">that</a> “no reasonable person\nbelieves that a Twitter clone just for conservatives is a viable\nbusiness any more.” Left unspoken is the reason: Twitter has\nbecome a right-wing echo chamber.</p>\n\n<p>If Musk weren’t too preoccupied lapping up approval from trolls,\nreactionaries, and Dogecoin enthusiasts — a few of the\nconstituencies left on his site that still seem to adore him — the Parler statement should worry him. Right-wing alt-tech\nplatforms may attract investors and a flood of indignant new users\nwith persecution complexes, but they are, ultimately, bad\nbusinesses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A fairer headline would be “Twitter Is a Far-Right-Friendly Social Network”, but that’s enough to be a problem.</p>\n\n<p>I still check in on Twitter, but with each passing week, less and less. It’s not fun, it’s hard to use without Tweetbot, and the new algorithm that puts paying Twitter Blue users’ replies <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidrvetter/status/1639548273533788160\">at the top</a> of every thread has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1660692106782883841\">ruined</a> political Twitter. It’s like letting people suffering from incontinence try on all the pants in a store before anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>And the right-wing veer is most obvious in the ads that I see. (And I now see a lot of them — one every 3–4 posts.) Almost <em>all</em> of them are for no-name gimmicks and gadgets, the sort of crap that used to be sold at the mall <a href=\"https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/504249/history-spencer-gifts\">at Spencer Gifts</a> or in the middle of the night on cable TV commercials.</p>\n\n<p>One of the few exceptions I see is Apple, which continues to place ads on Twitter.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/23/warzel-twitter-rightwing\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a2dea02076f6609fb8527345226a991dc994d55a35f14b3f514eacdfeb8166b1","category":"Tech"}
