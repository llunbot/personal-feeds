My intent was never to do anything illegal.\"</p>\n<p>Previous versions of the User Vision software offered more basic cheating functions like \"recoil adjustment\" that automatically steadies a player's aim and a \"trigger bot\" that shoots automatically when an enemy is detected in the player's crosshairs.
