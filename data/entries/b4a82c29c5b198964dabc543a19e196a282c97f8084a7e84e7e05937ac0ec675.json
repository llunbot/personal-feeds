If clippings become indispensable to your workflow, consider creating a dedicated folder to store them, otherwise they can quickly clutter up your desktop.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBear in mind that Text Clippings store content in a unique format that may not be compatible across all platforms or devices. So if you're sharing clippings, it's best to convert them into standard text formats to ensure they can be opened elsewhere. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macos/\">macOS</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/macos-tip-create-text-clippings-productivity/\">Quick macOS Tip: Create and Use Text Clippings for Productivity</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/quick-macos-tip-create-and-use-text-clippings-for-productivity.2450216/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b4a82c29c5b198964dabc543a19e196a282c97f8084a7e84e7e05937ac0ec675","category":"Apple"}
