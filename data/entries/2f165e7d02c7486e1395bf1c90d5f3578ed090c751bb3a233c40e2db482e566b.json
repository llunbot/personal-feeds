Currently, the format options here are APFS (with options for Case Sensitive or Encrypted), ExFAT, and MS-DOS (FAT), the same format options available in Disc Utility (with the exception of macOS extension formats which wouldn't make much sense for this feature on iPadOS). This is a major improvement for iPad power users and it will be interesting to keep an eye out for new improvements to this functionality and others within the Files app over the course of the iPadOS 18 beta cycle. It seems Apple may be taking a similar tact to the way they incorporated much of the functionality of the Preview app into the Files app via Quick Look, but now with functionality from Disc Utility.</blockquote><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/files-app-format-drives.jpeg\" width=\"1456\" height=\"970\" /><div><em>File format options in the Files app on iPadOS 18 (Image: Kaleb Cadle).</em></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPadOS 18 and iOS 18 are currently in beta.
