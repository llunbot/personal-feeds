Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/rip-iphone-home-button/\">no longer sells any iPhone models with a a Home button</a>, Touch ID, LCD screen, a sub-6-inch screen size, or Lightning.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-discontinues-iphone-14/\">discontinued the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus</a> today.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe lineup now consists of the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max, iPhone 16e, iPhone 15, and iPhone 15 Plus.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is a bit of a quirk in Apple's current iPhone lineup. The iPhone 16e has an outdated notch, yet it has Apple's latest A18 chip and Apple Intelligence support. Meanwhile, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus have the newer Dynamic Island, yet a two-generations-old A16 Bionic chip and no Apple Intelligence support.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will likely discontinue the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus when the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, and iPhone 17 Pro models launch in September.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-discontinues-iphone-se/\">Apple Discontinues iPhone SE</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-discontinues-iphone-se.2449704/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2774a2a3fa97d513b43296c9a49a52e67df1653e2a544ca6fecb6e23edf40eb1","category":"Apple"}
