He believes the upcoming model will represent the biggest redesign of the MacBook Air since 2010, with a rumor earlier this week claiming that the notebook will have a similar design as the 24-inch iMac, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/21/macbook-air-2022-details-leaked/\">off-white bezels around the display and a variety of color choices</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGurman also expects a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/19/apple-27-inch-xdr-display-early-2022-rumor/\">larger iMac with Apple silicon</a>, a new Mac mini, a new iPhone SE, and a new iPad Pro to launch after the calendar turns to 2022.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing the unveiling of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models</a> with Apple's next-generation M1 Pro and M1 Max chips this week, the only Intel-based Macs remaining in Apple's lineup include a low-end 21.5-inch iMac targeted at the education market, the 27-inch iMac, the high-end Mac mini, and the Mac Pro tower. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/22/november-apple-event-unlikely-gurman/\">Gurman: Apple Event in November Unlikely, New MacBook Air With Biggest Redesign Since 2010 to Launch Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-apple-event-in-november-unlikely-new-macbook-air-with-biggest-redesign-since-2010-to-launch-next-year.2318764/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_WImkh7ZGDg:WD_nOqHKjX8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_WImkh7ZGDg:WD_nOqHKjX8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/_WImkh7ZGDg\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c2abfd9ffe24e6a99309d2ccd8b67547a26f1548964a09af6c9c8ea13b525e79","category":"Apple"}
