That would seem at first glance to be a conundrum, but Apple Monday opened up three different ways app developers can start testing their apps on Vision Pro hardware well before the product launches to the public.</p>\n<p>None of them are surprises, of courseâ€”Apple previously laid out these plans at WWDC. But now developers can actually start signing up for and using these resources.</p>\n<p>It has been possible to get at least some serious work done since Apple made a beta release of Xcode available with support for visionOS.
