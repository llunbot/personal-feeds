This new layout resembles the runway-style camera panel seen on Google Pixel phones. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's iPhones have maintained the same front-facing design language for several years, and the rear is one of the few remaining areas for meaningful visual evolution. Based on CAD renders and leaked parts, the updated bump retains the triangular triple-lens setup on the left, but now the LiDAR scanner, microphone, and flash are repositioned to the right, creating a more symmetrical design. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's not clear what Apple's rationale is for the design shift, but it may allow for larger or more thermally efficient components, improved spatial separation of sensors for more accurate depth mapping, or simply more efficient internal packaging as Apple continues to shrink the main logic board. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe bump's uniform color, which is reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/iphone-17-pro-no-two-tone-rear-design/\">matched with the rest of the chassis</a>, suggests Apple is aiming for a more unified and visually subdued design language than previously thought. Apple is expected to introduce the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max alongside the regular iPhone 17 and an all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air around mid-September.
