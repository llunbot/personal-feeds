They needed to optimize comfort &amp; ergonomics so riders could easily stay in their most aero position longer, then to ensure great visibility while the rider was deep in their aero tuck, and of course, they wanted the absolute ultimate in aerodynamic performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ekoi-Pure-Aero-TT-helmet-designed-by-AI_time-trial-triathlon-aerodynamic_CFD-airflow.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ekoi-Pure-Aero-TT-helmet-designed-by-AI_time-trial-triathlon-aerodynamic_CFD-airflow.webp\" alt=\"Ekoi Pure Aero TT helmet designed by AI, fastest time trial &amp; triathlon aerodynamics, CFD airflow\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ekoi-Pure-Aero-TT-helmet-designed-by-AI_time-trial-triathlon-aerodynamic_CFD-airflow.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ekoi-Pure-Aero-TT-helmet-designed-by-AI_time-trial-triathlon-aerodynamic_CFD-airflow-297x248.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ekoi-Pure-Aero-TT-helmet-designed-by-AI_time-trial-triathlon-aerodynamic_CFD-airflow-120x100.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ekoi-Pure-Aero-TT-helmet-designed-by-AI_time-trial-triathlon-aerodynamic_CFD-airflow-768x640.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Giving a little insight into how one aero helmet can be fastest for all riders, Ekoi created their design based on 3D scans of 3 top TT &amp; triathlon athletes with greatly varying body sizes &amp; shapes – Stéphane Rossetto, Patrick Lange &amp; Chris Froome. That way, Ekoi leveraged CFD development to test how airflow shifted over different body types.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is a wide bulbous shell with a classic narrow but short tail. Then, it gets a huge integrated visor with sides that even slightly flare out at the bottom to redirect air around the front of the rider.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ekoi-Pure-Aero-TT-helmet-designed-by-AI_time-trial-triathlon-aerodynamic_white-with-holographic-stripes.webp\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ekoi-Pure-Aero-TT-helmet-designed-by-AI_time-trial-triathlon-aerodynamic_white-with-holographic-stripes.webp\" alt=\"2025 Ekoi Pure Aero TT helmet designed by AI, fastest time trial &amp; triathlon aerodynamics, white with holographic stripes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ekoi-Pure-Aero-TT-helmet-designed-by-AI_time-trial-triathlon-aerodynamic_white-with-holographic-stripes.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ekoi-Pure-Aero-TT-helmet-designed-by-AI_time-trial-triathlon-aerodynamic_white-with-holographic-stripes-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ekoi-Pure-Aero-TT-helmet-designed-by-AI_time-trial-triathlon-aerodynamic_white-with-holographic-stripes-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ekoi-Pure-Aero-TT-helmet-designed-by-AI_time-trial-triathlon-aerodynamic_white-with-holographic-stripes-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ekoi-Pure-Aero-TT-helmet-designed-by-AI_time-trial-triathlon-aerodynamic_white-with-holographic-stripes-768x461.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ekoi-Pure-Aero-TT-helmet-designed-by-AI_time-trial-triathlon-aerodynamic_white-with-holographic-stripes-2048x1229.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, Ekoi claims a 6% reduction of aerodynamic drag vs. any other helmet on the market.
