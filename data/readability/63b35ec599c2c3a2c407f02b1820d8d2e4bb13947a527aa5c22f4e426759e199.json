If it does feel different within the service interval, then something has likely gone wrong and it’s best to get it looked at straight away by a professional. A service is to preserve the shock’s wearing surfaces and keep performance. If left too long, you’ll just wear your shock out and likely be faced with a large bill to pay for lots of additional parts!&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17143010/j-tech-suspension-damper-servicing.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17143010/j-tech-suspension-damper-servicing.jpg\" alt=\"j-tech suspension\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17143010/j-tech-suspension-damper-servicing.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17143010/j-tech-suspension-damper-servicing-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17143010/j-tech-suspension-damper-servicing-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17143010/j-tech-suspension-damper-servicing-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17143010/j-tech-suspension-damper-servicing-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17143010/j-tech-suspension-damper-servicing-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p><strong>Full Factory Suspension: </strong>You will loose damping control – it will speed up. You will have a mushy pedaling platform (some would call it lockout, but it doesn’t fully lock out). It may also be really noisy in use. This all points to the fact that it’s time for a service.<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Trail Labs: </strong>Shocks might feel absolutely fine when it’s time for the damper to be serviced. We advise customers to follow the manufacturer’s service intervals for full rebuilds. This varies by brand and is generally 100-200 hours of riding, or one year. Riders should view this as preventative maintenance to keep their suspension components running properly, and to last longer. When a damper has failed you may notice it feels like a pogo stick during compression and rebound, meaning it acts like a spring with no control. You may also hear some sloshing or slurping noises, though it varies by design.</p><div id=\"attachment_258660\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/12125742/cushcore-pro-tire-insert-review-fanderson-004.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-258660\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/12125742/cushcore-pro-tire-insert-review-fanderson-004.jpg\" alt=\"cushcore pro testing 12 psi\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/12125742/cushcore-pro-tire-insert-review-fanderson-004.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/12125742/cushcore-pro-tire-insert-review-fanderson-004-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/12125742/cushcore-pro-tire-insert-review-fanderson-004-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/12125742/cushcore-pro-tire-insert-review-fanderson-004-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/12125742/cushcore-pro-tire-insert-review-fanderson-004-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/12125742/cushcore-pro-tire-insert-review-fanderson-004-696x464.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/12125742/cushcore-pro-tire-insert-review-fanderson-004-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/12125742/cushcore-pro-tire-insert-review-fanderson-004-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-258660\">Editor’s Note: Some dampers are much louder than others, though that’s not necessarily an indication they need a service; the SR Suntour R2C2 damper is one of the loudest we’ve tested</p></div><p><strong>What is the most common custom tune you get asked to do?</strong></p><p><strong>Full Factory Suspension: </strong>Usually just more tokens into the air chamber, but that’s not what I would call a “custom tune”.

Many forks and shocks have volume tokens, or rings, which allows the user to reduce and increase air volume. Changing the air volume, within the manufacturer’s specifications, will not void the warranty and helps the rider achieve different performance out of their suspension.</p><div id=\"attachment_248653\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fox-38-fork-grip2-damper.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-248653\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fox-38-fork-grip2-damper.jpg\" alt=\"fox 38 grip2 damper 160mm enduro fork\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fox-38-fork-grip2-damper.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fox-38-fork-grip2-damper-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fox-38-fork-grip2-damper-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fox-38-fork-grip2-damper-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fox-38-fork-grip2-damper-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fox-38-fork-grip2-damper-696x464.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fox-38-fork-grip2-damper-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fox-38-fork-grip2-damper-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-248653\">VVC High Speed and Low speed compression damping adjuster on the FOX 38 Factory fork (review <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/01/19/long-term-review-fox-38-factory-fork-with-grip2-damper-holds-fast-charges-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>)</p></div><p>The other DIY option that most suspension products support is damping adjusters, in the form of dials, which controls compression and rebound rates. Once you figure out the proper air pressure, or spring rate, for your riding weight to achieve correct sag then you should use the damping adjusters to dial in how the suspension handles. Most users should probably stay away from trying to convert something inside the damping systems, and always follow the manufacturer’s specifications when rebuilding suspension.</p><p><strong>JTech Suspension: </strong>Nothing really, depending on the specific manufacturer’s warranty policy. However, the basics are fundamental to performance and so many people get caught up in the technical tuning, that they miss the basics. Friction is the biggest enemy to suspension performance. Tight pivots, tight bushings, dry seals, poor quality/degraded/contaminated oils will all cause more friction.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17142904/j-tech-suspension-fork-servicing.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17142904/j-tech-suspension-fork-servicing.jpg\" alt=\"finlay paton full factory suspension\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17142904/j-tech-suspension-fork-servicing.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17142904/j-tech-suspension-fork-servicing-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17142904/j-tech-suspension-fork-servicing-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17142904/j-tech-suspension-fork-servicing-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17142904/j-tech-suspension-fork-servicing-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17142904/j-tech-suspension-fork-servicing-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>This friction will completely mask any performance gains you make by tuning a damper. The best thing you can do at home is do a basic service with good quality oils and greases, making sure that every pivoting/sliding part is as free as possible. Then let the professionals tune your damper.</p><p><strong>Full Factory Suspension: </strong>You can do the air volume, no problem, any more than that and you’ll need to invest in the correct tooling, this is usually the biggest hurdle.</p><p>If you can wield a spanner pretty well, you can probably do an air can service, but even that has its little pit falls and things to look out for – such as damaging the rings between the positive and negative chambers (the shock will hold air fine, but it will just drop through the travel really easily).</p><p>The main thing I would advise is take your time. Don’t get distracted, and clean the shock or fork really thoroughly before you start. Clean your working space before you start and lay all the parts out in the order you took them off. The biggest mistake people make is to get dirt inside the air chamber. This will damage the shock or fork in the long term.</p><p><em>Got a question of your own?
