Biologists are drawn to understand the suite of adaptations they have evolved to survive extreme lifestyles.

Their small size and blazing metabolism mean they live life on a knife-edge, sometimes needing to shut down their bodies almost completely just to conserve enough energy to survive the night—or to migrate thousands of miles, at times across open ocean.</p>\n<p>Their nectar-rich diet leads to blood-sugar levels that would put a person in a coma. And their zipping, zooming flight sometimes generates g-forces high enough to make a fighter pilot black out. The more researchers look, the more surprises lurk within those tiny bodies, the smallest in the avian world.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052622#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052622&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Knowable Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c32f0b82790234f4899e82fafaf5043f56d9b554461c218f36269903d889ae7f","category":"Tech"}
