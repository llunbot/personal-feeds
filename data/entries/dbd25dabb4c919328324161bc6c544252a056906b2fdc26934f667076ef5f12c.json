Whether you’re buying your first pair of AirPods or upgrading the trusty ‘buds you have used every day for years, Amazon’s twice-yearly Prime Day sales are a great time to look for a discount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many Apple products are rarely on sale, and when they <em>do</em> go on sale they’re barely at a discount at all. AirPods are an exception: As long as they’re not a just-released model, they’re almost <em>always</em> available at a discount from the official retail price. And when big sales events come around, like <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/prime-day\">Prime Day</a> or Black Friday, you can often save 25 percent or more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon is one of the best places to look for AirPods deals, and we are already seeing some excellent discounts during the Prime Day event which runs from October 8 to midnight on October 9. We’ll keep this article updated throughout Prime Day so you can quickly find the best deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods picked here are all chosen by our editors, who have decades of experience with Apple devices. We’ve reviewed everything we recommend and we won’t tell you to buy something that’s not an actual deal. The products below are all at or near all-time lows, and we’ve selected what we think is the best configuration for each product type. We know Apple is expensive, so we’ve chosen products at prices we would be willing to pay, so you can trust that our recommendations will steer you in the right direction—and save you big bucks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all the best Prime Day deals on Apple products see our round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2391988/best-apple-prime-day-2024-deals.html\">best Prime Day Apple deals</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Amazon Prime Day 2024: Best AirPods deals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With Apple revamping the AirPods range in September 2024–with the introduction of the AirPods 4 and new colors and USB-C for the AirPods Max–we can expect to see some discounts on the older, now discontinued, models over Prime Day. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>U.S. AirPods Prime Day deals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.S. we are already seeing discounts on the new AirPods 4 at Amazon. There are also some price cuts on the older AirPods</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/\">AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C case)</a>: $190 ($59 off, MSRP $249)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z/\">AirPods 4:</a> $119 ($10 off, MSRP $129)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ7HYG1/\">AirPods 4 with ANC</a>: $179 (No discount, MSRP $179)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJBQSJY/\">AirPods Max (USB-C)</a>: $535 ($14 off, MSRP $549)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1WXVQTN/\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods (3rd gen, wired case):</a> $130 ($39 off, MSRP was $169 DISCONTINUED)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PZHYWJS/\">AirPods Max (Lightning)</a>: $399 ($150 off, MSRP was $549 DISCONTINUED)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>U.K. AirPods Prime Day deals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While Amazon is yet to discount the new AirPods in the U.K. there are discounts on the older models that have been discontinued, as well as the AirPods Pro. We think that prices may drop even more before Prime Day 2 is over. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CHWZ9TZS\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods Pro (2nd generation) with MagSafe, USB-C</a>:  £229 (were £179 last Prime Day, RRP £229)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BDJ6QBTL\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods (3rd generation) with Lightning Charging Case</a>: £129 (£40 off, RRP was £169 DISCONTINUED)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09JQQDLXF\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods (3rd generation) with MagSafe Charging Case</a>: £139 (£40 off, RRP was £179 DISCONTINUED)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07PZR3PVB\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods with wired Charging Case (2nd generation)</a>: £98.80 (£30 off, RRP was £129 DISCONTINUED)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08Q1SWGDR\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods Max (2020 models)</a>: £499 (were £426.55 last Prime Day, RRP was £499 DISCONTINUED)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To see if other resellers are offering better deals take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673507/best-airpods-deals.html\">Best AirPods deals roundup</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Airpods-4_3901.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Airpods 4 bredvid AirPods Pro \" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Airpods-4_3901.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 4032w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Airpods-4_3901.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Airpods-4_3901.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Airpods-4_3901.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Airpods-4_3901.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Airpods-4_3901.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>AirPods Pro and AirPods 4.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Airpods 4 bredvid AirPods Pro \" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Airpods-4_3901.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 4032w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Airpods-4_3901.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Airpods-4_3901.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Airpods-4_3901.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Airpods-4_3901.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Airpods-4_3901.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>AirPods Pro and AirPods 4.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Petter Ahrnstedt</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Airpods 4 bredvid AirPods Pro \" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Airpods-4_3901.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 4032w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Airpods-4_3901.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Airpods-4_3901.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Airpods-4_3901.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Airpods-4_3901.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Airpods-4_3901.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>AirPods Pro and AirPods 4.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Petter Ahrnstedt</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Petter Ahrnstedt</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Amazon Prime Day 2024: How to get the best AirPods deals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon’s two Prime Days take place in the following countries: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, the U.K., and the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many deals are exclusive for Prime members, so you’ll need to sign in with an active membership.
