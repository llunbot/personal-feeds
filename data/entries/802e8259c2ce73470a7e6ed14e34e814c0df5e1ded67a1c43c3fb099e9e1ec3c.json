Now, in 2023, the talks may have resumed.</p>\n<p>The Elec <a href=\"https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=4495\">reports</a> that Samsung Electronics and LG Display have resumed discussions on a deal that would see LG supplying more than 200,000 white OLED (WOLED) panels to Samsung for a new line of Samsung-branded TVs that could launch as soon as 2024. That number would potentially be just the start of a longer partnership.</p>\n<p>When news of the negotiations first broke a couple of years ago, it was reported that the conversation was started at the behest of the South Korean government in response to an international situation wherein LCD panel-producing Chinese companies like BOE were driving up the cost of LCD panels, threatening Samsung's TV dominance. At that time, Samsung was all in on LCD technology in its TVs, competing with LG's increasing focus on OLED.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931743#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931743&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"802e8259c2ce73470a7e6ed14e34e814c0df5e1ded67a1c43c3fb099e9e1ec3c","category":"Tech"}
