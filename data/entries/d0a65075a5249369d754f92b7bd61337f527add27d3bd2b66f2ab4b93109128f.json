He continued:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As you may know, 23andMe collects and holds sensitive, immutable, identifiable personal information about millions of American consumers who have used the Company's genetic testing and telehealth services. This includes genetic information, biological DNA samples, health information, ancestry and genealogy information, personal contact information, payment and billing information, and other information, such as messages that genetic relatives can send each other through the platform.</p></blockquote>\n<p>23andMe's recent <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/genetic-testing-company-23andme-declares-bankruptcy/\">bankruptcy announcement</a> set off a wave of concern about the fate of genetic data for its 15 million customers.
