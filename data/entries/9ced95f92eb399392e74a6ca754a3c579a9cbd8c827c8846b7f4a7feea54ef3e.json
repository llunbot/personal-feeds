The report claims that 15-inch MacBook Air shipment volume in July has been 50% less than originally estimated amid a broader downturn in the notebook market.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/MacBook-Air-15-Inch-Feature-Blue.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"894\" />\r<br />\nAs a result of this \"poor start,\" the report claims that some Apple suppliers have requested a reduction in 15-inch MacBook Air shipments.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/apple-new-15-inch-macbook-air/\">Launched at WWDC last month</a>, the 15-inch MacBook Air starts at $1,299 and has the same design and M2 chip as the 13-inch model, but with a larger display and two extra speakers. It is the first time that Apple has offered a 15-inch display for the MacBook Air, which was previously only available in 13-inch and discontinued 11-inch size options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's unclear if 15-inch MacBook Air demand has met Apple's own internal expectations so far. Apple is set to report its third quarter earnings results <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/10/apple-announces-q3-2023-earnings-results-date/\">on August 3</a>, and it may share some comments about the laptop then. Other new Macs launched during the quarter included spec-bumped Mac Studio and Mac Pro models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe report claims that the MacBook supply chain can look forward to the \"upcoming announcement\" of a new MacBook Pro, without providing any additional details. The publication previously claimed that Apple plans to release a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/3nm-macbook-pro-reportedly-launching-in-2023/\">new 13-inch MacBook Pro with an M3 chip</a> later this year. The M3 chip is widely expected to be fabricated with TSMC's 3nm process for significant performance and power efficiency improvements compared to the 5nm-based M2 chip in the existing 13-inch MacBook Pro.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/26/15-inch-macbook-air-weaker-demand-report/\">15-Inch MacBook Air Demand Reportedly 'Weaker Than Expected' So Far</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/15-inch-macbook-air-demand-reportedly-weaker-than-expected-so-far.2396956/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9ced95f92eb399392e74a6ca754a3c579a9cbd8c827c8846b7f4a7feea54ef3e","category":"Apple"}
