Andrew shares with us some beautiful photos and a complete build spec so read on below for more!</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>I wanted to submit some pictures of my hand-made bike. This bike was hand-built in Richmond, VA, the USA by Gary, the one-man-show behind Våt Fot (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gary_fab/\" target=\"_blank\">@gary_fab</a>) and assembled by me (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mandrew_artinek/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@mandrew_artinek</a>). Gary and I started chatting about geometry and what I wanted out of this bike in October of 2020 and the frame was painted and ready to build by March of 2021.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/IMG_8982-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Gary was kind enough to prep and paint the bike while his hands were in bandages following a 40 mph collision with a deer while he was riding the gravel roads of the Shenandoah Valley here in Virginia.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/IMG_8979-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This bike has been a blast to ride on the gravel roads of Virginia and has also been raced in a few early season crits with a simple swap of the wheels. It’s probably the best bike I’ve ever ridden and I’m looking forward to many more miles on this versatile rig!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/IMG_8980-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /> <img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/IMG_8978-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The photographer behind these beautiful snaps is Grant, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gratstagram/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@gratstagram</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/IMG_8976-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Specs:</p>\n<p>Frame: Våt Fot</p>\n<p>Fork: Enve Adventure</p>\n<p>Headset: Chris King Black and Gold</p>\n<p>Hubs: Chris King Black and Gold</p>\n<p>Bottom Bracket: Chris King Black and Gold</p>\n<p>Chain: Wipperman Connex Black and Gold</p>\n<p>Rims: Whisky No.9 30w</p>\n<p>Seatpost: Thomson Elite</p>\n<p>Saddle: Fizik Tempo Argo</p>\n<p>Cranks: Race Face w/ 42 tooth Wolf Tooth Chainring</p>\n<p>Tires: Maxxis Rambler (45mm front, 40mm rear)</p>\n<p>Drivetrain: SRAM Rival (10-42 cassette)</p>\n<div>\n<p>____</p>\n<p>We’d like to thank all of you who have <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared over here.
