Lighter, thinner, more aero, more precise, and able to fit on more bikes with its thinner construction and still entirely made in Spain. Mix and match carbon or alloy cranks, 24mm or 30mm BBs, and either round or oval 1x or 2x chainrings to suit any dropbar setup from road to triathlon to gravel…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Revamped modular Rotor INspider Road power meter</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rotor’s modular direct-mount spider-based INspider power meter has been around <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rotor-1x13-hydraulic-mountain-bike-group-is-here-plus-inspider-power-meter-debut/\" target=\"_blank\">since late 2019</a> to <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/remote-otter-rotor-unveils-kapic-carbon-cranks-inspider-power-meter-more/\" target=\"_blank\">early 2020</a>, and frankly this new Road iteration looks almost the same at first glance. But a closer look reveals that pretty much everything inside has been updated. And this new version is much better in almost every way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s new?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-Rotor-INspider-Road-power-meter-updated_angled.webp\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-Rotor-INspider-Road-power-meter-updated_angled.webp\" alt=\"updated Rotor INspider Road power meter is lighter, smarter, more aero &amp; cheaper, and fits more road &amp; gravel bikes, angled \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-Rotor-INspider-Road-power-meter-updated_angled.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-Rotor-INspider-Road-power-meter-updated_angled-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-Rotor-INspider-Road-power-meter-updated_angled-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-Rotor-INspider-Road-power-meter-updated_angled-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos/Rotor)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At 128g for the spider alone, that’s a 21-28g weight savings. And it is half as thick, now just 12mm overall. That of course helped with weight reduction, but also reduced area into the wind, making it more aero, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-Rotor-INspider-Road-power-meter-updated_now-thinner-and-more-aero-too.webp\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-Rotor-INspider-Road-power-meter-updated_now-thinner-and-more-aero-too.webp\" alt=\"updated Rotor INspider Road power meter is lighter, smarter, more aero &amp; cheaper, and fits more road &amp; gravel bikes - thinner \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-Rotor-INspider-Road-power-meter-updated_now-thinner-and-more-aero-too.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-Rotor-INspider-Road-power-meter-updated_now-thinner-and-more-aero-too-297x79.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-Rotor-INspider-Road-power-meter-updated_now-thinner-and-more-aero-too-120x32.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-Rotor-INspider-Road-power-meter-updated_now-thinner-and-more-aero-too-768x205.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That also helps with universal fit. Rotor says the new INspider Road is compatible with pretty much all PressFit BB standards, BSA threaded, and now T47, as well. Plus, their compatible modular crankarms that can be fitted to the new spider power meter are available to fit either 30mm or 24mm axles, to really fit just about every bike at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-Rotor-INspider-Road-power-meter-updated_lighter-cheaper-more-versatile_spindle-options.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-Rotor-INspider-Road-power-meter-updated_lighter-cheaper-more-versatile_spindle-options.webp\" alt=\"updated Rotor INspider Road power meter is lighter, smarter, more aero &amp; cheaper, and fits more road &amp; gravel bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-Rotor-INspider-Road-power-meter-updated_lighter-cheaper-more-versatile_spindle-options.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-Rotor-INspider-Road-power-meter-updated_lighter-cheaper-more-versatile_spindle-options-297x87.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-Rotor-INspider-Road-power-meter-updated_lighter-cheaper-more-versatile_spindle-options-120x35.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-Rotor-INspider-Road-power-meter-updated_lighter-cheaper-more-versatile_spindle-options-768x224.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From a power measurement standpoint, INspider Road now has a claimed accuracy of +/-1.5%. We don’t really know how much more accurate that is than before, as Rotor used to be reluctant to make accuracy claims. But Rotor claims “enhanced precision and intelligence” because of updated electronics, now recording power 120x per second and outputting more data to your connected device. It also is said to pair faster and gets a 75% longer runtime, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, the old version was selling for 709€ just a week ago, and now this better one is just 599€.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tech details</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-Rotor-INspider-Road-power-meter-updated_exploded-view.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-Rotor-INspider-Road-power-meter-updated_exploded-view.webp\" alt=\"updated Rotor INspider Road power meter is lighter, smarter, more aero &amp;

But of course, you need a set of crankarms and chainrings to ride with it (but probably the same BB already in your bike). Officially, Rotor says this is compatible with their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rotor-aldhu-carbon-crankset-adds-ultralight-option-to-modular-drivetrain-system/\" target=\"_blank\">Aldhu Carbon</a> or alloy <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rotor-aldhu-ultralight-road-cranks-get-hidden-powermeter-option-track-spindle/\" target=\"_blank\">Aldhu</a> or <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/affordable-light-modular-rotor-vegast-24-all-road-cranks-expand-to-fit-every-bb/\" target=\"_blank\">Vegast</a> crankarms because of the OCP direct mount interface. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/QO-30-carbon-gravel-crankset-with-OCP-compatability.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/QO-30-carbon-gravel-crankset-with-OCP-compatability.webp\" alt=\"QO 30 carbon gravel cranks should also be compatible\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/QO-30-carbon-gravel-crankset-with-OCP-compatability.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/QO-30-carbon-gravel-crankset-with-OCP-compatability-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/QO-30-carbon-gravel-crankset-with-OCP-compatability-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/QO-30-carbon-gravel-crankset-with-OCP-compatability-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/QO-30-carbon-gravel-crankset-with-OCP-compatability-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/QO-30-carbon-gravel-crankset-with-OCP-compatability-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>possible Qo compatibility, too? <em>(Photo/Qo)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But it looks like you could <em>maybe</em> mount it to one of Qo’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/qo-carbon-cranks-launch-new-road-gravel-mtb-components-from-founders-of-rotor/\" target=\"_blank\">new carbon road or gravel cranksets</a> that appear to use the same 45-tooth DIN spline.
