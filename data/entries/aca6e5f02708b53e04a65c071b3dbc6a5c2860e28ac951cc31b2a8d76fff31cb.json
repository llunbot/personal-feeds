This decline resulted in a 17.1% market share for the company, placing it behind Huawei and Xiaomi, which captured 18.1% and 17.2% of the market, respectively. The fall comes just a year after Apple held the top position in the market with a 19% share. This is apparently the first time since the U.S. ban on Huawei that Apple has been displaced by its Chinese competitor.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's reduced performance in China has been attributed to several factors, including heightened competition from domestic brands and its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/apple-struggling-to-adapt-ai-for-china/\">inability to bring Apple Intelligence to the region</a>. While <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> was introduced alongside the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> lineup in September 2024 in the United States, it has not been made available in China due to regulatory constraints. The company is believed to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/apple-ai-partner-china/\">partnering with Chinese companies</a> to deliver the features at a later date. Huawei's strong growth in the fourth quarter—up 15.5% year-on-year—has been largely credited to AI features in its flagship Mate 70 devices and the mid-range Nova 13 series.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is also of note that China's smartphone market experienced a 3.2% year-on-year decline in the fourth quarter of 2024, marking the only quarter of the year with negative growth. Despite these obstacles, Apple maintained its position as the third-largest smartphone brand in China for the quarter, and its sales were closely matched with Xiaomi, which recorded a 17.2% market share. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/counterpoint/\">Counterpoint</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/apple-falls-to-third-place-in-china/\">Apple Falls to Third Place in China's Smartphone Market Amid Sales Decline</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-falls-to-third-place-in-chinas-smartphone-market-amid-sales-decline.2447818/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aca6e5f02708b53e04a65c071b3dbc6a5c2860e28ac951cc31b2a8d76fff31cb","category":"Apple"}
