Hockey, maple syrup, flannel shirts, and genuine politeness are some of the things that come to mind when I think about Canada. Stereotypes often exist for a reason, or maybe I’ve just listened to “<em>Out for a Rip</em>” by Shark Tank a few too many times (<em>look it up on YouTube, and you can thank me later</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless we’re talking about bikes, of course, then it’s got to be Rocky Mountain. For more than 40 years, Rocky Mountain has been developing mountain bikes on Vancouver’s iconic North Shore. With a heavy use of maple leaves and mountain peaks in its graphics and a team of rugged Canadian racers and freeriders, Rocky Mountain is as Canadian as poutine to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the brand’s history may be rich and its legacy firmly intact, Rocky Mountain’s future has been anything but certain. Back in December, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rocky-mountain-bicycles-files-for-pandemic-fueled-business-restructure/\">Ron reported on the brand’s announcement</a> of application for restructuring in an effort to “become a resilient and successful long-term business.” That was a bit scary to read for fans of the brand. But like many brands in the bike industry, the pandemic was tough on Rocky Mountain, and restructuring was a necessity to stay afloat.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rocky Mountain’s New Owners: Still Canadian</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rocky-Mountain-ownership-screenshot.webp\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rocky-Mountain-ownership-screenshot.webp\" alt=\"Screenshot from the Rocky Mountain site's new ownership announcement. \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rocky-Mountain-ownership-screenshot.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rocky-Mountain-ownership-screenshot-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rocky-Mountain-ownership-screenshot-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rocky-Mountain-ownership-screenshot-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rocky-Mountain-ownership-screenshot-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rocky-Mountain-ownership-screenshot-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos/Rocky Mountain)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On May 9th, Rocky Mountain announced the beginning of a new chapter as ownership transitions to a group of four Canadian Investors known collectively as Chaos Sports, Inc. According to their press release, “<em>The new ownership team brings diverse expertise, a shared love of cycling and the outdoors, and a clear commitment to growing Rocky Mountain while staying true to its DNA.</em>”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three members of the new ownership team are involved with Maui Bikes, an electric bike company based in Quebec. According to Rocky Mountain’s website, the team has “a clear vision for what’s next.” That includes resuming its R&amp;D works in North Vancouver, where it started more than 4 decades ago. Hopefully, this includes hiring back staff who were laid off during the restructuring process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the announcement, the Chaos Sports. Inc. team includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Jonathan Bourgeois</strong>, co-founder of Raccoon Skis and partner at Maui Bikes, brings hands-on experience, an innovative mindset, and a deep connection to outdoor culture.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><em><strong>Christian Thibert</strong>, President of Thibert Inc. – a North American leader in distribution – brings a focus on innovation, customer service excellence, and strategic partnerships. His long-term vision is aligned with Rocky Mountain’s repositioning efforts.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><em><strong>Patrick St-Denis</strong>, with a background at Oakley and The North Face, offers keen consumer insight and strong expertise in brand strategy.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><em><strong>Jean-François Grenache</strong>, a marketing and business development specialist, is known for revitalizing brands in complex market environments.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Patrick St-Denis, spokesperson for the Chaos Sports, Inc. team, had this to say: “<em>Rocky Mountain is more than just a name — it’s a mindset, a culture, a way of experiencing the ride. We’re stepping in with humility, energy, and determination. Our goal is clear: to honour what has made Rocky strong for over 40 years and to open a new chapter of growth</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Continued Service and Warranty Support</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rocky-Mountain-Restucturing-trail-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rocky-Mountain-Restucturing-trail-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"A mountain biker riding down a scenic trail on a Rocky Mountain Bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rocky-Mountain-Restucturing-trail-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rocky-Mountain-Restucturing-trail-jpeg-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rocky-Mountain-Restucturing-trail-jpeg-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rocky-Mountain-Restucturing-trail-jpeg-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rocky-Mountain-Restucturing-trail-jpeg-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rocky-Mountain-Restucturing-trail-jpeg-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>We’re hoping for sunny days ahead for Rocky Mountain (<em>Photo/Rocky Mountain</em>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From the press release: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>The 2025–2026 period will mark a strategic relaunch, with the ambition of establishing Rocky Mountain as a global leader in mountain biking. The new owners are committed to upholding the highest standards of quality, service, and support.

Several brands have closed their doors, while others have been bought up by faceless holding companies and private equity firms. Last year, Kona abruptly took down its booth at the Sea Otter Classic but has since been <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/kona-buys-brand-back-from-kent-outdoors/\" target=\"_blank\">bought back by its former owners</a> and has been producing new models. Just last month, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/revel-bikes-is-apparently-closing-just-after-launching-three-new-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">Revel announced it was shutting down</a>, just after launching three new models at the Sea Otter Classic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The list goes on…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What the future holds for Rocky Mountain is still unclear, but this news certainly gives me hope of a clear trail ahead. We’re all hopeful that the new owners can breathe new life into this iconic brand while staying true to its Canadian roots and making the future less rocky for Rocky Mountain Bicycles. Because if there’s one thing I want to continue to associate with Canada as much as French fries covered in gravy and cheese curds, it’s Rocky Mountain Bicycles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and let’s not forget that Rocky Mountain has the best URL in the business. Let’s hope that one stays strong!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Bikes.com</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rocky-mountain-is-still-canadian-owned/\">Rocky Mountain is Still Canadian-Owned</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jeremy Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"05e71cb557aee2f3abb56c801d6e1d5609b134a4c476593b1d0f7adc8d126b67","category":"Cycling"}
