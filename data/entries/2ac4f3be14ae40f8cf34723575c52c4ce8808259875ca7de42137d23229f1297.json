An incident report <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-leaker-arrested-after-stealing-and-allegedly-trying-to-sell-copies-of-bethesdas-rpg\">obtained by IGN</a> reportedly lists the stolen property in question as \"Video Game: Microsoft Starfield unreleased game.\"</p>\n<p>The arrest came days after the YouTube account \"DHavenShadow,\" which apparently belongs to Harris, posted roughly 40 minutes of <em>Starfield</em> gameplay (seemingly captured from a cell phone pointed at a TV) to YouTube and other social media channels on August 22 (a spoiler-free listing for one such video can be seen in <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230822080535/https://www.youtube.com/@Memphian94\">this Internet Archive capture</a>). While the video was quickly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qzZ6ORZCcg&amp;t=3s\">taken down from YouTube</a> by a ZeniMax Media copyright claim, copies of the same content spread across the Internet quicker than they could be taken down. The footage reportedly got over 1 million views on Imgur alone before <a href=\"https://imgur.com/CpgX35T\">being taken down there as well</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1963719#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1963719&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2ac4f3be14ae40f8cf34723575c52c4ce8808259875ca7de42137d23229f1297","category":"Tech"}
