Gurman said the first Macs with the M3 chip will likely be the 13-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch MacBook Air, and 24-inch iMac, and the Mac mini and 15-inch MacBook Air should also be updated with the M3 chip eventually.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has yet to announce the M3 chip, which is widely expected to be manufactured with TSMC's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/\">3nm process</a> for significant performance and power efficiency improvements compared to previous M-series chips built on TSMC's 5nm process.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe A17 Bionic chip for the upcoming iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max is also expected to be manufactured with TSMC's 3nm process, and iPad Pro models with the M3 chip and an OLED display are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/07/ipad-pro-oled-display-mass-production-early-2024/\">rumored to launch in the first half of 2024</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/\">3nm</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/27/apple-suppliers-gearing-up-for-new-macs/\">Apple Suppliers Reportedly Gearing Up for New Macs Later This Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-suppliers-reportedly-gearing-up-for-new-macs-later-this-year.2397065/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f4101b7e8348b1797b4103f1634a8f9301a76bd05374e4f93ab786f567dc0879","category":"Apple"}
