But really, it sounds like a bit of a stretch to call a portable pressure washer something entirely new, right? I’ve already got one sitting in my mud room, right now. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Muc-Off portable rechargeable Mobile Bike Pressure Washer, contents\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But what Muc-Off has done is actually pretty new. They’ve created a compact and portable high-powered pressure washer tailored specifically for the needs of cyclists. That means it is powerful, but won’t blow the seals off your bearings. And it includes the specialty Snow Foam Lance, which is simply a soap sprayer attachment that screws on a 1L bottle of their popular pink Nanotech cleaner to quickly coat your bike in fast-acting, mud-eating soap bubbles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why does a bike washer need to be mobile?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_cleanup-before-the-drive-home.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_cleanup-before-the-drive-home-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Muc-Off Mobile Bike Pressure Washer, portable rechargeable clean your bicycles anywhere machine, blast it clean before the drive home\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_cleanup-before-the-drive-home-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_cleanup-before-the-drive-home-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_cleanup-before-the-drive-home-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_cleanup-before-the-drive-home-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_cleanup-before-the-drive-home-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_cleanup-before-the-drive-home-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_cleanup-before-the-drive-home.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Where do I most often clean my bike? At home. Do I have power and water at home? Yes. But as a cyclist, I also lived for two decades in an apartment that did not have easy outside power and water access. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even now, I feel like I most often clean my bike in the coldest, wettest months. And that’s when I either have the outside faucet shut down so it doesn’t freeze in the winter. Or I would much prefer to clean my bike outside with warm water. And I do not have hot water on tap on the outside of my house. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, sometimes I travel to ride muddy trails far from home. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_blasting-gravel-and-cyclocross-bikes-too.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_blasting-gravel-and-cyclocross-bikes-too-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Muc-Off Mobile Bike Pressure Washer, portable rechargeable clean your bicycles anywhere machine, for gravel and cyclocross too\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_blasting-gravel-and-cyclocross-bikes-too-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_blasting-gravel-and-cyclocross-bikes-too-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_blasting-gravel-and-cyclocross-bikes-too-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_blasting-gravel-and-cyclocross-bikes-too-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_blasting-gravel-and-cyclocross-bikes-too-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_blasting-gravel-and-cyclocross-bikes-too-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_blasting-gravel-and-cyclocross-bikes-too.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And it’s super nice to blast most mud off bikes before packing back into the car/van for the drive home. I also know many people who live &amp; ride in sensitive forest ecosystems. Where they clean bikes at the end of every ride away from home, lest they bring back something on their tires that could damage their local natural environment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep your mud at the trail.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_extra-portable.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_extra-portable-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"Muc-Off portable rechargeable Mobile Bike Pressure Washer\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_extra-portable-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_extra-portable-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_extra-portable-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_extra-portable-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_extra-portable.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Muc-Off mobile pressure washer is powered by a cordless drill style 40v x 2.5Ah (90Wh) lithium-ion rechargeable battery. Which Muc-Off says will run for a full 24 minutes of continuous cleaning time in Eco mode (15 mins in Boost mode). And it recharges in 3-4 hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_40v-battery.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_40v-battery-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Muc-Off portable rechargeable Mobile Bike Pressure Washer, powered by 40V cordless drill batteries\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_40v-battery-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_40v-battery-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_40v-battery-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_40v-battery-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_40v-battery-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_40v-battery-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_40v-battery.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The pressure washer itself is driven by a 500W brushless motor, which puts out a max 942.5psi water pressure in Boost mode. That’s 2x as powerful as other portable pressure washers, according to Muc-Off. So it should get all the gunk off your bike. All that in a IPX5-rated case that won’t mind if you spray more than your bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_high-pressure-jey-wash-cleaning.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_high-pressure-jey-wash-cleaning-1536x864.jpg\" alt=\"Muc-Off portable rechargeable Mobile Bike Pressure Washer, high-pressure jet wash for bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_high-pressure-jey-wash-cleaning-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_high-pressure-jey-wash-cleaning-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_high-pressure-jey-wash-cleaning-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_high-pressure-jey-wash-cleaning-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_high-pressure-jey-wash-cleaning-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_high-pressure-jey-wash-cleaning.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Output Pressure:</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Standard Mode: 45 Bar (652psi)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Eco Mode: 35 Bar (507psi)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Max Pressure: 65 Bar (942psi)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Output Water Flow:</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Boost Mode: 3.3 L/min</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Eco Mode: 2.5 L/min</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Max Flow: 4.0 L/min</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_same-attachments-as-the-original.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_same-attachments-as-the-original-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Muc-Off portable rechargeable Mobile Bike Pressure Washer, lot of spray nozzles\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_same-attachments-as-the-original-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_same-attachments-as-the-original-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_same-attachments-as-the-original-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_same-attachments-as-the-original-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_same-attachments-as-the-original-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_same-attachments-as-the-original-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Muc-Off-Mobile-Bike-Pressure-Washer_rechargeable-clean-your-bicycles-anywhere_same-attachments-as-the-original.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mobile Bike Pressure Washer has a built-in 20L water tank, with an integrated water filter.
