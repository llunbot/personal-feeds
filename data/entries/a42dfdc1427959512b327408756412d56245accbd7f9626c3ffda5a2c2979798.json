Their new HALO lineup brings that to your workshop, along with claims of reduced friction, water resistance, longevity, reduced mechanical wear, and dirt<br />defense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, they do it with a PFAS-free, biodegradable formula that won’t hurt the environment.

Three main ingredients set it apart and help it perform. First, highly-refined paraffin wax coats the chain with a dry-to-the-touch film that repels moisture and sloughs off dirt and grit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, micron-sized spherical tungsten tubes reduce friction by effectively rolling between the surfaces of chain plates, chainrings, and cogs. Third, ceramic boron nitride platelets form a non-stick coating to keep the tungsten on board so it lasts longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first application should be on a completely clean, degreased chain and allowed to dry completely (they recommend 6-12 hours). Subsequent coats can be applied over that, just wipe off any surface contamination. You can also use it to top off the…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>HALO Hot Wax</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/finish-line-halo-wax-lubes-6.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/finish-line-halo-wax-lubes-6.jpg\" alt=\"finish line halo hot melt chain wax with dipping tool.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/finish-line-halo-wax-lubes-6.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/finish-line-halo-wax-lubes-6-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/finish-line-halo-wax-lubes-6-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/finish-line-halo-wax-lubes-6-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/finish-line-halo-wax-lubes-6-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/finish-line-halo-wax-lubes-6-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The HALO Hot Wax comes in a 600g bag that you place directly into a pot of boiling water (or you can pour the pellets directly into your slow cooker…but why?). It includes an “immersion tool” that you use to hang your chain on, dip it into the melted wax, then keep it hanging for 30 minutes until the wax fully dries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has the same three performance ingredients as the liquid lube, but fully immerses your chain so the lube gets into all of the nooks and crannies. MSRP is $39.99.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HALO Wet Lube</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/finish-line-halo-wet-chain-lube-5.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/finish-line-halo-wet-chain-lube-5.jpg\" alt=\"finish line halo wet lube for bike chains.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/finish-line-halo-wet-chain-lube-5.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/finish-line-halo-wet-chain-lube-5-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/finish-line-halo-wet-chain-lube-5-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/finish-line-halo-wet-chain-lube-5-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/finish-line-halo-wet-chain-lube-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/finish-line-halo-wet-chain-lube-5-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/finish-line-halo-wet-chain-lube-5-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s the new HALO Wet Lube, which swaps the paraffin wax for a hydrodynamic fluid film synthesized from natural gas. It includes the same spherical tungsten and ceramic platelets, so it provides most of the same benefits as the wax lubes but won’t repel and shed dirt and grit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They say it dramatically reduces friction, repels water, and works in extreme temperatures. They also say oil-based lubes have less total friction, handle extreme pressure better, and are quieter, but have that little problem with attracting dust. So it makes a great race day lube when you need the ultimate performance, as long as conditions aren’t too dusty or the race isn’t too long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes in a 4oz bottle for $29.99. All three are non-toxic and non-flammable, making them safe for air travel (and humans).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.finishlineusa.com\" target=\"_blank\">FinishLineUSA.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/finish-line-halo-wax-chain-lubes/\">Finish Line HALO Wax Lubes Promise Faster for Longer</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"a42dfdc1427959512b327408756412d56245accbd7f9626c3ffda5a2c2979798","category":"Cycling"}
