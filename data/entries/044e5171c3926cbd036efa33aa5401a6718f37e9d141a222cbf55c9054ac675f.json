This shift was more than a change in job title; it was a significant transformation that leveraged my hands-on technical experience to solve broader business challenges. In this blog post, I'd like to share how my journey unfolded, the importance of mentorship, and how my practitioner background became an invaluable asset in my new role.</p>\n\n<h2>The DevOps years: Driving organizational change</h2>\n\n<p>My early career was deeply rooted in the technical trenches of a legacy IT organization going through a modernization effort, but it was also a period where I became an agent of organizational change. When I joined the <strong>California Department of Transportation</strong>, there was a broken Configuration Management Database (CMDB). ServiceNow was newly acquired, and processes for automation and integration were broken. By the time I left, we had transformed these critical areas, leading to significant positive changes within the organization.</p>\n\n<h3>Key achievements:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Became a change agent:</strong> I championed and led the district implementation of ServiceNow CMDB. This centralized system streamlined asset management and improved efficiency. I also collaborated with cross-functional teams to redesign the change control process. This reduced system downtime and improved compliance with regulatory standards.</li>\n<li><strong>Standardizing practices:</strong> I authored best practices for web applications and SQL databases, ensuring consistency and security across applications.</li>\n<li><strong>Automating workflows:</strong> I established a DevOps team culture to automate workflows, improving deployment frequency.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These experiences were critical in understanding how IT organizations use technology to deliver value to their customers. I wasn't just implementing technical solutions, I was aligning technology with business objectives to drive tangible results and taking ownership of cultural change within the organization.</p>\n\n<h2>The importance of mentorship and seizing opportunities</h2>\n\n<p>One of the pivotal factors in my career progression has been the mentorship I received along the way. I've been fortunate to work with leaders who recognized my potential and provided opportunities for growth. Transitions don't happen in isolation, they require leaders who are willing to take chances on people.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kevin Ross:</strong> As my manager when I was a system administrator, Kevin allowed me to grow by involving me in business-level initiatives on the networking and infrastructure side. His trust and willingness to delegate important tasks gave me the confidence and experience needed to tackle complex challenges.</li>\n<li><strong>John Ramirez:</strong> As an automation and integration lead, John empowered me to foster an environment where DevOps practices could thrive. His support was instrumental in creating a culture of innovation and continuous improvement within our team.</li>\n<li><strong>Joe Colandro:</strong> At HashiCorp, Joe took a chance on me by facilitating my transition into the Solutions Engineer role. His belief in my abilities made this significant career shift possible. Without leaders like Joe who are willing to invest in people, such transitions might remain out of reach.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These mentors didn't just provide opportunities; they cultivated an environment that promoted growth for those willing to put in the effort and ask for the chance to prove themselves.</p>\n\n<h2>Recognizing the value of industry experience</h2>\n\n<p>As I contemplated the next step in my career, I realized that my deep technical background and experience in driving organizational change gave me a unique perspective. Transitioning to a solutions engineer role felt like a natural progression. My industry experience made it easier to understand my customers' challenges because I'd faced similar issues myself.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most interesting things I learned was that business and technical challenges are remarkably similar across different industries. Whether in transportation, government, or the private sector, organizations grapple with issues like scalability, security, operational efficiency, and cultural change.</p>\n\n<h2>Transitioning to solutions engineering: Bridging two worlds</h2>\n\n<p>Joining HashiCorp was a perfect fit. I was already on the path of using their technology in my previous roles, and their focus on infrastructure automation and cloud solutions aligned perfectly with my expertise.</p>\n\n<p>In my role as a Senior Solutions Engineer, I found that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Understanding customer needs is key:</strong> Solutions engineering isn't just about being a technical expert. It's about understanding what the customer needs and delivering value through technology.</li>\n<li><strong>Industry experience matters:</strong> My background made it easier to relate to customers' challenges and propose practical solutions.</li>\n<li><strong>Cross-industry challenges are similar:</strong> The problems faced by organizations often transcend industry boundaries, making my broad experience valuable.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Overcoming challenges: Adjusting to the sales culture</h2>\n\n<p>Transitioning into a sales-oriented culture was one of the significant challenges I faced. The metrics of success shifted from technical milestones to sales targets and customer acquisition/consumption.</p>\n\n<p>To adapt, I:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Developed soft skills:</strong> Enhanced my communication and presentation abilities to better articulate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.</li>\n<li><strong>Embraced the sales process:</strong> Learned <a href=\"https://qwilr.com/blog/meddpicc-methodology/\">MEDDPIC</a> to align with the sales culture.</li>\n<li><strong>Balanced tech and business:</strong> Strived to maintain my technical edge while also understanding the business implications of the solutions I proposed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The rewards of bridging the gap</h2>\n\n<p>The move has been incredibly rewarding:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Greater impact:</strong> Leveraging my practitioner background allows me to offer practical, real-world solutions that resonate with customers.</li>\n<li><strong>Professional growth:</strong> I've grown not just as a technologist but as a strategic thinker who can bridge the gap between technology and business needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Fulfillment:</strong> Helping organizations solve complex problems brings a sense of accomplishment that goes beyond technical achievements.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Transitioning from a practitioner to a solutions engineer has been a transformative experience that underscored the value of mentorship and seizing opportunities. Being part of organizations that promote growth, provided you're willing to put in the effort and ask for opportunities, makes all the difference. Leaders who are willing to take chances on people play a crucial role in facilitating such transitions.</p>\n\n<p>For those considering a similar path, remember that your hands-on experience is a powerful tool in bridging technical and business worlds. Seek out mentors, embrace opportunities, and don't hesitate to step out of your comfort zone. While adjusting to a sales culture can be challenging, the opportunity to make a broader impact is well worth the effort.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>What's next?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>I look forward to continuing to help organizations navigate their technological challenges by leveraging both my technical expertise and understanding of business needs.
