But Apple is wasting no time going from the version of visionOS that comes with the device (already <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2224566/vision-pro-visionos-1-0-2-update-webkit-zero-day-security-flaw.html\">updated to 1.02</a>) to the next significant revision. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We expect visionOS 1.1 to include features primarily aimed at app developers, though we know it will include MDM (Mobile Device Management) for business device management and might include other user-facing features as well. We don’t know when to expect a final release of visionOS 1.1, though late February or early March seems like a good bet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s new in visionOS 1.1</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MDM (Mobile Device Management):</strong> Businesses will find it easier to manage workplace users with support for account-driven enrollment, app installation, Managed Apple IDs, network configurations, single sign-on, support for Exchange and Google Workspace, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reset device:</strong> If you forget your Vision Pro passcode, you need to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2228718/vision-pro-passcode-reset-apple-store-support.html\">take it to an Apple Store</a> for them to reset the device. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/06/visionos-1-1-beta-reset-password/&amp;xcust=1-1-2228964-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">9to5Mac</a> has discovered code to suggest that users will be able to reset their device after multiple failed password attempts. Activation Lock is still active, meaning it can only be set up again with the Apple ID and password used before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>App placement:</strong> Users will now be able to reposition volumetric scenes much closer than before, according to Apple’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos-release-notes/visionos-1_1-release-notes#Control-Center&amp;xcust=1-1-2228964-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">release notes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>visionOS 1.1: How to install the public beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re not sure if Apple will have a public beta program for visionOS yet—there’s no Public Beta option yet, but the device is brand new. We expect it would work like it does on other Apple devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll probably join the beta by opening <em>Settings</em>, selecting <em>General</em>, then <em>Software Updates</em>. In the Beta Updates section, choose <em>visionOS Public Beta</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>visionOS 1.1: How to install the developer beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll need to be registered as an Apple developer, but you don’t need to be in the $99 per year developer program to access the developer beta; a free developer account will do. You can get one via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-developer/id640199958&amp;xcust=1-1-2228964-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Developer App</a> from the App Store.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on Account.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sign in using your usual Apple ID.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>On your Apple Vision Pro, open <em>Settings</em>, choose <em>General</em>, then <em>Software Update</em>. In the Beta Updates menu, select <em>visionOS Devleoper Beta</em>.</p>\n\nVirtual Reality</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"361013f67c1de20320f000f0ba749ff76d198a7a760c8520e266a67a9d29885f","category":"Apple"}
