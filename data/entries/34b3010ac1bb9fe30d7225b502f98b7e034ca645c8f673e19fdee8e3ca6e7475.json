We observed that the phones could run hot while working on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/iphone-15-and-15-pro-review-the-final-form/\">our review</a>, \"sometimes to the point that they were uncomfortable to hold without a case,\" and other reviewers and users have noticed the issue as well.</p>\n<p>The problem is real and serious enough to have merited an official response from Apple over the weekend, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-responds-to-iphone-15-pro-overheating/\">shared with MacRumors</a> and other outlets. Apple says the main culprit at first is \"increased background activity\" that occurs as users set up their new phones for the first time (which I've also noticed in other iPhones and iPads and is pretty typical).</p>\n\n<p>But Apple also says it has identified \"a bug in iOS 17 that is impacting some users\" and that specific apps like Uber, Instagram, and the game <em>Asphalt 9: Legends</em> are all \"overload[ing] the system\" and causing heat problems. The company is working with those apps' developers on fixes that will be distributed via the App Store.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972440#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972440&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"34b3010ac1bb9fe30d7225b502f98b7e034ca645c8f673e19fdee8e3ca6e7475","category":"Tech"}
