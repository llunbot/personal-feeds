{"title":"HCP Packer adds bucket-level RBAC","link":"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hcp-packer-adds-bucket-level-rbac","date":1720540800000,"content":"<p>We are excited to announce that <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/products/packer\">HCP Packer</a> has released a new enhancement to its role-based access control (RBAC): bucket-level RBAC. With this new feature, organizations gain further control over their permissions management to mitigate security risks and practice the principle of least privilege.</p>\n\n<h2>Access management challenges</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.packer.io/\">HashiCorp Packer</a> automates the process of building system and container images from a single source configuration. HCP Packer is a service that builds on Packer, enabling platform teams to manage and standardize the lifecycle of image artifacts across different clouds or on-premises environments. </p>\n\n<p>In HCP Packer, users organize their images using <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/packer/store/create-bucket\">buckets</a>, which serve as a repository to store metadata for specific artifact versions. Previously, HCP Packer access roles could be defined only at the <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/orgs\">organizational</a> or <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects\">project</a> level, which presented challenges for teams trying to strengthen security with a more-granular approach to access management. </p>\n\n<p>Limited RBAC options meant admins might grant project access to individuals who didn’t fully require such permissions, resulting in a potential misalignment with their security and compliance policies. To avoid that situation, admins might have had to set up a separate project, adding further complexity to their image workflows and slowing down their development teams. Getting around this limitation called for a more tiered approach to access control in HCP Packer.</p>\n\n<h2>Enabling granular access control</h2>\n\n<p>With the latest release, HCP Packer users can now define user access at the bucket level. With this, developers can create buckets within the same project to gain functionality like <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/packer/manage/ancestry\">ancestry tracking</a> and multi-level <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/packer/manage/revoke-restore\">revocation</a> without needing full project access. Admins can now assign specific permission at the bucket level for actions such as creating, updating, and deleting artifact versions and more:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>Permissions</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Viewer</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Contributor</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Admin</strong>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>View bucket\n   </td>\n   <td>✅\n   </td>\n   <td>✅\n   </td>\n   <td>✅\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Delete bucket\n   </td>\n   <td>❌\n   </td>\n   <td>✅\n   </td>\n   <td>✅\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Create versions\n   </td>\n   <td>❌\n   </td>\n   <td>✅\n   </td>\n   <td>✅\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Update versions\n   </td>\n   <td>❌\n   </td>\n   <td>✅\n   </td>\n   <td>✅\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Delete versions\n   </td>\n   <td>❌\n   </td>\n   <td>✅\n   </td>\n   <td>✅\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Manage bucket service principals\n   </td>\n   <td>❌\n   </td>\n   <td>❌\n   </td>\n   <td>✅\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Edit bucket permissions\n   </td>\n   <td>❌\n   </td>\n   <td>❌\n   </td>\n   <td>✅\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Manage group role for bucket\n   </td>\n   <td>❌\n   </td>\n   <td>❌\n   </td>\n   <td>✅\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<p><em>Table shows the capabilities of viewer, contributor, and admin roles for HCP Packer buckets</em></p>\n\n<p>With this improvement, organizations can now ensure sensitive golden images remain protected from unauthorized modifications while giving developers the self-service capabilities they need to be agile and efficient.</p>\n\n<h2>Learn more</h2>\n\n<p>For details on bucket-level RBAC and how to start mitigating risk with access management, check out the <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/packer/reference/permissions\">HCP Packer permissions documentation</a>.
