The musician then sits beside an easel holding a Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra with musical notation on the screen, and proceeds to perform the piece of music. The video was <a href=\"https://x.com/SamsungMobileUS/status/1790824457365594487\">shared on X (Twitter)</a> by Samsung with the accompanying caption, \"We would never crush creativity.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSamsung mocking Apple in its ads is nothing new. The company has mocked Apple for everything from design decisions such as the iPhone's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/08/02/samsung-mocks-apple-headphone-jack-removal/\">removal of the headphone jack</a> (which it also eventually removed) to Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/15/samsung-foldable-iphone-world-cup-ad/\">lack of a foldable smartphone lineup</a>. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/16/samsung-trolls-apple-ipad-pro-crush-ad/\">Samsung Trolls iPad 'Crush!'
