{"title":"Jason Snell’s iPhone 13 Upgrader’s Guide","link":"https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/09/the-iphone-13-an-upgraders-guide/","date":1632949914000,"content":"\n<p>Jason Snell, Six Colors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The problem is that most people don’t buy a new iPhone every year.\nThe primary upgraders to the iPhone 13 will be coming from the\niPhone 7, or 8, or X, or XS, or XR. For them, several years of\nApple innovations will be rolled into a single purchase. But\nreviews of the new iPhones will not address what happened in 2018,\nor 2019, or 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s an attempt to provide a little more of a big-picture\noverview for owners of older iPhones who are wondering what’s new\nin the iPhone 13. I’ve simplified matter a little — if you own a\n“plus” or “max” model of iPhone, obviously your phone will be a\nlittle larger, and you may want to consider the direct upgrade to\nthe iPhone 13 Pro Max to continue with your large phone. The\niPhone 13 mini is also a great option for those who prefer a\nsmaller phone with all the same power as the larger iPhone 13.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a fantastic idea. You just scroll down to whatever iPhone you’re currently using, and boom, there’s a list of the top upgrades you’d experience if you upgrade to an iPhone 13. Apple’s excellent <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/\">iPhone Compare page</a> has all this information, but the Compare page also tells you everything that’s the same or roughly equivalent between models. Snell’s guide focuses on the big changes from iPhone Old and iPhone New.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/29/snell-iphone-13-upgraders-guide\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"54f702dc62d19885776b62b9e939440469294b1c1713ef6efe7d221c835e179c","category":"Tech"}
