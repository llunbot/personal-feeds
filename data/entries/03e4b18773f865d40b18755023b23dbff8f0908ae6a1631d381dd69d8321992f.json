Two of these issues were addressed in the prior iOS 16.4.1 and macOS 13.3.1 Rapid Security Response updates and are not an issue if you updated, but a third vulnerability is still active until you install the latest updates.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe WebKit security flaw could allow an attacker to break out of the Web Content sandbox, an issue that Apple fixed with improved bounds checks. Apple says that it is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe other two WebKit vulnerabilities were related to processing maliciously crafted web content that could allow for the disclosure of sensitive information or arbitrary code execution.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/\">iOS 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-16/\">iPadOS 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-13/\">macOS Ventura</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-16.238\">iOS 16</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-ventura.239\">macOS Ventura</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/18/ios-16-5-macos-13-4-vulnerabilty-fixes/\">PSA: Make Sure to Update, iOS 16.5, iPadOS 16.5, and macOS 13.4 Address These Three Actively Exploited Vulnerabilities</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/psa-make-sure-to-update-ios-16-5-ipados-16-5-and-macos-13-4-address-these-three-actively-exploited-vulnerabilities.2389912/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"03e4b18773f865d40b18755023b23dbff8f0908ae6a1631d381dd69d8321992f","category":"Apple"}
