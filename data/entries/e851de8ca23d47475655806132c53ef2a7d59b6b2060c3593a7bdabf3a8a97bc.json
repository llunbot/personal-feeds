{"title":"iPhone 15 Pro Max: One Year Review","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/21/iphone-15-pro-max-one-year-review/","date":1724262810000,"content":"It's been almost a year since the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> models were released, so <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera decided to do a one-year check-in review on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max to see how it's performed over the last 12 months.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\nUnsurprisingly, Dan has seen some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> battery degradation, and it's dropped to 89 percent. That's with regular <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a> usage, running betas, and standard day-to-day use. Even at 89 percent, the battery can still last for a full day without needing a charge.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for the titanium chassis, it's held up well. There are a few nicks due to minor drops, but the display has seen a lot more damage with several scratches, some of which are deep.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe transition to USB-C has been a little tough just because there are still people with Lightning iPhones. If someone wants to borrow your charger, you may not have the right cable if you've switched to USB-C and they're still on Lightning.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDan uses the Action Button for opening up the Camera app, but there's so much more that the Action Button can do in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, and it's going to get a lot more useful in the future. You can set Control Center controls to the Action Button, and developers can make new controls for apps that you can use.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's not too much to say about the triple-lens camera setup, which is great. The 5x zoom lens is excellent for taking portrait pictures of people, and it's been a solid improvement. Otherwise, the cameras are fantastic with a lot of focal length versatility thanks to the new zoom option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOverall, the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max has held up well, and if you have one (or a Pro), there's no real need to upgrade to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models. The A17 Pro in the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ is incredibly fast and there's no way most people are even reaching the limits of its capabilities at this time, and Apple isn't adding too much more than an extra Capture Button and a slightly larger display in 2024. You can already use Apple Intelligence if you have an ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ model, so there's not a lot to get out of a year-over-year upgrade.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you have an older ‌iPhone‌, it's worth looking at the ‌iPhone 16‌ models, or even an ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ when prices drop and they're discontinued. All of the ‌iPhone 16‌ models will have a chip compatible with Apple Intelligence, a Capture Button, and an Action Button, so there's a lot to gain coming from an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> or earlier.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHow has your ‌iPhone 15‌ held up if you have one?
