These prints are for the vintage aficionados, dirt freaks, parts bin pickers, and co-op combers, with lots of cycling ephemera represented by each of the letters of the alphabet. </p>\n<p>Here’s what Jeff has to say about these prints:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I started drawing the artwork for “Bike Part Alphabet” in March of 2020.  The idea for the print was to represent each letter of the alphabet with a bike part.</p></blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/JeffPrints-4.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/JeffPrints-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<blockquote><p>I started riding mountain bikes in the early ’90s and wanted to include as many parts from those early days.  My approach was to avoid using brands; however, there were a few letters that were challenging so I got creative with my own rule.</p></blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/JeffPrints-3.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/JeffPrints-6.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This is an open edition, 3 color silkscreen, printed on 19”x 25” 100# acid-free French Paper with Green Galaxy water-based inks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/JeffPrints-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>These prints are <a href=\"https://shop.theradavist.com/collections/accessories-1/products/prints-jeff-hantmans-cycling-alphabet-print\" target=\"_blank\">in stock now at the Radavist webshop</a> for $100 plus <strong>shipping to the United States</strong> only please!</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"cc1984e32e1a00366705cf27e629cd1fea2f213d104e37cc4c92ae4cd7cd722a","category":"Cycling"}
