{"title":"Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 No Longer Available From U.S. Online Store","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apple-watch-removed-from-online-store/","date":1703279326000,"content":"\n<p>Juli Clover, MacRumors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As promised, Apple today stopped selling the Apple Watch Series 9 \nand Apple Watch Ultra 2 in its online store in the United States, \nwith the devices pulled from sale just days ahead of when an Apple \nWatch import ban goes into effect. When attempting to purchase an \nApple Watch Series 9 or Apple Watch Ultra 2 to the online store, \nthe devices say “currently unavailable.” Apple has also removed \nrefurbished Apple Watch Series 7 and Series 8 models from its \nwebsite. [...] </p>\n\n<p>The Apple Watch is still available for purchase from Apple’s \nretail stores, but Apple will stop store sales after December 24. \nSales will be paused only in the United States and only at \nApple’s own retail locations. Third-party stores like Target, \nWalmart, and Best Buy can continue to sell the Apple Watch until \nsupplies run out. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-21/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-ban-means-no-repairs-on-out-of-warranty-models\">Mark Gurman, at Bloomberg</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After Dec. 25, Apple also won’t be able to exchange a watch \npurchased before the ban, say for a different color or size, \nduring the typical return period. Retail staff was told a product \nswap won’t be allowed, but Apple will replace accessories like \nbands. Watches can still be returned for a refund. </p>\n\n<p>Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-19/apple-watch-sales-end-at-apple-aapl-not-walmart-wmt-best-buy-bby\">Apple employees were told</a> they can’t \ninform customers that the Apple Watch remains on sale at \nthird-party retailers, such as Best Buy and Target, due to the \nlegal order. The watch will likely continue to be available at \nthose retail outlets until the supply already in the US runs out. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Things would have been drastically different for Apple’s holiday sales if this order had gone into effect weeks ago, but still, online orders are now cut off, and post-Christmas exchanges won’t be available, like for giftees who wanted a different color. Not to mention post-Christmas sales to people shopping with cash and gift certificates.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/22/apple-watch-currently-unavailable\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"93af4c1e78d193821c144e759d438ffad5fec41aeb2f05a760fc6aea2b2deeb1","category":"Tech"}
