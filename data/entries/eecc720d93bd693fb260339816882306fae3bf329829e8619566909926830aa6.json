{"title":"iPhone 13 Models Support Dual eSIMs [Updated]","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/iphone-13-models-support-dual-esims/","date":1631654403000,"content":"According to the technical specifications for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>, ‌iPhone 13‌ mini, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a>, and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max, all of the devices include dual eSIM support, which is a feature that's new to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> lineup this year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iphone-12-and-12-mini.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nDual eSIM support means that the ‌iPhone 13‌ models can use two eSIMs simultaneously rather than just one eSIM and one nano-SIM.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPrior ‌iPhone‌ models like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> had dual-SIM support, but only worked with an eSIM and a physical nano-SIM. The ‌iPhone 13‌ models still support eSIM and nano-SIM, but also support two eSIMs for adopting carrier plans without a physical SIM card.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's ‌iPhone 13‌ models will not ship with a physical SIM card this year and carriers will instead use eSIM capabilities for activation. Because eSIM activation is being used for devices connected to a carrier when ordering, a WiFi connection will be needed for setup. From Apple:\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Carrier-connected iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro models will arrive ready to activate with eSIM and can connect to your cellular voice and data service without a physical SIM card. You will need a Wi-Fi connection for setup.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo activate eSIM on an unconnected iPhone, please contact the carrier of your choice when you're ready.</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\nConnecting with a carrier later can be done by inserting a physical SIM or contacting a carrier for eSIM activation.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌iPhone 13‌ models will be available for pre-order on Friday, September 17, and will officially launch on Friday, September 24.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Update:</b> Apple has <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212780\">shared a support document</a> with more details on the eSIM, including directions on setup.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/iphone-13-models-support-dual-esims/\">iPhone 13 Models Support Dual eSIMs [Updated]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-13-models-support-dual-esims-updated.2310830/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XLr9FM_-CtY:BhT6VQ3P1Bs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XLr9FM_-CtY:BhT6VQ3P1Bs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/XLr9FM_-CtY\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"eecc720d93bd693fb260339816882306fae3bf329829e8619566909926830aa6","category":"Apple"}
