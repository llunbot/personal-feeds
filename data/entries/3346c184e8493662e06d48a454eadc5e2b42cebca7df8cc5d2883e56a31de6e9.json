Tianma would be a secondary supplier, since a bigger manufacturer <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/iphone-se-4-oled-panel-supplier-boe/\">like BOE</a> is likely to take the lion's share of orders. Apple staff responsible for panel procurement reportedly visited several major OLED panel factories in China in the first half of 2023 in relation to the ‌iPhone SE‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, the fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ will feature a 6.1-inch OLED display with a design <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/27/kuo-iphone-se-4-oled-display/\">similar to the iPhone 14</a>. It is also expected to sport Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/12/iphone-se-5g-modem-2025-launch-rumor/\">long-rumored custom 5G modem</a>.
