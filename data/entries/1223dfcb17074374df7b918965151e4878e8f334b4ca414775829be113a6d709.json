{"title":"Bontrager Charges Into Big Terrain with New Brevard & Galbraith Enduro MTB Tires","link":"https://bikerumor.com/bontrager-brevard-galbraith-enduro-mtb-tires/","date":1731013443000,"content":"<p><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bontrager-Brevard-Galbraith-enduro-MTB-tire-8-1536x1024.webp\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" alt=\"Bontrager Brevard Galbraith enduro MTB tire\" /></p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Bontrager launched four all-new MTB treads. Those tires started with the super-fast Vallnord, ranging up to the all-around trail tire called the Gunnison. Now Bontrager is completing their new MTB tire lineup with the most aggressive options in the lineup – the Brevard and Galbraith. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like those launched in April, the Brevard and Galbraith ditch the ‘XR/SE’ naming convention of the outgoing tires. Instead, the tires take naming inspiration from legendary MTB zones where the tire would be appropriate. For enduro and aggressive trail, the Brevard replaces the XR5/SE5 while the Galbraith replaces the SE6. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new naming structure also includes some changes to the levels and constructions. While the old tires went from Comp, to Expert, to Team issue for Entry/Good/Best, the new level goes Comp, Elite, Pro, and RSL for the top end. Constructions are noted as XR for XC/Trail, XT for Trail, SE for Enduro, and G for Downhill. That gives you three parts of the name, as in Brevard RSL SE which would be the top-level Brevard tire in an SE casing. Four parts if you add the TLR Tubeless Ready acronym. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bontrager-Brevard-Galbraith-enduro-MTB-tire-2-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bontrager-Brevard-Galbraith-enduro-MTB-tire-2-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Bontrager Brevard Galbraith enduro MTB tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bontrager-Brevard-Galbraith-enduro-MTB-tire-2-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bontrager-Brevard-Galbraith-enduro-MTB-tire-2-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bontrager-Brevard-Galbraith-enduro-MTB-tire-2-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bontrager-Brevard-Galbraith-enduro-MTB-tire-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bontrager-Brevard-Galbraith-enduro-MTB-tire-2-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bontrager-Brevard-Galbraith-enduro-MTB-tire-2-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bontrager-Brevard-Galbraith-enduro-MTB-tire-2-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Named after Brevard, North Carolina, the Brevard is optimized for loose and mixed terrain.

The Dual-Compound uses a medium shoulder for cornering grip and a firmer center for faster rolling and better longevity. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bontrager-Tire.png\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"863\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bontrager-Tire-1536x863.png\" alt=\"Bontrager tire lineup 2025 MTB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bontrager-Tire-1536x863.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bontrager-Tire-297x167.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bontrager-Tire-120x67.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bontrager-Tire-768x432.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bontrager-Tire-2048x1151.png 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bontrager-Tire-1200x675.png 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both tires are also offered in Bontrager’s new RSL SE construction which uses a 60TPI casing with sidewall, bead-to-bead, and apex puncture protection.

Out of the box, the Bontrager tires are pretty stiff and were a bit of a challenge to mount to the rim. An application of Schwalbe Easy Fit Tire Mounting Fluid seemed to help. Still, I had to use a tool at points, but once they were on the beads easily popped into place. I mounted the Galbraith to the front and the Brevard to the rear in hopes that the Galbraith would help hook up on the sketchy loose-over-hard fall conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting at my usual 21psi rear, 19psi front, it was immediately apparent that these tires are <em>stout</em>. I could definitely feel the weight difference from the 19 x 2.4″ Maxxis Dissectors that came off the bike, but the trade-off was a nicely damped ride feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SE casing is supportive enough that I started lowering the air pressure, eventually setting at 16/17psi front/rear. Even at those pressures on a light weight ebike, it didn’t feel overly squirmy and offered excellent traction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of my rides so far have been in the same conditions – tons of leaves, acorns, walnuts, and sticks over rock-hard dirt. This time of year you can’t even see the trail in most spots, so you really have to trust your tires. So far, the Bontragers have worked out pretty well as long as you’re OK with some controlled sliding. Understandably, with so much loose debris on top of the trails, the tires haven’t been locked into place, but the sliding is predictable and there is still plenty of grip while climbing and braking. The tires also improved quickly with some miles, but it’s still early. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pricing &amp; Availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Available now, the Brevard and Galbraith RSL SE TLR both sell for $69.99. The Brevard is also offered in Black/Tan. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bontrager-brevard-galbraith-enduro-mtb-tires/\">Bontrager Charges Into Big Terrain with New Brevard &amp; Galbraith Enduro MTB Tires</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1223dfcb17074374df7b918965151e4878e8f334b4ca414775829be113a6d709","category":"Cycling"}
