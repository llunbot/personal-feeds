First, the iPhone 17 Air would become the thinnest iPhone ever, coming in under the current 6.9mm record held by the iPhone 6. Second, the iPhone 17 Air would be around three quarters as thick as any of the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile some customers may have hoped that the iPhone 17 Air would be even thinner, there is obviously a limit to how thin the battery and other components can be. If the device comes in around 6mm, it would still be impressively thin and light compared to the increasingly bulkier models released over the past few years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is how the iPhone 17 Air's thickness could compare to other models:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li>iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max: 8.25mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 16 and 16 Plus: 7.8mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max: 8.25mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 15 and 15 Plus: 7.8mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max: 7.85mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 14 and 14 Plus: 7.8mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max: 7.65mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 13 and 13 mini: 7.65mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max: 7.4mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 12 and 12 mini: 7.4mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max: 8.1mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 11: 8.3mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone XS and XS Max: 7.7mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone XR: 8.3mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone X: 7.7mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 8 Plus: 7.5mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 8: 7.3mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 7 Plus: 7.3mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 7: 7.1mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 6s Plus: 7.3mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 6s: 7.1mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 6 Plus: 7.1mm</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 6: 6.9mm</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>iPhone 17 Air rumor: 6mm</strong></li></ul>All models prior to the iPhone 6 were between 7.6mm and 12.3mm thick.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the iPhone 17 Air could be the thinnest iPhone ever, it would not be the thinnest Apple product ever. That record is held by the 2024 version of the 13-inch iPad Pro, which is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/ipod-nano-appears-in-new-ipad-pro-ad/\">just 5.1mm thick</a>. In addition, the last iPod nano was 5.4mm thick.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor those who have not been following <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/iphone-17-slim-everything-we-know/\">iPhone 17 Air rumors</a>, several credible sources have claimed that Apple plans to release a redesigned, significantly thinner iPhone 17 model next year. The device's name is not yet known, so we are referring to it as the iPhone 17 Air for now. Pu has gone with the nickname \"iPhone 17 Slim\" instead.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere have been conflicting rumors about the design and specifications for the device, but most sources have agreed that it will have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/\">around a 6.6-inch display</a>. In July, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/\">said</a> he expects the device to have a standard A19 chip, a Dynamic Island, a single rear camera, and an Apple-designed 5G modem.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast month, Pu <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/\">agreed</a> the iPhone 17 Air will have a 6.6-inch display. He also expects the device to feature an aluminum frame, Face ID, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, a 24-megapixel front camera, and 8GB of RAM for Apple Intelligence.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will likely unveil the iPhone 17 Air in September 2025, so the device is still far away from launching, and rumors could change over time.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/iphone-17-air-could-be-thinnest-iphone-ever/\">'iPhone 17 Air' Rumored to Surpass iPhone 6 as Thinnest iPhone Ever</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-air-rumored-to-surpass-iphone-6-as-thinnest-iphone-ever.2443363/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d41059ae73c763101781c30cb53ae1891615603f98f0f5085fb4457ea9c911c2","category":"Apple"}
