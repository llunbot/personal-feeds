Personally, I see loads of value in connecting with others at such gatherings. Over the past ten years as a professional photographer in the bike industry, documenting events has gradually evolved into my natural niche. From mountain bike skills camps to supported bikepacking adventures to kids’ cross country races, I’ve wandered my curious little soul around tons of bike events capturing the essence of these spaces. In August of 2024, I had the privilege of doing just that at a super dreamy venue on traditional land of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, Confederated Tribes of Siletz, Tenino, Cayuse, Umatilla, and Walla Walla peoples in Tygh Valley, Oregon. Joyride was my first experience of an event put on by Cycle Oregon, a long-standing organization that first hosted one of the most well-known multi-day road cycling rallies in the United States back in 1988. The folks at Cycle Oregon threw one heck of a bike party at Justesen Ranch, a gorgeous spot nestled in the White River Canyon. They showed great care in creating an atmosphere that allowed riders to relax, enjoy daily supported cycling mixed-terrain routes of varied distance, participate in gravel skill clinics, yoga sessions, dance parties, and nightly entertainment, all while feeling at ease to be themselves. The catered meals were nutritious and delicious, the aid stations and lunch stops on the cycling routes hit the spot, and the scenery was downright spectacular.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-8.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Stacked with plenty of off-the-bike activities, this was a getaway for both folks who like to fill the whole day with excitement and those who prefer more time to chill and read by the river. Seasoned gravel junkies, die-hard pavement lovers, and complete novices, all found something to love at Joyride. The weekend’s lodging accommodation was good, old fashioned tent camping under the stars.</p>\n<p>The organizers offered a choice to upgrade to the popular Tent and Porter option, allowing guests to arrive to a pre-set-up tent, front door luggage service and two camp chairs for those relaxed moments between all the fun. Dry RV parking was available, too, if that’s your style. One of my favorite parts of the 2024 event was chatting with a participant who was sitting in her camp chair outside her tent with a book on Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p>I was moseying around with my cameras, as I do, and she shot me a smile. I asked how her day was going, and she was delighted to tell me it was perfect, much to her surprise. She had signed up for the event in the winter and was hit by a car on her bike shortly after. Not only was she still recovering from the injury, she was also feeling apprehensive about riding on roads and almost bailed on coming to the event altogether. Her partner convinced her to attend, and so here she was.</p>\n<p>She felt so happy that she could be here at this cycling event, among other women who love to ride and not feel any judgement or guilt for not getting on her bike. She was enjoying a good read, some dips in the river, yoga, dancing, meeting new friends, and eating scrumptious food. How good is that? There are lots of places in the world and in the bike scene where people feel intimidated or like they must fit a certain mold to be included – whether that’s objectively “true” or just how we feel doesn’t matter, it’s how people feel sometimes.</p>\n<p>To witness an event that welcomed its participants regardless of how they spent their time was refreshing and it laid the foundation for a fun-filled shindig. I caught up with a few attendees and Cycle Oregon staff members to get some perspective on what made the 2024 Joyride weekend so sweet and to learn more about Cycle Oregon’s mission, beyond hosting events.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-29.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-29.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-29.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-29.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-30.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-30.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-30.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-30.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Ashley Lance, Cycle Oregon’s Event Director, shared about her involvement in Joyride, “2024 was my first year at Cycle Oregon as Event Director and Joyride was the event I was most excited to host. Rebecca, our Customer Service and Volunteer Manager, and I worked closely to turn what was a one-day event into a full, multi-sport weekend experience. With the support of our team, sponsors, and volunteers, we worked on creating spaces, clinics, and an overall vibe that we felt was missing in the Cycle Oregon lineup.”</p>\n<p>An avid bikepacker, backpacker, and mother of a little adventurous human (plus three cats), Lance lives in Portland, OR, and has a history of organizing bike events like “Alleycross” – a hybrid alleycat/cyclocross charity race series she and her husband put on. I asked her what made Joyride special for her. She answered, “There was a feeling of coming together and supporting each other, just a general sense of ease in the community that was there.</p>\n<p>It is so rare that women and non-binary people get a space that is entirely for them, to come as you are and not worry about what others think.” Ashley recommends for those thinking of joining in on the fun in 2025 to bring some essential items like a floaty for the river, extra sparkly clothes for the dance party, your favorite bike and people, a good book, and a sense of adventure. She says they’ll handle the rest.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-20.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-20.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The organization’s flagship event, the Cycle Oregon Classic, was a week-long supported ride across the state that quickly gained recognition as “The Best Ride in America” and has evolved over 35 years into what is now the Cycle Oregon Rally. The Classic laid the groundwork for the non-profit foundation that Cycle Oregon is today.</p>\n<p>Since 1996, they have given over three million dollars in grant awards to support community projects, bicycle safety, tourism, and conservation through the Cycle Oregon Fund. In 2022, they officially established the <a href=\"https://cycleoregon.com/our-work/our-impact/\" target=\"_blank\">Cycle Oregon Foundation</a>, identifying their mission to bring the joy of riding a bicycle to all of Oregon by awarding up to $150,000 in stipends annually to communities that carry out this objective. They offer programming like <a href=\"https://cycleoregon.com/jump-start/\" target=\"_blank\">JumpStart</a>, a school-based initiative that helped teach over 5,000 kids to ride a bike in 2024 alone.</p>\n<p>They fund community projects like pump tracks (if you haven’t played around on a paved pump track yet, you are missing out, y’all!) and trail development. They have plans to launch youth summer bike camps in 2025 and a bike giveaway program for lower-resourced folks in the fall. By attending Cycle Oregon’s Joyride, Gravel, and Rally events, you’re doing so much more than riding for your own enjoyment – you are helping all sorts of individuals and communities throughout Oregon access and discover the joy of riding bikes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-42.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-42.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-42.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-42.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-43.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-43.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-43.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-43.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Joyride was launched in 2016 as a cycling event, and more importantly, it offered an experience that wasn’t just a ride, but one that fostered connections for women. Steve Schulz, a Bend, Oregon-based outdoor enthusiast and the Executive Director of Cycle Oregon shared, “I feel like the 2024 Joyride really hit the mark. The sense of community and support in all the on and off-the-bike activities was intoxicating. You could feel the energy all throughout camp and on the routes.”</p>\n<p>Steve is not wrong, there was something ineffable about the vibes out there. The venue, the people, the inclusion of Indigenous culture, amazing sponsors and vendors (hello, free bike demos from Co-Motion and beer garden featuring Pelican Brewing, Pinot Vista Wine, and NA Beer from Heck Brewing!) hemmed up an unquestionably rad event. I loved the education around respecting land and water that was shared by Elke and Alysia Littleleaf, local fly fishing guides from the Warm Springs Reservation.</p>\n<p>With plenty of road and gravel riding and a wide variety of non-cycling activities, it was a well-rounded experience. Participants had the opportunity to learn fly casting from <a href=\"https://littleleafguides.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Littleleaf Guides</a>, indulge in a therapeutic massage, enjoy some yoga, and take a swim in the river on Saturday afternoon. Friday’s agenda included an option to jump on a trail run with the fabulous Kelsey Long, a Diné/Navajo endurance athlete who is from New Mexico and currently living in Oklahoma on the Choctaw Nation Reservation.</p>\n<p>Along with Rebecca Bowman, Kelsey founded <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/werunlong/\" target=\"_blank\">We Run Long</a>, a community of Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color runners that facilitates more inclusivity in the outdoors. She was invited to Joyride to lead the trail run and as a panelist for an All Bodies on Bikes podcast that was recorded live during the event. “Joyride was incredible! I had never experienced anything like it. I have never felt so free and safe to be myself.” Long said about the event, adding, “It’s so much more than bikes. Yes, you can spend the entire time playing bikes, but you meet amazing people, you’re in a beautiful place, there are other activities to try, and the staff and volunteers are truly dedicated to making sure you have the best time.”</p>\n<p>Her hot tip for future Joyriders: “Try the rafting! This is an add-on, so it’s not part of your registration, but it was worth it! You ride to the shop, and they shuttle you to and from the river then you get back on your bike to ride to camp. It was a great way to cool off and get a break from the saddle.” Kelsey’s energy and willingness to share her experience of getting into running and cycling brought a welcoming vibe that was shinier than the glitter adorning her cheeks for Saturday night’s sparkle dance party.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-45.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-45.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-45.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-45.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>A highlight of the weekend for many was hanging out and riding with Marley Blonsky. You may be familiar with <a href=\"https://www.allbodiesonbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">All Bodies on Bikes</a>, a movement to foster a size-inclusive bike community with the belief that anyone who wants to ride a bike should be able to, regardless of size or weight. Marley is an influencer/athlete living in Bentonville, Arkansas.</p>\n<p>She’s the Executive Director of All Bodies on Bikes and co-host of the associated podcast. Her cycling journey began with commuting around Seattle back in 2014, where she fell in love with the freedom and strength she found through traveling by her own power. Trips to the grocery store morphed into weekend overnighters, gravel centuries, leading inclusive community group rides and rolling around with her dogs on a cargo bike. Marley was invited to Joyride to host a live All Bodies on Bikes podcast recording and to lead a group ride on Saturday, sharing miles and smiles through gorgeous back roads of Oregon with fellow Joyriders.</p>\n<p>Blonsky said, “Joyride 2024 was one of the best experiences of my summer. It was such a welcoming, supportive, and gorgeous weekend full of new friends and beautiful miles. I rode the 36-mile distance on Saturday and the shortest distance on Sunday, both of which were perfect. On Saturday, I rode with a small group that was dedicated to not leaving anyone behind, and we had a heck of an amazing day. We regrouped at the top of all the hills, taking in the sights of Mount Hood in the distance.</p>\n<p>We even had a farm dog tag along for a few miles! I had never ridden in this part of Oregon before and was struck by the beauty. From the rolling hills to the canyon walls surrounding the rivers, everywhere I looked was pure magic.” Marley is down-to-earth and brought a certain kind of warmth to the space, making herself available for folks to sit down at the breakfast table with and welcoming participants on Saturday’s no-drop ride. “My favorite part of the weekend was relaxing in the river after a hot ride with 25 other women, laughing and sharing memories of our ride.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-37.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-37.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-37.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-37.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Adding value to Joyride, there were chances to learn gravel riding skills with Annick Chalier, a cycling coach of several disciplines and truly a treasure of a human being. You can’t be around Annick and not belly laugh. She hosted a pre-ride clinic as well as an on-route lesson, allowing riders to better understand and put to practice maneuvering a bike over the varying surface of gravel roads. Jackie Yerby, who rode her first Cycle Oregon Classic in 2010 and is currently serving on the Board of Cycle Oregon, attended Joyride for her own enjoyment as a rider.</p>\n<p>I happened to be riding near Jackie at the beginning of the optional section of gravel on Saturday’s ride. I remember asking her how her ride was going. She looked over at me and said, “I don’t like gravel; I just don’t get it yet. I’m not sure why people like it.” Coach Annick caught up with us as Jackie was telling me this. I ping-ponged along, stopping to make photos, falling behind and bouncing ahead, as I do when I’m working from my saddle. Annick took some time to work with Jackie on the road and I spun out of there to catch some other groups on the routes.</p>\n<p>Back at camp, I was in line for a cold beverage during happy hour, and bumped into Jackie, who now had a huge smile on her face. I asked how the rest of the day was. Her reply was something like “I think I can say I might not hate riding gravel!” Moments like that are why I like events. If Jackie hadn’t joined Joyride, she might not have discovered something about herself, her ability, and the power of feeling safe enough to try something new.</p>\n<p>That’s why offering events specifically for women – affinity spaces with women as ride leaders, coaches, and advocates – is paramount to the progress and lifeblood of the cycling industry. That feeling of safety simply allows people to relax enough to try something they might not have been willing to try otherwise. Those moments can change everything for someone.</p>\n<p>I asked her what was special about Joyride, and she answered, “The Cycle Oregon team did a great job of curating program offerings such as a gravel riding clinic, white water rafting, fly fishing, yoga, a podcast featuring amazing women, and a sparkle-themed dance party. It truly felt magical. I took the gravel riding clinic not realizing that I would actually end up riding the 12-mile gravel portion on Day 2. The instructor, Annick, was terrific. I don’t love gravel, but I went from terrified of gravel to feeling pretty competent on it. I’m hoping to work my way up to enjoying it.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-51.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-51.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-51.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Cycle_Oregon_Joyride_Katie_Sox-51.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Saturday evening’s festivities included a high energy dance class that eased nerves and got everyone in the mood to shake it to vinyl spun by a live DJ. A music line-up that was top notch, the community of femme and non-binary bike friends, the tasty food plus the welcoming staff and volunteers made this an event that I would absolutely encourage folks to jump into.</p>\n<p>From a work perspective, I felt well-supported, well-fed, and included beyond my expectations. I didn’t know how much the Cycle Oregon Foundation does for communities, tourism, and advocating for healthy lifestyles and access to bikes throughout Oregon. I’m even thinking about how I can help facilitate the JumpStart program in my niece and nephew’s small, rural Oregon community.</p>\n<p>Whether you dislike group rides and cycling events like Joyride, or they’re the only way you get out on a bike these days, I’m a huge proponent of the ways these things can help us enjoy our relationship to cycling and each other on a deeper level. Bike events will never cease to surprise me with unexpected friendships and the invisible gifts of gathering in community with cycling as our link to one another.</p>\n<p>There is something so significant about remembering we’re all just humans when we find our common thread through pedaling bikes together. Steve Schulz summed it up well when he said, “It doesn’t matter what you wear, what you ride, or how you ride – simply riding a bike with others builds community and connection, and we could all use more of that!”</p>\n<p>Cycle Oregon offers <a href=\"https://cycleoregon.com/blog/2025-event-scholarships/\" target=\"_blank\">Event Scholarships</a> to reduce or remove financial barriers to access their events. <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2025-CO-Scholarship-App\" target=\"_blank\">Applications</a> are open now through May 2, 2025.
