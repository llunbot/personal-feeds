We lust after them for what feels like an eternity before finally laying our hands on them. Then there are bikes like my <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/genesis-datum-10-review\" target=\"_blank\">Genesis Datum 10</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I came across it while frantically scrolling through Facebook Marketplace, desperate to find a reliable, no-frills commuter. The first ‘proper’ bike I’d ever owned was a Genesis – sadly stolen after only a few months – and I had adored it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This love was probably more to do with enjoying the perks of a modern road bike, but it had kindled a flame in my heart for the brand and I couldn’t turn down the opportunity to own one again. I had also just become a bike mechanic (my previous life before <em>Cyclist</em>), so despite the Datum seeming pretty humble at first sight – all Shimano Tiagra groupset and budget cup-and-cone bearing wheels – I couldn’t help but look at it and dream of the possibilities.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mavic-factory\">Cosmic revival: Mavic’s road to recovery after a rocky few years</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/open-upper-gravel-bike-custom-build\">What We Ride: Sam’s Open UPPER gravel bike</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike\">Best of the best gravel bikes 2023: Cyclist’s top-rated gravel and adventure bikes</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>So it begins</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Genesis Datum 10 photos\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Joseph Branston</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to go were the wheels. In an inverse approach to learning, I had been taught to build wheels before I fully understood how gears or brakes worked, and had fallen in love with the craft. My aim was to build a set that could withstand the potholed, glass-strewn streets of London without too much bother, so sturdiness was key.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-15-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Genesis Datum 10 photos\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-15-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-15-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-15-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-15-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-15-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-15-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-15-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-15-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-15-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Joseph Branston</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me set the scene: this was during the ‘Great Parts Shortage of 2020’ so finding components was tricky, but with some luck I got my hands on a Hope RS4 rear hub and a Supernova dynamo front hub. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got as high a spoke count as I could – remember, sturdy, sturdy, sturdy – and built the hubs onto Mavic’s latest Open Pro disc rims. To add a bit of flair, I decided to do half the wheels with blue nipples and half with black, a small detail but one that felt like a personal flourish.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Genesis Datum 10 photos\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Joseph Branston</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll be honest, I’m pretty scatterbrained and have lost more bike lights than I can respectably admit to, so I opted for some Supernova E3 dynamo lights, as much for the fact they stay permanently attached as for the permanently powered visibility they offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing which tyres to wrap my new wheels in was the next big question. I had only recently graduated from the ‘23mm Gatorskins on my fixed-gear steel bike’ mindset, so I was largely at sea. I now had a bike with 35mm tyre clearance, which gave me overwhelming possibilities, so I eventually plumped for some tubeless Schwalbe Marathon Supremes in 32mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-7-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Genesis Datum 10 photos\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-7-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-7-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-7-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-7-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-7-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-7-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-7-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-7-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-7-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Joseph Branston</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I rode those tyres for two hours a day, every day, for over a year without getting a puncture until one darn shard of glass sliced a hole in the sidewall. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To this day they are my favourite commuting tyres, but sadly they’ve been discontinued, so instead I popped on the next-closest thing, a set of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-winter-road-bike-tyres-stay-puncture-free\" target=\"_blank\">Continental Grand Prix 4 Seasons</a> that a customer at the workshop no longer wanted.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Path to happiness</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Genesis stood for some time. The immediate work was done, the new wheels gleamed, and all was well. But there one slight bugbear: the levers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it was pretty cool that I had some hydraulic Tiagra shifters – given that they’re not that common – they were overly chunky and my hands are small. In true bike shop style I couldn’t afford to replace them with anything new, but in the end patience proved my friend.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-4-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Genesis Datum 10 photos\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-4-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlotte-genesis_det-4-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Joseph Branston</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A customer had fallen off their bike (they were fine, thankfully) so they wanted their 105 shifters replaced, and told us we could keep the old ones. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What was wrong with them? The rubber hoods were scuffed, along with some of the plastic body. That was it. They were short reach, in almost mint condition, and I dibs-ed them so quickly that no one even saw me coming.
