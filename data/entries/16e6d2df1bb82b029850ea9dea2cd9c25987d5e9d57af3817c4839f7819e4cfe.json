You will need to wear both earbuds during a workout to get this functionality. You will also be able to connect the earbuds to gym equipment to measure heart rate while using a machine like a treadmill. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt sounds like heart rate will only be measured when a workout is started in a compatible fitness app, but this is not functionality offered in any other earbuds that Apple or Beats makes. The earbuds are also set to support Active Noise Cancellation, Spatial Audio, and Adaptive Audio.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBased on images found in the software, the ‌Powerbeats Pro‌ 2 will come in orange, purple, black, and a beige color, and they will have matching colored charging cases. While the new earbuds look similar to the current ‌Powerbeats Pro‌, the updated version has a slimmer design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's Beats brand has not yet provided a specific release date for the new wireless headphones, but they are set to launch in 2025. <br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/powerbeats-pro-2-heart-rate/\">Apple's New Powerbeats Pro 2 Will Measure Heart Rate From Your Ears</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-new-powerbeats-pro-2-will-measure-heart-rate-from-your-ears.2435528/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"16e6d2df1bb82b029850ea9dea2cd9c25987d5e9d57af3817c4839f7819e4cfe","category":"Apple"}
