This means the company can now proceed to build and order components for the \"Blue Ghost\" spacecraft and begin its assembly. Firefly aims to launch the spacecraft as the primary payload on a Falcon 9 rocket in the fall of 2023.</p>\n<p>NASA is sponsoring the mission as part of itsÂ Commercial Lunar Payload Services Program, through which it pays private companies to deliver scientific experiments to the Moon. NASA is paying $93.3 million for this Blue Ghost mission, which will carry 10 payloads down to the Mare Crisium lunar basin in September 2023.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1807097#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1807097&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"db4cb6d51d1bdabb4581a644599b17be0ed10d9c30b0545a8037f3ff6b6cc026","category":"Tech"}
