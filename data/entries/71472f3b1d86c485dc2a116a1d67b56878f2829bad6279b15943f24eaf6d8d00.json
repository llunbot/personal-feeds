While we've known for some time that the iPhone 16 Pro will measure in at 6.3 inches (up from 6.1) and the Pro Max will measure in at 6.9 inches (up from 6.7), we have not had a complete picture of every dimension, until now. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iphone-16-pro-max-ice-universe.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /><div><em>iPhone 16 Pro Max (Image credit: <a href=\"https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1798245080844914918\">UniverseIce</a>)</em></div>\r<br />\nDespite being bigger phones, one dimension in particular that is reduced on the iPhone 16 Pro models is the screen border. Chinese Weibo-based leakers <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5673255066/OhAmQgJx7\">UniverseIce</a> and <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5143897135/Ohu05eHXs\">Instant Digital</a> have now corroborated rumored bezel sizes for both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, providing a comprehensive picture of the dimensions of Apple's next-generation devices ahead of the iPhone 16 series' launch around mid-September. Here they are compared to Apple's iPhone 15 Pro models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>iPhone 16 Pro</h3>\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th></th>\r<br />\n <th>iPhone 16 Pro</th>\r<br />\n <th>iPhone 15 Pro</th>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>Thickness</th>\r<br />\n <td>8.25 mm</td>\r<br />\n <td>8.25 mm</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>Height</th>\r<br />\n <td>149.6 mm</td>\r<br />\n <td>146.6 mm</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>Width</th>\r<br />\n <td>71.45 mm</td>\r<br />\n <td>70.60 mm</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>Display</th>\r<br />\n <td>6.3\" (159.31 mm)</td>\r<br />\n <td>6.1\" (155.38 mm)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n<tr>\r<br />\n<th>Screen Border</th>\r<br />\n<td>1.2 mm</td>\r<br />\n<td>1.71 mm</td>\r<br />\n</tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>Weight</th>\r<br />\n <td>194 grams</td>\r<br />\n <td>187 grams</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n </table>\r<br />\n<div></div><p></p>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>iPhone 16 Pro Max</h3>\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th></th>\r<br />\n <th>iPhone 16 Pro Max</th>\r<br />\n <th>iPhone 15 Pro Max</th>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>Thickness</th>\r<br />\n <td>8.26 mm</td>\r<br />\n <td>8.25 mm</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>Height</th>\r<br />\n <td>163.0 mm</td>\r<br />\n <td>159.9 mm</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>Width</th>\r<br />\n <td>77.58 mm</td>\r<br />\n <td>76.70 mm</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>Display</th>\r<br />\n <td>6.9\" (174.06 mm)</td>\r<br />\n <td>6.7\" (169.98 mm)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n<th>Screen Border</th>\r<br />\n<td>1.15 mm</td>\r<br />\n<td>1.55 mm</td>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>Weight</th>\r<br />\n <td>225 grams</td>\r<br />\n <td>221 grams</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n </table>\r<br />\n<div></div><p></p>\r<br />\nLast year, Apple reduced the screen border on iPhone 15 Pro models using low-injection pressure over-molding, or LIPO. This year, Apple is said to be using Border Reduction Structure (BRS) technology, which allows for a more compact and efficient layout of the circuitry under the display, resulting in even slimmer bezels.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs the tables show, the screen border on the iPhone 16 Pro is 1.2 mm (down from 1.71 mm), which is a 30% reduction. Meanwhile, the border on the larger iPhone 16 Pro Max is 1.15 mm (down from 1.55 mm), which is a 26% reduction. For a rival phone comparison, the border on the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is 1.5 mm.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe reductions are expected to give Apple's premium smartphones the \"<a href=\"https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5040859970798441\">narrowest screen frame in the world.</a>\" But to get a better idea of the difference between last year's iPhone 15 Pro Max and the forthcoming iPhone 16 Pro Max, UniverseIce shared the following picture. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iphone-15-16-pro-max-universeice.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /><div><em>iPhone 16 Pro Max (left) vs. iPhone 15 Pro Max (Image credit: <a href=\"https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1797887190510522437\">UniverseIce</a>)</em></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo users coming from an iPhone 15 Pro model, the screen border difference is likely to look slight, but it's worth remembering that the displays themselves are bigger on the iPhone 16 Pro models, and a narrower screen border will reduce how much bigger the chassis needs to be, so the effect is likely to be more significant when actually holding the phone and looking at the the screen in real life.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor those planning to upgrade from an older iPhone \"Pro\" model though, the screen differences are pretty obvious â€“ UniverseIce provided the following comparison of the iPhone 16 Pro Max alongside the iPhone 13 Pro Max, released in 2021.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iphone-13-16-pro-max-bezels-ice-universe1.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /><div><em>iPhone 16 Pro Max (left) vs. iPhone 13 Pro Max (Image credit: <a href=\"https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1797887190510522437\">UniverseIce</a>)</em></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf slimmer bezels don't seem that big a deal on their own, the new iPhones also have upgraded camera technology, a new Capture button, new modem chips, new color options, and more.
