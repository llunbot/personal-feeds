Priced at $79.99 and shipping in June, Beats Solo Buds deliver 18 hours of battery life and come in the smallest case ever designed for Beats earbuds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/beats-solo-buds-purple.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nBeats Solo Buds feature a custom-built acoustic architecture and an ergonomic design with four ear tip size options for a precise fit. There is no active noise cancelation on the Beats Solo Buds, but they do offer passive noise isolation to improve audio quality. A custom microphone design paired with an advanced noise-learning algorithm help deliver improved call quality.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nWhen it comes to battery life, Beats Solo Buds offer up to 18 hours of playback right in the buds themselves without needing to recharge, which is easily the longest battery life for any Beats earbud product.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBut when their batteries do run out, you'll need to find a power source, as the charging case does not include any additional battery storage onboard for recharging directly from the case. That not only helps keep costs down, but also allows for the tiny case that slips easily into a pocket and is 40% smaller than the case for Beats Studio Buds +.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/beats-solo-buds-black-pocket.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nWith up to 18 hours of battery life in the buds, most users will be able to go multiple days without needing to recharge Beats Solo Buds at all. When that time comes, however, all they have to do is to connect a power source to the USB-C port on the case, and that power source can even be an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>. A Fast Fuel feature provides an hour of playback time with just five minutes of charging.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/beats-solo-buds-gray-charging.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nAs with most other recent Beats headphones and earphones, Solo Buds include a custom Beats chip platform that allows for tight integration across both iOS and Android with one-touch pairing, automatic setup across devices, and support for Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a> and Android's ‌Find My‌ Device services. The Beats 'b\" buttons on the buds can be configured for a variety of functions, including music and phone call controls, voice assistant activation, and volume control.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/beats-solo-buds-red-pairing.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nBeats Solo Buds will begin shipping in June and will be available in four colors: Matte Black, Storm Gray, Arctic Purple, and Transparent Red. With the introduction of Solo Buds, Beats will be discontinuing the standard Beats Studio Buds but will be retaining the more advanced Beats Studio Buds +. The Beats earbud lineup will also continue to include the Beats Fit Pro and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/\">Powerbeats Pro</a>, so there will be a full range of truly wireless earphone options to suit all types of users.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/\">Beats</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-buds-announced/\">Beats Solo Buds Launching in June With 18-Hour Battery Life and a Tiny Case for $79.99</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beats-solo-buds-launching-in-june-with-18-hour-battery-life-and-a-tiny-case-for-79-99.2425192/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3021b52c2ce511a34bb8a0bcc34b172bb02a128d45cd832bca1520a6c33464eb","category":"Apple"}
