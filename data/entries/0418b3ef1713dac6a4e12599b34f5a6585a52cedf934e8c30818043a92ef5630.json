The leaker has a private account, so we are not identifying it or linking to it, but they have proven to be a consistently accurate source for upcoming iOS updates.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/General-iOS-17-Feature-Orange-Purple.jpg\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\n<em>MacRumors</em> can independently confirm that Apple is internally testing an iOS 17.6.1 update, which is present in our analytics logs. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nNothing is known about iOS 17.6.1, beyond the leaker claiming that the update will have a build number of 21G93. However, the update will almost certainly be a minor one, especially given that Apple is focused on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/ios-18-beta-5-features/\">iOS 18</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/apple-releases-ios-18-1-apple-intelligence/\">iOS 18.1 beta testing</a>. iPhone users still running iOS 17 can expect the update to include bug fixes and/or security patches.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is unclear when iOS 17.6.1 will be released to the public, but updates revealed by this leaker typically become available within a few weeks after they post on social media. The update will likely be released in the first half of August.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/06/apple-preparing-ios-17-6-1/\">Apple Preparing iOS 17.6.1 Update Alongside iOS 18 and iOS 18.1 Betas</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-ios-17-6-1-update-alongside-ios-18-and-ios-18-1-betas.2433054/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0418b3ef1713dac6a4e12599b34f5a6585a52cedf934e8c30818043a92ef5630","category":"Apple"}
