Last year, for example, SpaceX launched 134 orbital missions. Combined, Europe had three. SpaceX operates a massive constellation of more than 7,000 satellites, delivering broadband Internet around the world. Europe hopes to have <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/finally-a-sign-of-life-for-europes-sovereign-satellite-internet-constellation/\">a much more modest capability online</a> by 2030 serving the continent at a cost of $11 billion.</p>\n<p>And Europe has good reasons for being wary about working directly with SpaceX. First, Europe wants to maintain sovereign access to space, as well as a space-based communication network. Second, buying services from SpaceX undermines European space businesses. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Musk has recently begun attacking governments in European capitals such as Berlin and London, taking up the \"Make Europe Great Again\" slogan. This seems to entail throwing out the moderate coalitions governing European nations and replacing them with authoritarian, hard-right leaders.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/europe-has-the-worst-imaginable-idea-to-counter-spacexs-launch-dominance/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/europe-has-the-worst-imaginable-idea-to-counter-spacexs-launch-dominance/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b0d9bb916575378375af1f116ea567272c354e534bc479f2480e9a19991f393a","category":"Tech"}
