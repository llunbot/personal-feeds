Apple is presumably conducting this biomechanics research and development in relation to the Apple Watch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Apple Watch already contains an actuator, temperature sensor, and photodiodes, but it does not have a strain gauge. Strain gauges measure variations in electrical resistance when force is applied. They are already widely used in motion-tracking and physiological monitoring systems. Researchers have <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/inf2.12122\">demonstrated</a> how a single, non-invasive strain sensor placed on the wrist can accurately measure the full range of strains on human skin, as well as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/03/apple-watch-blood-pressure-glucose-alcohol/\">monitor blood pressure</a> â€“ another health feature rumored for <a href=\"http://rumored\">future Apple Watch models</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Apple Watch can only track active calories, time, and heart rate during strength training workouts. These metrics are more useful for tracking aerobic activities like running or cycling, but are less insightful in the context of strength training because heart rate is not proportional to effort and load. Strain gauges, on the other hand, can help track the specific impact of various strength training exercises. In addition, the Workout app does not offer any ability to capture weights, reps, and sets to calculate muscular loads, so there is much Apple could do to improve strength training tracking with the Apple Watch.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 8</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/health-and-fitness/\">Health and Fitness</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/health-technologies/\">Health Technologies</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/14/apple-researching-strain-sensors/\">Apple Likely Researching Strain Sensors to Improve Apple Watch Strength Workout Tracking</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-likely-researching-strain-sensors-to-improve-apple-watch-strength-workout-tracking.2398619/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9cc2123f556e61e80fe82636c98f2b84302f6fcb3ecf219e401d8da518d16102","category":"Apple"}
