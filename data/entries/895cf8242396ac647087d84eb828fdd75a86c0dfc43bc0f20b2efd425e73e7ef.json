{"title":"Apple Has Resumed Advertising on X for the First Time Since Late 2023","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/12/apple-resumes-advertising-on-x/","date":1739415901000,"content":"\n<p>Joe Rossignol, MacRumors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple this month started advertising on X for the first time in\nmore than a year. The company <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/apple-pauses-ads-on-x/\">had stopped advertising</a> on\nthe social media platform in November 2023 following controversial\nremarks made by its owner Elon Musk.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the @Apple account is <a href=\"https://x.com/apple/status/1889089503278813659\">running an ad</a> promoting\nSafari’s privacy features. The ad was spotted by MacRumors\ncontributor <a href=\"https://x.com/aaronp613\">Aaron Perris</a>. The @AppleTV account has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdtechBrags/status/1888708923651440701\">also\nbeen running ads</a> for the Apple TV+ show Severance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The November 2023 outrage was in response to, among other things, <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1724908287471272299\">Musk replying</a> “You have said the actual truth” to <a href=\"https://x.com/breakingbaht/status/1724892505647296620\">a tweet</a> that stated “I’m deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest shit now about western Jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country don’t exactly like them too much. You want truth said to your face, there it is.”</p>\n\n<p>Musk clearly learned his lesson. Since then, he’s been lying low, out of the public eye, and refraining from any sort of controversial statements or actions. He barely even tweets anymore. The one and only time I can recall him even being in the news in the last 18 months was <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/elon-musk-illegal-drugs-e826a9e1\">this year-ago profile in the Wall Street Journal</a> documenting Musk’s health and nutrition regimen. So it’s all cool now and Apple feels comfortable advertising on the social network Musk wholly owns.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/12/apple-advertising-x\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"895cf8242396ac647087d84eb828fdd75a86c0dfc43bc0f20b2efd425e73e7ef","category":"Tech"}
