We call it Apple Breakfast because we think it goes great with a Monday morning cup of coffee or tea, but it’s cool if you want to give it a read during lunch or dinner hours too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to make enemies and alienate people</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s annoying, isn’t it, when you spend years kicking someone repeatedly in the face, and then they decide they no longer want to be your friend! The audacity, honestly. Whatever happened to loyalty?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is presumably wondering the same thing right now, as it reacts to news that three of the biggest apps for iOS—YouTube, Netflix, and Spotify—will <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2212139/major-apps-wont-be-available-vision-pro.html\">not be making an appearance</a>, at least initially, on the company’s new Vision Pro mixed-reality headset. After working together with Apple in beautiful and mutually profitable harmony for a decade and more, these three ungrateful so-called partners have abandoned it at a moment of great need, and history will expose them as the snakes they are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or perhaps not. Because Apple doesn’t really do harmony. And while the makers of those three apps have doubtless seen plenty of profits as a result of their relationship with Cupertino, there’s little doubt that Apple thinks about itself first and foremost, and its partners a distant last. If it thinks about them at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, it’s difficult to escape the feeling, watching Apple over the years, that it regards the people who write third-party software for its platforms as just another kind of enemy. The App Store has historically been notable for its high fees, strict rules, and draconian rulings without a straightforward appeals process. It buys adverts on <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678103/different-think-the-shabby-greed-of-apples-app-adverts.html\">searches for partners’ brand names</a> in order to scoop up a cut of signup revenue that would otherwise go directly to the company making the thing people want to buy. It’s even been accused of courting partnerships with small devs in order to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1788560/sherlocking-valencell-apple-watch-patents-developers.html\">steal their ideas</a>, a claim made so often that it has its own name, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/223523/sherlocked-nine-technologies-apple-disrupted-at-wwdc.html\">Sherlocking</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At every point, Apple has treated developers exactly as badly as it feels it can get away with. Every concession, from lower fees and alternative payment systems to a simpler appeals process, has been won through long-running PR battles and regulatory pressure. The company may see itself as a pirate, but it behaves like a Victorian factory owner frustrated by legal limits on child maiming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of these specific apps, Apple can hardly be surprised by a lack of collegial spirit. Spotify claimed the Apple One bundled service was unfair and anti-competitive, and liable to cause <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675107/spotify-says-unfair-apple-one-will-cause-irreparable-harm.html\">“irreparable harm”</a> and “threaten our collective freedoms.” YouTube is owned by Google, literally Apple’s direct competitor for smartphones, smart speakers, web browsers, and app stores. And Netflix is fighting for its life against Apple TV+ just as much as Spotify is fending off Apple Music. None of these are companies that are motivated to see Apple do well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it’s not just those three. According to Appfigures (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/22/only-150-apps-have-been-designed-specifically-for-apples-vision-pro-so-far/&amp;xcust=1-1-2201774-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">via TechCrunch</a>), just 150 of the nearly 2 billion App Store apps have been updated for visionOS. That’s not just a drop in the bucket—it’s barely a mist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that context, it’s only reasonable that iOS and macOS app makers would evaluate the new visionOS platform with the cool and selfish detachment of an investor on Dragon’s Den. “What’s in it for me?” is the only logical question for them to ask themselves, and in this case it would appear the answer is “Not much.” Vision Pro may yet become the biggest computing platform on the planet, but not for a while, and maybe not at all. In the first generation, it will be a novelty. Google won’t be missing out on much by telling Vision Pro owners to view YouTube through the browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps these fellow tech giants were always going to feel ambivalent about backing an Apple venture that can only threaten them in the long run. But what of the smaller companies? The iPhone became an all-consuming success it is only because bedroom app developers got on board with such enthusiasm and innovation; will the Vision Pro repeat the trick? It’s too early to tell. But after all the pushy behavior over the years, you wouldn’t blame devs for wondering if Apple really has their backs, and whether building an app for visionOS is a fast route to getting kicked in the face.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3811721/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trending: Top stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We round up <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2198366/apple-vision-pro-order-spatial-video-home-theater-persona-mac.html\">5 reasons</a> why you should <strong>buy the Vision Pro</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vision Pro is already making its <strong>AI competition look silly</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2202281/vision-pro-humane-ai-pin-price-specs-functionality.html\">reckons the Macalope</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samsung’s <strong>Galaxy S24 Ultra</strong> is like a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2204859/samsungs-galaxy-s24-ultra-bizarro-iphone-15-pro-max-titanium-price-zoom-qi2.html\">bizarro iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An <strong>OLED iPad Pro</strong> will be worth every extra penny–if it delivers <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2203369/ipad-pro-too-expensive.html\">this one feature</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2203253/apple-sold-more-phones-than-any-other-company-last-year-for-the-first-time-ever.html\">sold more phones</a> than any other company last year–for the <strong>first time ever</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Podcast of the week</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On this episode of the Macworld Podcast, it’s all about your hot takes!
