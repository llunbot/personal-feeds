Its architecture is based on machine learning techniques including large language models (LLMs). \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhereas ChatGPT is foremost designed for versatility and scalability, Anthropic says its focus is on creating a \"steerable\" AI so that users can direct the model's style and content more effectively, thereby mitigating potential harmful outputs and biases from the outset.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe AI company says its Claude iOS app features:\r<br />\n<blockquote><ul><li>Seamless syncing with web chats: Pick up where you left off across devices.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Vision capabilities: Use photos from your library, take new photos, or upload files so you can have real-time image analysis, contextual understanding, and mobile-centric use cases on the go.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Open access: Users across all plans, including Pro and Team, can download the app free of charge.</li></ul></blockquote>According to Anthropic, early testers report that the Claude app is exceptional for brainstorming ideas on the go, getting quick answers to questions, or analyzing scenes and images from the real world. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn March, Anthropic <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family\">announced</a> that its Claude 3 language model surpassed ChatGPT and Google's Gemini in various critical industry benchmarks. According to the company, Claude 3 excelled in areas including graduate-level reasoning and multilingual math and coding, among other metrics. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnthropic also highlighted that their most advanced version of Claude 3, named Opus, demonstrated capabilities close to human level, particularly in delivering quick responses, making it well-suited for complex and urgent tasks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nClaude for ‌iPhone‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> is a free download available from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>.
