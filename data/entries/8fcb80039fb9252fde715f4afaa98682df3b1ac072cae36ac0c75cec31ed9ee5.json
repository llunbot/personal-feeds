The new HomePod features a similar design as the original smart speaker, with a larger backlit touch surface and a few other improvements. Despite having two fewer tweeters, reviews found the new HomePod <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/review/homepod/\">sounds virtually the same</a> as the original, but Siri still has shortcomings compared to other virtual assistants.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe smaller HomePod mini was introduced in October 2020 and has not received any hardware changes since beyond new color options. The launch of the HomePod mini in Singapore next month likely rules out a second-generation model launching in the near future.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini\">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/27/homepod-launching-in-singapore-next-month/\">HomePod and HomePod Mini Launching in Singapore Next Month</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/homepod-and-homepod-mini-launching-in-singapore-next-month.2385019/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8fcb80039fb9252fde715f4afaa98682df3b1ac072cae36ac0c75cec31ed9ee5","category":"Apple"}
