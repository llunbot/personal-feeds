While only being available in one size, the lower-sloped top tube makes it accessible to riders of almost any body proportion, fitting riders from 160 cm or about 5′ 2″ to 190 cm, or about 6′ 2″, and still being a great ride.</p>\n<p>Roll on over to <a href=\"https://omniumcargo.com/nano/\" target=\"_blank\">Omnium</a> to read all about the new Nano, its optional upgrades, and availability.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/omnium-mini-velo-nano\">Omnium Mini Velo Nano is For Jibbin’ and Haulin’</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cms.theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"de78a568f8b36776762a5cdd40e48ed60302a69e1a5e0087cbd55dfd70286c7d","category":"Cycling"}
