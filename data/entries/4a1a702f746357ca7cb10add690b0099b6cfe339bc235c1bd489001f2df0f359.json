Some hook up three monitors and there are even docks that support up to four external screens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At CES, accessory maker Plugable unveiled the first docking station that can support five external monitors. Through the use of DisplayLink technology this expanse of screen real estate is available even to owners of the plain M1 and M2 MacBooks previously limited by Apple to just the solitary one external display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UD-7400PD is a hybrid docking station that uses two technologies to drive the connected displays: USB-C Alt Mode Video and DisplayLink (third-party software that the user downloads before setting up the dock). For more details, see our explainer on <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675869/how-to-connect-two-or-more-external-displays-to-apple-silicon-m1-macs.html\" target=\"_blank\">how to connect multiple external displays to a Mac using DisplayLink</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up to five high-resolution displays can be added: three 6K screens, or one 6K plus four 4K displays. For Windows PCs, the 6K screen can be upgraded to a full 8K one. This mega multi-screen support is made possible by the dock’s use of the DisplayLink DL-7400 chipset.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Plugable-UD-7400PD-Docking-Station-5-display-dock.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Plugable UD 7400PD Docking Station 5 display dock\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Plugable-UD-7400PD-Docking-Station-5-display-dock.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Plugable-UD-7400PD-Docking-Station-5-display-dock.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Plugable-UD-7400PD-Docking-Station-5-display-dock.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Plugable-UD-7400PD-Docking-Station-5-display-dock.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Plugable</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do you need five screens?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably not. Very few people actually need or desire five monitors, but the UD-7400PD dock offers flexibility. Users can choose from the five video options—one HDMI 2.1 for the highest 6K resolution, one HDMI 2.0 for 4K at 60Hz, and three 10Gbps USB-C ports with DisplayLink enabled for 4K at 60Hz—with any unused USB-C ports free for other devices with full data, video and power potential (up to 15W).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having the same and full USB-C options available for each port makes usage simple for the user, rather than having to select a particular one for video and others for power or data. The UD-7400PD dock offers PD 3.1 140W Power Delivery, meaning it can be used to fast-charge even the top-end 16-inch MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Plugable-UD-7400PD-dock-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Plugable UD 7400PD dock ports\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Plugable-UD-7400PD-dock-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Plugable-UD-7400PD-dock-ports.jpg?resize=300%2C182&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Plugable-UD-7400PD-dock-ports.jpg?resize=768%2C465&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Plugable-UD-7400PD-dock-ports.jpg?resize=1200%2C727&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Plugable-UD-7400PD-dock-ports.jpg?resize=1536%2C930&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Plugable-UD-7400PD-dock-ports.jpg?resize=2048%2C1240&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"727\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Plugable</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The top-end specs continue with a 2.5Gb Ethernet port, which will dramatically speed up a network supported at the same speed. At the front is another USB-C port capable of outputting 30W of power, enough to fast-charge any iPhone. Two legacy but speedy 10Gbps USB-A ports (7.5W) and a combo 3.5mm audio socket round out the front ports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://plugable.com/products/ud-7400pd\" target=\"_blank\">UD-7400PD dock</a> is expected to be available in March for approximately $265.
