While such activity is typically monitored by seismometers, seismologists at Northwestern University are also <a href=\"https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2023/11/listen-to-icelands-recent-seismic-activity/?fj=1\">listening to the data</a> collected by the region's Global Seismographic Network station using an app they developed a few years ago called <a href=\"https://sites.northwestern.edu/earthtunes/\">Earthtunes</a>.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://earthtunes.ci.northwestern.edu/wave/62a96e364e7\">the app</a>, those earthquakes can sound like <a href=\"https://earthtunes.ci.northwestern.edu/wave/55f20d6b4d5\">slamming doors</a> or hail pelting a window or roof. “The activity is formidable, exciting, and scary,” <a href=\"https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2023/11/listen-to-icelands-recent-seismic-activity/?fj=1\">said Suzan van der Lee</a>, a Northwestern seismologist who co-developed Earthtunes. “Iceland did the right thing by evacuating residents in nearby Grindavik and the nearby Svartsengi geothermal power plant.”</p>\n<p>Sonification of scientific data is an area of growing interest in many different fields. For instance, several years ago, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2012/may/23/cern-lhc-sound\" target=\"_blank\">project called LHCSound</a> built a library of the “sounds” of a top quark jet and the Higgs boson, among others. The project hoped to develop sonification as a technique for analyzing the data from particle collisions so that physicists could “detect” subatomic particles by ear. Other scientists have <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/510726/setting-silk-to-music/\">mapped the molecular structure</a> of proteins <a href=\"http://news.mit.edu/2012/the-music-of-the-silks-1128\">in spider silk</a> threads onto musical theory to produce <a href=\"http://physicsbuzz.physicscentral.com/2012/11/scientists-build-silk-and-then-listen.html\">the \"sound\" of silk</a> in hopes of establishing a radical new way to create designer proteins. And there's a free app for Android called the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.synth.aminoacidplayer\">Amino Acid Synthesizer</a> that enables users to create their own protein \"compositions\" from the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/06/amino-acids-make-beautiful-music-to-design-novel-protein-structures/\">sounds of amino acids</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984382#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984382&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"76d62985d85a2eef65d95615db0d3489498eb631fd271f6d2c43212a17248477","category":"Tech"}
