There’s no pattern they see, and, as with previous correspondents, turning the display off and on clears the issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there’s no one answer, research makes it appear as if either the cable <em>or</em> a protocol carried over the cable is the issue. You can troubleshoot this fairly easily depending on the model of Mac and display you have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The HDCP (High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection) protocol runs behind the scenes on all devices that conform to HDMI or DisplayPort specifications (including using them over Thunderbolt or USB) as a laughable attempt to prevent piracy. HDCP requires a kind of “handshake” between the host device (a Mac or other computer) and a display. If the handshake fails, which can happen if there’s a slight delay after the Mac wakes and the display doesn’t get the response it needs, you might see static. Unplugging the cable, power cycling the display, or pressing Esc at a login window screen and then pressing any key should clear the state, but only once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people have found that changing out their cable solves the problem, whether the root is HDCP or a cable issue. HDMI cables are rated for particular performance. You don’t need a specially gold-plated one that costs 20 times as much as a normal cable, but you almost certainly need an HDMI High Speed cable or better, which start at under $10.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All DisplayPort cables can handle any resolution and refresh, but because Apple only uses USB-C and HDMI ports for carrying video data, you are likely using either an HDMI-to-HDMI cable, a USB-C-to-HDMI cable, or a USB-C adapter or dock with an HDMI port in it. If your display has native USB-C support and you have a spare port, try a USB-C-to-USB-C cable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Jim.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
