Let's save lives together by encouraging donations of blood, platelets, and plasma, and signing up as bone marrow and organ donors. While most blood drives are specific to a geographic location, our blood drive is online and worldwide. Anyone can participate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/blood_drive_2025.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"672\" />\r<br />\nOver the past 15 years, MacRumors Blood Drives have recorded donations of <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/posts/33175443/\">1,565 units of blood, platelets, and plasma</a>, cheered for donors, and celebrated new signups for the bone marrow and organ donor registries.

Whether you're a regular donor like Linda+ or someone overcoming apprehension to donate for the very first time, we congratulate you.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/featured_donor_2025.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" />\r<br />\n<h3>How to participate in the MacRumors Blood Drive</h3>\r<br />\n<ol><li>If you are an eligible donor, schedule a blood, platelet, or plasma donation (<a href=\"https://macrumors.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201729417-Blood-and-Platelet-Donation-\">FAQ</a>) at any donation center near you.
