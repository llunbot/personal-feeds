In the past, we've featured year-end roundups of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/ten-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed/\">cool science stories</a> we (almost) missed. This year, we're experimenting with a monthly collection. February's list includes dancing sea turtles, the secret to a perfectly boiled egg, the latest breakthrough in deciphering the Herculaneum scrolls, the discovery of an Egyptian pharaoh's tomb, and more.</p>\n<h2>Dancing sea turtles</h2>\n<div><div></div></div>\n<p>There is growing evidence that certain migratory animal species (turtles, birds, some species of fish) are able to exploit the Earth's magnetic field for navigation, using it both as a compass to determine direction and as a kind of \"map\" to track their geographical position while migrating. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08554-y\">A paper</a> published in the journal Nature offers evidence of a possible mechanism for this unusual ability, at least in loggerhead sea turtles, who perform an energetic \"dance\" when they follow magnetic fields to a tasty snack.</p>\n<p>Sea turtles make impressive 8,000-mile migrations across oceans and tend to return to the same feeding and nesting sites. The authors believe they achieve this through their ability to remember the magnetic signature of those areas and store them in a mental map. To test that hypothesis, the scientists placed juvenile sea turtles into two large tanks of water outfitted with large coils to create magnetic signatures at specific locations within the tanks. One tank features such a location that had food; the other had a similar location without food.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/research-roundup-7-cool-science-stories-from-february/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/research-roundup-7-cool-science-stories-from-february/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c7427c75b5411e09842186b777ae03ee476fede676e85294a12ea6f890fca648","category":"Tech"}
