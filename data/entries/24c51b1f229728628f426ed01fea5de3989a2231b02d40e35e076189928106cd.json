{"title":"Automattic Acquires Beeper, Will Merge With Texts","link":"https://blog.beeper.com/2024/04/09/beeper-is-joining-automattic/","date":1712873967000,"content":"\n<p>Eric Migicovsky:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you haven’t heard of <a href=\"https://beeper.com/\">Beeper</a> before, welcome! We make a \nuniversal chat app — one app to send and receive messages on 14 \ndifferent chat networks. You might have also heard about Beeper \nMini, our briefly available iMessage-on-Android app. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While the <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/search/beeper\">Beeper Mini/iMessage thing</a> is where Beeper garnered, by far, the most publicity, it was always a sideshow from their primary goal of building a universal messaging app for multiple (14!) platforms. Think of it like a modern-day <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Adaringfireball.net%20adium\">Adium</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In many ways, our journey has only just begun. Beeper has just \nover 115,000 users and was, <a href=\"https://blog.beeper.com/2024/04/09/beeper-is-now-available/\">until today</a>, in beta. Given \nthe state of the messaging landscape today, we believe there is a \nhuge opportunity for us to push boundaries and create new \nexperiences in chat. The majority of other chat apps have \nstagnated, entrenched in their positions, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1761916874227622299\">no significant new \nplayers</a> emerging since Discord’s launch in 2015. Given \nthe state of the messaging world, we’ve long felt the need for a \nstrong ally with the resources to support us on our quest. \nAutomattic has a long history of putting user control and privacy \nfirst with open source, and great bilateral relationships with \nMeta, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Matrix and others that we hope can \nusher in a new era of collaboration. [...] </p>\n\n<p>This is a big bet. Automattic is doubling down on chat after their \nacquisition last year of <a href=\"http://texts.com/\">Texts.com</a>, a messaging app with \na similar mission. Our teams and products will merge, and I will \ntake on the role leading the team as Head of Messaging. It will \ntake a bit of time for us to integrate and combine forces under \nthe Beeper brand. We’ve got big plans! </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’d describe Texts.com as having not just a similar mission as Beeper, but the exact same mission. I’ve been using Texts on my Mac as my primary interface to Twitter/X DMs for over a year (since Twitter shut down third-party clients like Tweetbot and Twitterrific). I don’t get a ton of Twitter DMs, and I get fewer now than ever before, but Texts offers a better interface to them than Twitter/X itself does. I also have my Instagram, WhatsApp, and Signal accounts connected to Texts. If I used any of those platforms heavily, I’d rely on their dedicated apps. But I don’t, so a universal messaging inbox is better. I’m more interested in having one central place to check than anything else for those platforms.</p>\n\n<p>Now that I’ve tried Beeper for Mac (connecting Twitter/X, WhatsApp, Signal, Instagram, and Slack accounts) — it’s remarkable how similar it is to Texts. They’re both Electron/React apps, and both suffer from a lot of Electron-isms. (What in the world is going on with the keyboard shortcuts in <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/04/beeper-context-menu-wtf.png\">the contextual menu for the text editing field</a>?) Both are just big <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/04/beeper-memory.png\">bloated</a> Electron web apps pretending, by appearance, to be Mac apps. I feel like they should be merged, not that we’re losing a competition that offered </p>\n\n<p>As for iMessage, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2024/04/beeper-texts/\">here’s Matt Mullenweg</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A lot of people are asking about iMessage on Android… I have zero \ninterest in fighting with Apple, I think instead it’s best to \nfocus on messaging networks that want more engagement from \npower-user clients. This is an area I’m excited to work on when I \nreturn from my sabbatical next month. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Smart.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/11/automattic-beeper\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"24c51b1f229728628f426ed01fea5de3989a2231b02d40e35e076189928106cd","category":"Tech"}
