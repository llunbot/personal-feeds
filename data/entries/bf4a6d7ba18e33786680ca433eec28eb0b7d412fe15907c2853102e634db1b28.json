The report claims he left in January, but <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/phil-harrison-649b04a/details/experience/\">Harrison's Linkedin</a> was only updated in the last few days to say he left Google in April. Harrison spent five years working on Stadia.</p>\n<p>Google is not a gaming company, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nUih5C5rOrA\">kicked off</a> the launch of Google's gaming platform by announcing to the crowd, \"I'm not a big gamer.\" As Stadia's VP and general manager, Harrison was supposed to bring gaming credibility to Google, though. Harrison is an industry veteran that previously worked at Microsoft and Sony for their game console launches, so his experience was supposed to help the company set up deals with game developers and deal with the, uh, <em>enthusiastic</em> gaming community.</p>\n<p>In the early days, Harrison was the face of Stadia. During the initial 2019 announcement, Harrison took the stage <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nUih5C5rOrA?t=672\">after</a> Pichai to announce Stadia to the world, detailing the basic premise and how Stadia would be \"the future of games.\" When things started going south, though, Harrison stopped appearing in videos, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrphilharrison?lang=en\">stopped tweeting</a>, and generally disappeared. Harrison made the news rounds in 2021 when Google killed off Stadia's only first-party game studio, the Games &amp; Entertainment division, after just 1.5 years. Harrison <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/stadia-leadership-praised-development-studios-for-great-1846281384\">reportedly</a> told the team they were \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/google-praised-stadia-studio-for-great-progress-one-week-before-killing-it/\">making great progress</a>\" one week before they were laid off, which was, according to Kotaku, part of a pattern of leadership \"not being honest and upfront with the company's developers.\" He also announced the death of Stadia in a blog post.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929515#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929515&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bf4a6d7ba18e33786680ca433eec28eb0b7d412fe15907c2853102e634db1b28","category":"Tech"}
