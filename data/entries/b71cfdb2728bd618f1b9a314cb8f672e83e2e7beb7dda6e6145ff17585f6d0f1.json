A <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253028635\">post on Apple Support's Community Forums</a>, which has racked up over 900 views at the time of writing in just over 13 hours, also includes users reporting the bug.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe warning, however, is not the only storage-related bug that's irking some users. Other reports on Twitter indicate that ‌iOS 15‌ has resulted in a bug in which the amount of available storage on a device is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Angelo_Campher/status/1440603198062948352\">sometimes shown</a> to be more than the device's capacity. In other cases, an ‌iOS 15‌ bug results in the wrong tabulation for how much storage a user's content is taking up.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Ez <a href=\"https://t.co/sEpJvpmxnZ\">pic.twitter.com/sEpJvpmxnZ</a></p>— Pierre (@Chibibowa) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Chibibowa/status/1440006320095121414?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 20, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn all cases, Apple Support is advising users to restart their devices, but that does little to address the problem. Some of the bugs experienced by users appeared during the beta testing period for ‌iOS 15‌ over the summer, which is meant to fix as many bugs and issues as possible before the update becomes widely available.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis week, Apple began testing iOS and iPadOS 15.1; however, given the widespread nature of these bugs, Apple may decide to release iOS 15.0.1 to address the storage bug and other improvements and security enchantments.
