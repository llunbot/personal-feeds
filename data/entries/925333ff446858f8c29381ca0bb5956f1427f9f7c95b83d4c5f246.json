Given Apple's health objectives, he expects AirPods to take on these sorts of functions \"more officially\" in the near future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has previously highlighted the company's intention to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/airpods-health-tracking-features/\">add biometric health monitoring capabilities</a> to future AirPods models. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/11/15/apple-patent-airpods-biometric-sensors/\">patent filings</a> have described an earbud-based fitness monitoring system that integrates an advanced biometric sensor to detect physiological metrics including temperature, heart rate, perspiration levels and more, through skin contact and via built-in motion sensors. Apple's vice president of technology, Kevin Lynch, has also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/16/apple-executive-hints-airpods-health-data/\">hinted</a> that AirPods could be a source of additional health data in the future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNew hearing health capabilities would not necessarily be contingent on new AirPods being released, since current models already contain speakers and microphones to support such features, and they could be pushed to existing devices via a firmware update.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/12/gurman-airpods-to-gain-hearing-health-features/\">Gurman: AirPods to Gain Hearing Health Features Over the Next Two Years</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-airpods-to-gain-hearing-health-features-over-the-next-two-years.2383475/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"925333ff446858f8c29381ca0bb5956f1427f9f7c95b83d4c5f246","category":"Apple"}
