Together with the internal combustion engine version, it's the closest thing we'll get to a baby Bentley shooting brake, at least without <a href=\"https://spyscape.com/article/the-sultan-of-bruneis-unbelievable-car-collection\">being part of the Brunei royal family</a>. It's a handsome five-door that looks almost station wagon-ish, without actually succumbing to the retail poison that body style has sadly become.</p>\n<p>A station wagon G70, called the Shooting Brake, does exist—in Europe, anyway. But neither it nor the four-door sedan G70 are available with a battery electric powertrain. SUVs being popular helped in that regard. The vehicle starts at around the midpoint for a luxury electric SUV at $66,950; the Prestige trim we tried bumps that starting price to $73,750.</p>\n<p>Some people reflexively take offense on seeing those three letters, but this Electrified GV70 has been kept away from the growth hormones. It's identical in length to a Ford Mustang Mach-E, but here, we see one downside to the Electrified GV70's use of a common platform—the Genesis loses out to the Ford by four inches when we compare wheelbases.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/review-2025-genesis-electrified-gv70-is-charming-but-it-needs-updates/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/review-2025-genesis-electrified-gv70-is-charming-but-it-needs-updates/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
