Then the route follows the undulating Whole Lotta Lava (short), Figure 8 (standard), and Watopia Mountain (long) routes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key landmarks in Figure 8 include; the Hilly KOM (0.9km at 5.5%) and Hilly KOM Reverse (2.4km at 2%). These climbs date back to April 2015, making them the oldest climbs on Zwift. The JWB sprint is also featured in Figure 8 and Watopia Mountain routes. This is the oldest sprint on Watopia, named after Julynn Washington, a prominent early Zwifter. Watopia Mountain also includes the Epic KOM, at 9.5km, the longest climb on Zwift when it was introduced in March 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The standard (5km) and long (10km) run options feature Whole Lotta Lava sections.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Stage 2 – launching Tuesday, October 22nd (with live events available between 22-28 Oct): Jungle to Alpe du Zwift</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The tour heads into the Mayan Jungle on the short Jungle Circuit and standard Serpentine 8 routes. Both first appeared in October 2017. Riders must swap their road bikes with MTBs to complete this one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The long route, however, tackles the Road to Sky.  Featuring the fearsome Alpe du Zwift (12km at 8%), which debuted five years ago. It is modeled on the real-world Alpe d’Huez and features 21 leg-sapping hairpin bends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The standard (5km) and extended (10km) run options feature Road to Sky sections.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Stage 3 – launching Tuesday, October 29th (with live events available between 29 Oct-4 Nov): Fuego to Titans</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The tour travels east for stage three featuring; Tempus Fugit (short), Sand and Sequoias (standard), and Eastern Eight (long) cycle routes all visit the Fuego Flats Desert, which dates back to 2019. The two longest rides also head into the forest to scale the Titan’s Grove KOM (2.6km at 2.2%). While Eastern Eight incorporates the flat, underwater roads of Ocean Boulevard. Fun fact: Tempus Fugit is currently Zwift’s most popular route.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The standard (5km) and extended (10km) run options feature sections of Sand and Sequoias.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Stage 4 – launching Tuesday, November 5th (with live events available between 4-11 Nov): Southern Coast to The Grade</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking on the Going Coastal (short), Mayan 8 (standard), and Itza Party (long) routes for the penultimate stage of the tour. Both Going Coastal and Itza Party include the coastal road expansion that was first introduced in October last year. While Going Coastal has no climbs of note. Itza Party has four ascents, including a tricky summit finish on the Itza KOM (3.75km at 3%).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The standard (5km) and long (10km) run options both feature sections of Mayan 8.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Zwift 2024 Tour of Watopia <strong>Stage 5 </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Launching Tuesday, November 12th (with live events available between 12-18 Nov): To be revealed</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zwifters might have noticed something unusual appearing from the ocean, just off Watopia’s coast, in the last few weeks… <em><strong>Could they be ancient structures, more cobbles, or how about an ultimate show down with the final Zwift boss MVDP?</strong> </em>All will be revealed on Tuesday, November 12th, when stage five explores this new, exciting, and historic land.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Tour-of-Watopia-Zwift-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Tour-of-Watopia-Zwift-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Tour of Watopia Zwift\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Tour-of-Watopia-Zwift-jpg.webp 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Tour-of-Watopia-Zwift-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Tour-of-Watopia-Zwift-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Tour-of-Watopia-Zwift-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Tour-of-Watopia-Zwift-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Tour-of-Watopia-Zwift-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Reg is Open</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Registration for the Tour of Watopia is open now.
