During a teleconference with reporters, Bruno even went so far as to say that by the end of 2025, his company would launch a rocket every other week.</p>\n<p>But those plans came crashing down in late March when a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/04/ula-continues-investigation-of-centaur-stage-anomaly/\">large explosion</a> occurred on a test stand at Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama, where United Launch Alliance was pressure testing the upper stage of the Vulcan rocket. As part of the qualification test, the liquid hydrogen tank ruptured. Now <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/06/vulcan-rocket-completes-critical-test-but-launch-slipping-toward-end-of-2023/\">Vulcan's debut has slipped</a> into at least late summer and may not take place until the final months of this year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948924#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948924&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a69491eeed36408ef9f5a64e17f530bdcbc537d01369fa513b95b446efc12be9","category":"Tech"}
