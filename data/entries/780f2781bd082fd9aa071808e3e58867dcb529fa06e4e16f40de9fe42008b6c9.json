We‚Äôre into the first week of racing at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta a Espa√±a</a> with Primo≈æ Rogliƒç where he belongs in the red jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) won the Tour de Pologne with teammate Olav Kooij taking the win on the final stage. The Tour de l‚ÄôAvenir is ongoing; Italy‚Äôs Ludovico Crescioli broke away for victory on Stage 2 atop the Plateau d‚ÄôHauteville.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let‚Äôs delve into a cracking edition of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2024-reflections\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France Femmes</a> and huge track cycling gossip.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>ICYMI: Kasia Niewiadoma wins Tour de France Femmes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Kasia-Niewiadoma-and-Demi-Vollering-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Kasia-Niewiadoma-and-Demi-Vollering-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Kasia-Niewiadoma-and-Demi-Vollering-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Kasia-Niewiadoma-and-Demi-Vollering-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Kasia-Niewiadoma-and-Demi-Vollering-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Kasia-Niewiadoma-and-Demi-Vollering-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Kasia-Niewiadoma-and-Demi-Vollering-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Kasia-Niewiadoma-and-Demi-Vollering-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Kasia-Niewiadoma-and-Demi-Vollering-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Kasia-Niewiadoma-and-Demi-Vollering-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Kasia-Niewiadoma-and-Demi-Vollering-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Julien De Rosa/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Four seconds was the winning margin of the 2024 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2024-gallery\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France Femmes</a> ‚Äì the tightest in Tour history across the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs races. Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon-SRAM) won the <em>maillot jaune</em> ahead of Demi Vollering (SD Worx-Protime) in a tight finish decided on the summit of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/alpe-d-huez-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Alpe d‚ÄôHuez</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vollering had lost the yellow jersey after a chaotic late crash on Stage 5. Despite trying hard on the final day of racing and breaking away with Pauliena Rooijakkers (Fenix-Deceuninck), ten bonus seconds on the line from the stage win would not be enough to top Niewiadoma in the standings. Rooijakkers completed the podium ten seconds behind Niewiadoma.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niewiadoma was dropped on the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/col-du-glandon-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Col du Glandon</a> but fought back to win her first Tour de France Femmes ‚Äì also as the first non-Dutch rider to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the finish, she said, ‚ÄòThroughout my whole career there were so many times I missed out on victories. I feel like this week was perfect for me and my team. To be able to win big races, you need everything on your side.‚Äô</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2024-reflections\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France Femmes reflections: Winners, losers and future stars</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-prize-money-2024\">Who won the most prize money at the Tour de France Femmes 2024?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2024-gallery\">The best photos from the Tour de France Femmes 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2024-reflections\">Tour de France Femmes reflections: Winners, losers and future stars</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cycling-transfer-rumours\">Pro cycling transfers 2024/2025: Alaphilippe signs for Tudor, Hayter to Quickstep and Markus to Lidl-Trek</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Matthew Richardson swaps Australia for Great Britain</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>British-born sprint cyclist Matt Richardson will be joining the Great Britain Cycling Team programme after being successful in his application for change of nationality via the UCI.<br /><br />Welcome to the team, Matt <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f44b.png\" alt=\"üëã\" /></p>‚Äî British Cycling (@BritishCycling) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BritishCycling/status/1825465297748275274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">August 19, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Track sprinter Matthew Richardson has switched to the Great Britiain Cycling Team from Australia. Born in Maidstone, Kent, Richardson moved to Australia at nine years old, maintaining dual citizenship. He has changed his nationality via the UCI and will be part of GB‚Äôs sprint squad. The 25-year-old recently won two silvers and one bronze medal at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/olympics\" target=\"_blank\">Paris Olympics</a> for Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking on the move, he said, ‚ÄòSwitching nationality was a difficult decision, and not one I took lightly. It was a personal choice, made after careful consideration of my career and future. It‚Äôs not something I decided on quickly or easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄòThis decision is about following my passion and pushing myself to new heights. This isn‚Äôt about leaving something behind, but about embracing a new chapter in my journey and chasing a dream, a dream that is to race for the country in which I was born.‚Äô</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Per regulations, Richardson cannot race the 2024 World Championships or 2025 European Championships.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Julian Alaphilippe signs with Tudor Pro Cycling</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>Loulou or Juju, call him as you wish!

The Swiss squad is a UCI ProTeam and have riders such as Matteo Trentin, Alberto Dainese and Michael Storer on their roster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It marks the end of a decade-long partnership between Alaphilippe and Soudal-QuickStep that included Tour de France stage victories, an almost yellow jersey win, a Monument and much more. Things soured in the last few seasons however, with team boss Patrick Lefevere publicly criticising his rider and even hitting out at Alaphilippe‚Äôs wife, Tour de France Femmes race director Marion Rousse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the move, Alaphilippe said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôve got a lot of experience and that can be important for the young people in the team. It‚Äôs a great motivation to bring what I know and my way of being on and off the bike. It really motivates me to win races and develop at the highest level, both personally and with the team.‚Äô</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year has seen a more rejuvenated Alaphilippe. He won Stage 12 of the Giro d‚ÄôItalia in classic Alaphilippe fashon to complete the set of a victory in each Grand Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He‚Äôs not the only one on the move. Ethan Hayter takes his spot on Soudal-QuickStep from Ineos Grenadiers, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>See you next week.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-prize-money-2024\">Who won the most prize money at the Tour de France Femmes 2024?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2024-gallery\">The best photos from the Tour de France Femmes 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2024-reflections\">Tour de France Femmes reflections: Winners, losers and future stars</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cycling-transfer-rumours\">Pro cycling transfers 2024/2025: Alaphilippe signs for Tudor, Hayter to Quickstep and Markus to Lidl-Trek</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-news-matthew-richardson\">Pro Log: Track sprinter Matthew Richardson switches from Australia to Great Britain, Julian Alaphilippe signs with Tudor Pro Cycling and Tour de France Femmes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"780f2781bd082fd9aa071808e3e58867dcb529fa06e4e16f40de9fe42008b6c9","category":"Cycling"}
