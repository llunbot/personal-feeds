Delta was therefore made available on the App Store as a <a href=\"http://&lt;a href=\">free download</a> in the United States and other countries on April 17, with users supporting the developer via <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/rileyshane\">Patreon</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nDelta has been hugely popular since its debut on the App Store and the emulator has been a constant presence in the Top Charts, with users flocking to play retro games that originally appeared on NES, SNES, N64, Nintendo DS, Game Boy, and Game Boy Advance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote> <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@rileytestut/post/C6RxU_rOLeP\" target=\"_blank\"> <div><div>  </div> <div> Post by @rileytestut</div> <div> View on Threads</div></div></a></blockquote>\r<br />\n</div>\r<br />\nDelta works with popular game controllers, and supports cheats, save states, backups, syncing, and more. Other features include an option to fast forward, a \"hold\" button for games where a button needs to be consistently held, support for Haptic Touch, and box art for imported games. Local multiplayer gaming is available on iPhone, and up to four players can participate. A future version of Delta will also include SEGA Genesis support, according to Testut. \r<br />\n\r<br />\niPad support will arrive when Delta 1.6 hits the App Store, but <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/rileyshane?utm_source=search\">Patreon supporters</a> don't have to wait and can grab Delta 1.6 now. <br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/delta-game-emulator-coming-to-ipad/\">Popular Delta Retro Game Emulator Coming to iPad</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/popular-delta-retro-game-emulator-coming-to-ipad.2425122/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"41e9f5c7cfa41368640e20e2401aa43525b5912837e0ba66a4919088445fad50","category":"Apple"}
