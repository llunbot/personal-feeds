{"title":"Fitting Facts to the Narrative at The Washington Post","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/05/02/apple-sales-ai-iphone-earnings-regulations/","date":1715019892000,"content":"\n<p>From a Washington Post story headlined “Apple Is Behind in AI and Killed Its Self-Driving Car Project. What’s Next?”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The company’s Greater China region, which encompasses mainland\nChina, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, has long been one of Apple’s\nmost crucial growth zones. But growing pressure from a handful\nlocal rivals — including Shenzhen-based Huawei, which surmounted\nU.S. sanctions aimed at slowing its advance in late 2023 by\n<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/09/14/us-sanctions-china-huawei-mate-60-pro-smic/?itid=lk_inline_manual_25\">producing a smartphone with a domestically made\nprocessor</a> — cut sharply into Apple’s market share in the\nregion earlier this year.</p>\n\n<p>Data from market research firm Counterpoint Research indicated\nthat Apple’s sales in China dipped by nearly 20 percent in the\nfirst quarter of 2024, a shift that senior research analyst Ivan\nLam attributed partially to “Huawei’s comeback.”</p>\n\n<p>The full scope of the company’s decline in China became clear\nThursday, when Apple reported an 8 percent revenue dip compared to\na year earlier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s inexplicable that the Post included a paragraph with projections from Counterpoint claiming iPhone sales in China were down 20 percent even after Apple reported its actual results for the quarter. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/05/parsing-apples-quarterly-statements-from-ai-to-india/\">Jason Snell, over at Six Colors</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Finally, I particularly enjoyed the exchange between Wells Fargo’s\nAaron Rakers and Cook in which Rakers asked Cook to explain\nApple’s results compared to the data reported by independent\nresearch groups that suggested iPhone sales were falling apart in\nChina. Apple’s actual numbers weren’t that bad, and in fact, Apple\ntrumpeted how well the iPhone was going in urban China.</p>\n\n<p>“I can’t address the data points,” Cook said. “I can only address\nwhat our results are, and you know, we did accelerate last\nquarter. And iPhone grew in mainland China, so that’s what the\nresults were. I can’t bridge to numbers we didn’t come up with.”</p>\n\n<p>That’s about as savage a shade-throwing as you’ll get on an Apple\nanalyst call.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>iPhone <em>grew</em> in mainland China last quarter but even after Apple announced that — in a legally-binding context — they went with made-up projections from Counterpoint to fit their narrative that Apple is in trouble.</p>\n\n<p>While I’m being grumpy, I’ll even take issue with the notion — which the Post leads with in its headline — that Apple is “behind in AI”? It is true that Apple doesn’t offer an AI chat product like <a href=\"https://openai.com/chatgpt\">OpenAI’s ChatGPT</a>, <a href=\"https://copilot.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft’s Copilot</a>, or <a href=\"https://gemini.google.com/app\">Google’s Gemini</a>. But do we expect Apple <em>ever</em> to offer such a project? Apple doesn’t have a web search engine but no one is arguing that Apple is “behind” on search. (App Store search results quality is another issue.) Apple doesn’t offer turnkey cloud computing services like AWS or Google Cloud either. Are they “behind” on that? When it comes to the products Apple already sells, how are they “behind on AI”? Are iPhone users missing out on AI features available only to Android users? No. Are MacBook users missing out because Apple hasn’t <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/01/04/introducing-a-new-copilot-key-to-kick-off-the-year-of-ai-powered-windows-pcs/\">added a dedicated AI key to their keyboards</a>?</p>\n\n<p>I get it that people see AI as a frontier that is transforming the industry, and Apple hasn’t revealed any new plans or features yet. But I’d say Apple is <em>silent</em> on AI, not <em>behind</em>. When iOS and Mac users are missing out on features that are only available on other platforms, that’s when I’d say Apple is behind.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/06/fitting-facts-to-the-narrative-at-the-washington-post\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6dd97fb6490d404dc36208b8fd65b356702e668f6704c85f2d1cc83735880ab2","category":"Tech"}
