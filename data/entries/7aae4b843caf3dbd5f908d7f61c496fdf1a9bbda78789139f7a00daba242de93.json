Even with their own <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/eb17-3t-strada-bailout-overdrive-cassettes-shift-approach-1x-road/\" target=\"_blank\">unique cassettes</a> and a bit of <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/aqua-blue-will-race-3t-strada-1x11-aero-road-bike-pro-peloton/\" target=\"_blank\">Aqua Blue pro road racing</a> on the 1x setup, it was soon evident that roadies just weren’t ready for 1x. And a year later 3T acquiesced with a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/3t-strada-due-adds-front-derailleur-to-fat-tire-aero-road-bike-by-popular-demand/\" target=\"_blank\">2x compatible version</a> of their road bike. The 1x was still there, but it was clear that the market wasn’t quite ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, earlier this summer, 3T rolled out an all-new lighter Strada <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2024-3t-strada-italia-aero-wide-tire-carbon-road-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">made in Italy</a>. It aerodynamics ratcheted performance up a notch, with deeper &amp; wider tubes, fully integrated cable routing, and mega 35mm tire clearance. But it still had a 2x drivetrain, although with a bolt-on front derailleur tab that hinted a 1x build would be coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/3T-Strada-Italia-Red-Xplr-1x13-speed-aero-road-bike-with-1x-gravel-race-groupset-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/3T-Strada-Italia-Red-Xplr-1x13-speed-aero-road-bike-with-1x-gravel-race-groupset-jpg.webp\" alt=\"3T Strada Italia Red Xplr 1x 13-speed aero road bike, SRAM Red AXS XPLR gravel race groupset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/3T-Strada-Italia-Red-Xplr-1x13-speed-aero-road-bike-with-1x-gravel-race-groupset-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/3T-Strada-Italia-Red-Xplr-1x13-speed-aero-road-bike-with-1x-gravel-race-groupset-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/3T-Strada-Italia-Red-Xplr-1x13-speed-aero-road-bike-with-1x-gravel-race-groupset-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/3T-Strada-Italia-Red-Xplr-1x13-speed-aero-road-bike-with-1x-gravel-race-groupset-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/3T-Strada-Italia-Red-Xplr-1x13-speed-aero-road-bike-with-1x-gravel-race-groupset-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Matching up the new aero road bike’s even bigger tires on wide &amp; deep aero wheels and its even deeper aerodynamic tube shapes, this new Strada Italia features a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-red-xplr-13-speed-groupset/\" target=\"_blank\">1×13-speed Red Xplr groupset</a> with tighter gearing steps but a wide 460% (10-46T) spread that rivals modern 2x setups.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3T Strada Italia 1x – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/3T-Strada-Italia-SRAM-Red-Xplr-1x-13-speed-aero-road-bike_3T-Discus-45-32-wheels-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/3T-Strada-Italia-SRAM-Red-Xplr-1x-13-speed-aero-road-bike_3T-Discus-45-32-wheels-jpg.webp\" alt=\"3T Strada Italia Red Xplr 1x 13-speed aero road bike with 3T Discus 45|32 wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/3T-Strada-Italia-SRAM-Red-Xplr-1x-13-speed-aero-road-bike_3T-Discus-45-32-wheels-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/3T-Strada-Italia-SRAM-Red-Xplr-1x-13-speed-aero-road-bike_3T-Discus-45-32-wheels-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/3T-Strada-Italia-SRAM-Red-Xplr-1x-13-speed-aero-road-bike_3T-Discus-45-32-wheels-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/3T-Strada-Italia-SRAM-Red-Xplr-1x-13-speed-aero-road-bike_3T-Discus-45-32-wheels-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/3T-Strada-Italia-SRAM-Red-Xplr-1x-13-speed-aero-road-bike_3T-Discus-45-32-wheels-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new 1x 3T Strada Italia essentially comes in just <a href=\"https://3t.bike/collections/strada-1#shopify-section-template--22231026958670__featured_collection_yMJcfB\" target=\"_blank\">one premium, ultra-expensive build</a> since its key component is SRAM’s top-tier wireless gravel group and 3T’s handmade <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/factory-tour-inside-3t-cycling-how-torno-carbon-cranks-are-handmade-in-italy-more/\" target=\"_blank\">Italian carbon Torno crankset</a> or a Red powermeter.
