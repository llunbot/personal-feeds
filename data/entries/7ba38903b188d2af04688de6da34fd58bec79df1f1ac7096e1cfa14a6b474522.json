But it's fair to say that the world's largest automaker has been left behind in the shift toward battery EVs.</p>\n<p>That situation looks like it's set to change. On Tuesday, Toyota announced that it will spend $13.6 billion (¥1.5 trillion) on batteries between now and 2030. Of that money, $9 billion (¥1 trillion) will go toward battery production, with a planned output of 180 to 200 GWh/year by the end of the decade.</p>\n<p>\"What Toyota values the most is to develop batteries that its customers can use with peace of mind. Especially, we are focusing on safety, long service life, and high-level quality to produce good, low-cost, and high-performance batteries,\" said Chief Technology Officer Masahiko Maeda.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792771#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792771&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
