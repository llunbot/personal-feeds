The standard Biturbo X features a generous rider+gear weight limit of 115kg/254lb. Bike Ahead says that’s perfect for taller &amp; heavier riders, plus riders on the latest crop of lightweight eMTBs. The Xes weigh about 330g more than the ultralight Biturbo RS XC wheels. But are rated for smashing much rougher trails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you ride a heavier full-power, big battery gravity ebike, there’s also a Biturbo X.E version that adds another 300g of carbon reinforcement.

Together with custom cargo bike shop <a href=\"https://kvirder.de/\" target=\"_blank\">Kvirder</a> in Frankfurt. Back then, Kvirder asked Bike Ahead founder Christian Gemperlein if he would consider making a cargo version of the Biturbo. And he jumped at the idea. By 2022, they’d built a wheel tough enough to pass DIN testing for heavier cargo bikes and high-speed cargo pedelec ebikes. And shed a lot of weight vs. conventional alloy cargo bike wheelsets, often over 2kg for a set.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bike-Ahead-Biturbo-Cargo-ultralight-ultra-strong-6-spoke-monocoque-carbon-wheels-for-cargo-ebikes_20in-26in-wheelset.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bike-Ahead-Biturbo-Cargo-ultralight-ultra-strong-6-spoke-monocoque-carbon-wheels-for-cargo-ebikes_20in-26in-wheelset.jpg\" alt=\"Bike Ahead Biturbo Cargo ultralight ultra-strong 6-spoke monocoque carbon wheels for cargo ebikes, 20&quot;

The 6-spoke carbon front wheel is just 635g, the rear 900g, for a complete wheelset of only 1535g.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bike-Ahead-Biturbo-Cargo-ultralight-ultra-strong-6-spoke-monocoque-carbon-wheels-for-cargo-ebikes_rear-wheel-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bike-Ahead-Biturbo-Cargo-ultralight-ultra-strong-6-spoke-monocoque-carbon-wheels-for-cargo-ebikes_rear-wheel-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Bike Ahead Biturbo Cargo ultralight ultra-strong 6-spoke monocoque carbon wheels for cargo ebikes, detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bike-Ahead-Biturbo-Cargo-ultralight-ultra-strong-6-spoke-monocoque-carbon-wheels-for-cargo-ebikes_rear-wheel-detail.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bike-Ahead-Biturbo-Cargo-ultralight-ultra-strong-6-spoke-monocoque-carbon-wheels-for-cargo-ebikes_rear-wheel-detail-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bike-Ahead-Biturbo-Cargo-ultralight-ultra-strong-6-spoke-monocoque-carbon-wheels-for-cargo-ebikes_rear-wheel-detail-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bike-Ahead-Biturbo-Cargo-ultralight-ultra-strong-6-spoke-monocoque-carbon-wheels-for-cargo-ebikes_rear-wheel-detail-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bike-Ahead-Biturbo-Cargo-ultralight-ultra-strong-6-spoke-monocoque-carbon-wheels-for-cargo-ebikes_rear-wheel-detail-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bike-Ahead-Biturbo-Cargo-ultralight-ultra-strong-6-spoke-monocoque-carbon-wheels-for-cargo-ebikes_rear-wheel-detail-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bike-Ahead-Biturbo-Cargo-ultralight-ultra-strong-6-spoke-monocoque-carbon-wheels-for-cargo-ebikes_rear-wheel-detail-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bike Ahead says their design with most of the rotating mass located near the center of the wheel is especially well suited for the start-and-stop riding dynamic of a cargo bike. They go as far as to say that upgrading to these wheels “<em>not only saves leg power, but also battery capacity on e-bikes</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bike-Ahead-Biturbo-Cargo-ultralight-ultra-strong-6-spoke-monocoque-carbon-wheels-for-cargo-ebikes_by-Kvirder_complete-long-john.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1350\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bike-Ahead-Biturbo-Cargo-ultralight-ultra-strong-6-spoke-monocoque-carbon-wheels-for-cargo-ebikes_by-Kvirder_complete-long-john.jpg\" alt=\"Bike Ahead Biturbo Cargo ultralight ultra-strong 6-spoke monocoque carbon wheels for cargo ebikes, by Kvirder, complete long john\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bike-Ahead-Biturbo-Cargo-ultralight-ultra-strong-6-spoke-monocoque-carbon-wheels-for-cargo-ebikes_by-Kvirder_complete-long-john.jpg 1350w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bike-Ahead-Biturbo-Cargo-ultralight-ultra-strong-6-spoke-monocoque-carbon-wheels-for-cargo-ebikes_by-Kvirder_complete-long-john-297x158.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bike-Ahead-Biturbo-Cargo-ultralight-ultra-strong-6-spoke-monocoque-carbon-wheels-for-cargo-ebikes_by-Kvirder_complete-long-john-800x427.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bike-Ahead-Biturbo-Cargo-ultralight-ultra-strong-6-spoke-monocoque-carbon-wheels-for-cargo-ebikes_by-Kvirder_complete-long-john-120x64.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bike-Ahead-Biturbo-Cargo-ultralight-ultra-strong-6-spoke-monocoque-carbon-wheels-for-cargo-ebikes_by-Kvirder_complete-long-john-768x410.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wildly light full-carbon monocoque cargo bike wheels made in Germany don’t come cheap, though. They sell for the same 3600€ as many of the other Biturbos. But, there’s probably no way to make your cargo bike as cool looking.
