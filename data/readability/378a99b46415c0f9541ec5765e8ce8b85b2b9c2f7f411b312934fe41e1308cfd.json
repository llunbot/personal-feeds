Some turn to headphones to drown out monotonous road noise, while others keep their ears clear to ensure they are aware of traffic and potential road hazards.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Whether you’re a commuter, dedicated roadie or mountain bike trail bomber, wind noise is something you’re going to encounter.

They fit like sleeves over your helmet straps, acting as a buffer between your ears and the elements. The point is to create a dead zone in the air around your ears. The result? Over 80% reduced wind noise, according to the company.</span></p><h2>Wind-Blox Building Blocks</h2><p><span>Wind-Blox look and function like microphone covers, fitting snugly on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/07/14/safest-bike-helmets-for-road-and-mountain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">helmet</a> straps just in front of the ears. The pads deflect wind without blocking out the ambient noise riders need to hear, providing a quiet ride in the process.</span></p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/09225359/wind_classic.png\" alt=\"windblox helmet strap covers\" width=\"511\" height=\"447\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/09225359/wind_classic.png 511w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/09225359/wind_classic-297x260.png 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/09225359/wind_classic-120x105.png 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/09225359/wind_classic-480x420.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/09225359/wind_classic.png\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/09225359/wind_classic.png 511w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/09225359/wind_classic-297x260.png 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/09225359/wind_classic-120x105.png 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/09225359/wind_classic-480x420.png 480w\"></p><p><span>Engineer Mike Fajen created Wind-Blox in 2010 after becoming concerned with his hearing during his 13-mile bicycle commute into Portland, Oregon.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The product is similar to </span><a href=\"https://www.cat-ears.com/\"><span>Cat-Ears AirStreamz</span></a><span>, which are furry strap covers that work the same way. Wind-Blox look lower-profile, with sports fabric on the exterior, rather than the fuzz of AirStreamz. They also feature reflective fabric for added safety, and are machine washable.</span></p><h2>Wind-Blox Helmet Strap Covers: Safety and Hearing</h2><p><span>Even at leisurely speeds, gusting winds can completely block out noise coming from the road, your own bike or other riders. The effect creates a frustrating nuisance at best, and a serious safety concern at worst.</span></p><p><span>Aside from immediate safety concerns, cyclists could face serious medical issues resulting from prolonged and repeated exposure to wind. Wind noise is so common and constant, many riders don’t think about it — even though it can be deafening.</span></p><p><span><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/09225404/wind_pro.png\" alt=\"windblox helmet strap covers\" width=\"511\" height=\"447\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/09225404/wind_pro.png 511w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/09225404/wind_pro-297x260.png 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/09225404/wind_pro-120x105.png 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/09225404/wind_pro-480x420.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/09225404/wind_pro.png\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/09225404/wind_pro.png 511w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/09225404/wind_pro-297x260.png 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/09225404/wind_pro-120x105.png 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/09225404/wind_pro-480x420.png 480w\">According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.noisyplanet.nidcd.nih.gov/have-you-heard/wind-noise-can-contribute-to-noise-Induced-hearing-loss-in-cyclists\"><span>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</span></a><span>, wind noise can reach up to 85 decibels at 15 mph, and up to 120 decibels at 60 mph.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://www.chem.purdue.edu/chemsafety/Training/PPETrain/dblevels.htm\"><span>Purdue University</span></a><span> equates 85 decibels to the sound of a blender or milling machine.
