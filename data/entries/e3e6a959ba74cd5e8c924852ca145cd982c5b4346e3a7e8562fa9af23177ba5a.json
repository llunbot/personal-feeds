That's the question the universe set out to answer when it aligned in such a way that famed (or perhaps infamous) car customizer Mansory got itself a Tesla Cybertruck. The Mansory Elongation—a name that must have taken ages to think of—offers exterior, interior, and wheel and tire upgrades for the straight-edged stainless steel-wrapped pickup.</p>\n<p>Among those who mod cars, there are the tuners, who focus on adding power and (one hopes) performance, and then there are the customizers, who concentrate more on aesthetics. Once upon a time, the entire luxury car industry worked like that—a client would buy a rolling chassis from Bugatti, Rolls-Royce, or Talbot and then have bodywork added by coachbuilders like Gurney Nutting, Touring, or Figoni et Falaschi.</p>\n<img width=\"2560\" height=\"1708\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MANSORY_ELONGATION05-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"The rear 3/4 view of a modified Cybertruck\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MANSORY_ELONGATION05-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MANSORY_ELONGATION05-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MANSORY_ELONGATION05-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MANSORY_ELONGATION05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MANSORY_ELONGATION05-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MANSORY_ELONGATION05-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MANSORY_ELONGATION05-980x654.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MANSORY_ELONGATION05-1440x960.jpg 1440w\" />\n      At least the rear winglets don't entirely compromise access to the bed.\n        Credit:\n          Mansory\n      \n<p>Modern homologation requirements have mostly put an end to that level of coachbuilding, but for the ultra-wealthy prepared to spend telephone numbers on cars, brands like Rolls-Royce will still occasionally oblige. More common now are those aftermarket shops that spiff up already luxurious cars, changing normal doors for gullwing versions, adding flaring fenders and bulging wheel arches, and plastering the interior in any hue of leather one might imagine.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/yes-it-turns-out-you-can-make-a-tesla-cybertruck-even-uglier/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/yes-it-turns-out-you-can-make-a-tesla-cybertruck-even-uglier/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
