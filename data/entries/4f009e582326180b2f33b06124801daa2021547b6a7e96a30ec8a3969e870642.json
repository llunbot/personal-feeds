The sharp decline highlights how the Trump administration's aggressive tariffs campaign – which peaked with 145% levies on Chinese goods – is disrupting tech supply chains and diverting electronics production elsewhere.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSmartphones represented one of the three biggest US imports from China last year, alongside laptops and lithium-ion batteries.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe decline comes as Apple has been actively expanding production in India. In the fiscal year ending March, Apple's iPhone production in India reached $22 billion, a nearly 60% increase compared to the previous year. The company had been planning to import most US-bound iPhones from India by the end of next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, during his recent state visit to Qatar, President Trump <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/trump-tells-apple-stop-building-iphones-india/\">revealed</a> he had asked Apple CEO Tim Cook to halt the company's manufacturing expansion in India. \"I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,\" Trump said. \"He is building all over India.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen asked about the supply chain's future during the company's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/apple-2q-2025-earnings/\">recent earnings call</a>, Cook said: \"What we learned some time ago, having everything in one location had too much risk with it. We have, over time, with certain parts of the supply chain, opened up new sources of supply. You could see that kind of thing continuing in the future.\"\r<br />\n<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/chinese-iphone-shipments-us-2011-lows/\">Chinese iPhone Shipments to US Plunge to 2011 Lows Amid Trade Tensions</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chinese-iphone-shipments-to-us-plunge-to-2011-lows-amid-trade-tensions.2457383/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4f009e582326180b2f33b06124801daa2021547b6a7e96a30ec8a3969e870642","category":"Apple"}
