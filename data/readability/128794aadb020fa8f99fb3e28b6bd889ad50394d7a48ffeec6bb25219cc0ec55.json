It ended atop the very podium he apparently didn’t believe in, after an hour spent proving stratospheric form.</p><p>“I had not expected this at all, of course not,” Van Aert said after the finish.</p><p>The Belgian national champion (CX and road) attacked on lap two of the incredibly muddy Boom course. He was soon joined by Toon Aerts (Baloise Trek Lions), but when the latter crashed on a slimy corner, Van Aert lit it up again, and that was it.</p><p>“I felt really good, so I was able to move up quickly,” Van Aert described the fast start to the race. “Then I suddenly saw that I had a big gap, because I did not see the fall of Toon Aerts. I thought I would make a difference with him.”</p><p>By the end of the third lap, the Jumbo-Visma rider already had almost a minute over his nearest rivals, and that gap only grew as the laps chugged by. </p><p>“Eventually I had to downshift a gear, but I still turned out to be faster than the rest.”</p><p>Van Aert carried 1:59 into the penultimate lap, which came in handy when he slid out on a muddy downhill section and landed heavily on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/12/cervelo-r5-cx-a-cyclocross-race-bike-designed-for-vos-and-van-aert/\">his brand new bike</a>. He got up pretty quick, slung his Cervelo R5-CX over his shoulder and ran it into the nearby pits. </p><p>“The crash at the end was because I was starting to get tired,” he said. “I had a nice lead, but it is dangerous to lose concentration. Oh yes, that is part of it.”</p><p>Toon Aerts rallied after his earlier misfortune to drop his fellow chasers and finish second, 1:40 behind Van Aert, and Lars van der Haar (Baloise Trek Lions) crossed the line third. Also making his first appearance this cyclocross season was Tom Pidcock (Ineos Grenadiers) who managed seventh after suffering several wearing crashes, like almost everybody else.</p><p>Van Aert was, quite simply, a level above the competition who barely saw him all race. It bodes well for the rest of <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/11/vos-and-van-aert-will-race-a-packed-cx-program-to-prepare-for-road-classics/\">his ‘cross program</a>.</p><p>“I don’t think I should draw conclusions but the start is better than I hoped,” Van Aert said. “It’s good to know all these hours in the rain this week haven’t been for nothing.”</p></div></div>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"128794aadb020fa8f99fb3e28b6bd889ad50394d7a48ffeec6bb25219cc0ec55","category":"Cycling"}
