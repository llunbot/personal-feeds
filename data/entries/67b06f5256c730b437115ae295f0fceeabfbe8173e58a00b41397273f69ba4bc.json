{"title":"Perhaps Acquiring Pixelmator Is Not About Competing With Photoshop and Lightroom, Per Se, but the Adobe Creative Cloud Bundle","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2023/05/09/final-cut-pro-logic-ipad-subscription-price/","date":1732562298000,"content":"\n<p>Zac Hall, writing at 9to5Mac back in May 2023:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now that Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for iPad are\n<a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/05/09/final-cut-pro-logic-ipad/\">official</a>, let’s talk about pricing. These apps coming out\non a random day in May is surprising. Subscription pricing? Not so\nmuch. Nevertheless, pricing for these long overdue apps is\ninteresting when you consider their Mac counterparts and the Apple\nOne bundle.</p>\n\n<p>First, let’s address the Mac apps.</p>\n\n<p>How would Apple price Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for Mac if they\nwere released today? In the era of service revenue, Apple would\nalmost certainly charge a subscription fee for access rather than\na one-time fee.</p>\n\n<p>Mac users have had years of free updates to Logic and Final Cut\nPro after paying once for each app. In fact, Logic Pro X will be a\ndecade old in July, and Final Cut Pro X turns 12 next month. The\nprice of Logic Pro for Mac today ($199.99) is the same as four\nyears of subscribing to Logic Pro for iPad, and Final Cut Pro for\nMac ($299.99) will equal six years of paying for the iPad version.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The iPad versions of <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro-for-ipad/id1631624924\">Final Cut Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/logic-pro-for-ipad/id1615087040\">Logic Pro</a> are both priced the same: $5/month or $50/year. There is no bundle to get both at a discount.</p>\n\n<p>I was a little surprised when Apple <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/11/final-cut-pro-11-begins-a-new-chapter-for-video-editing-on-mac/\">announced Final Cut Pro 11 for Mac two weeks ago</a> and didn’t announce a switch to subscription pricing. Instead, it remains a $300 one-time purchase, and for existing users version 11 is a free upgrade. Whether you like it or not, subscription pricing is no longer the future, it’s the present, and it’s the dominant model for professional creative tools today.</p>\n\n<p>Adobe made this switch years ago, with a particular emphasis on <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.html\">the Creative Cloud bundle</a> that includes their entire suite of apps — Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere Pro, Audition, Acrobat Pro, and more. You get access to Adobe’s entire suite for $90/month, or $60/month if you pay annually ($720/year). They currently offer a first-year 50 percent discount if you pay annually. A la carte, subscriptions to each app cost $20–$23/month, so the Creative Cloud bundle is a good deal if you use three of them, and a great deal if you use more than three.</p>\n\n<p>Apple clearly understands the appeal of subscription bundles too, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-one/\">with Apple One</a>. Despite the fact that Apple didn’t switch to subscription pricing for Final Cut Pro 11 for Mac, I still expect them to sooner rather than later, and if they do, I further expect a bundle. Apple is never going to offer a swath of creative tools as broad as Adobe’s, but the biggest missing pieces right now would be alternatives to Photoshop and Lightroom. My gut feeling is <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/apple_tends_to_do_right_by_apps_it_acquires\">that’s why</a> they <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/01/pixelmator-apple\">acquired Pixelmator and Photomator</a>. They could sell a bundle for, just spitballing here, $20/month or $200/year that would include the Mac and iPad versions of Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator, and possibly Photomator. Maybe throw in some extra iCloud storage.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/25/apple-creative-cloud\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"67b06f5256c730b437115ae295f0fceeabfbe8173e58a00b41397273f69ba4bc","category":"Tech"}
