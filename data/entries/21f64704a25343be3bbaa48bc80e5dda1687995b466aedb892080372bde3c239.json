But the net profit, once generally accepted accounting measures were applied, fell by 55 percent to $1.1 billion. (Non-GAAP net profit was down 48 percent.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019595#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019595&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
