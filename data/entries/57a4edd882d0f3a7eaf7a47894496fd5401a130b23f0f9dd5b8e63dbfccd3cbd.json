The latest products to die are third-party Google Assistant smart displays. <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2023/04/07/google-assistant-smart-displays-updates/\">9to5Google</a> was the first to spot this quietly posted notice on a <a href=\"https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/9071980\">Google Duo support page</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Important: Google no longer provides software updates for these third-party Smart Displays: Lenovo Smart Display (7″, 8″ &amp; 10″), JBL Link View and LG Xboom AI ThinQ WK9 Smart Display. This could impact the quality of video calls and meetings.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We're pretty sure that announcement applies to every third-party Google Smart Display that has ever launched, so the product line is dead. Google's first-party smart displays, the Google Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max, aren't going anywhere and will now be the only options on the market.</p>\n<p>Google Smart Displays put the Google Assistant on a screen and support all the same commands that a Google Assistant speaker like the Google Home or Nest Audio would; just shout \"Hey Google,\" and it will attempt to recognize your command. The screen adds the ability to see a visual accompaniment to your search results, usually either some text, a photo slideshow, a timer, or media or smart home controls. The system is a touchscreen and has a really basic user interface that you can swipe around in without needing to talk to it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930416#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930416&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"57a4edd882d0f3a7eaf7a47894496fd5401a130b23f0f9dd5b8e63dbfccd3cbd","category":"Tech"}
