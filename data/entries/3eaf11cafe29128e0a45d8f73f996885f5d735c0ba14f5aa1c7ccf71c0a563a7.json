I’m not sure whether that’s an achievement or a cry for help.</p>\n<p>Extending my collection past one of my favourite writers in Sebastian Fitzek, I’ve thrown myself head first into a new wave of various authors that mostly come from the £5 section at Sainsburys.</p>\n<p>Since my last In the Drops I absorbed <em>Thirteen</em> by Steve Cavanagh, where the serial killer is on the jury as opposed to being the one on trial, <em>The Dinner Guest</em> by B.P. Walter in which only three out of four people make it out of a dinner alive, <em>The Woman on the Pier</em> also by B.P. Walter and <em>The Silent Patient</em> from Alex Michaelides.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/12/56a7e2ef-db05-4a49-938c-73c8b21784a7_0.jpg?itok=3ZWmyj9K\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>I just finished A.J. Finn’s <em>The Woman in the Window</em>. This thriller centres on Anna Fox, who spends her days trapped inside, drinking wine and spying on her neighbours. I feel slightly attacked.</p>\n<p>One night she witnesses a horrific crime, but it’s not clear if this even happened or was simply a figment of her imagination.</p>\n<p>My next is <em>Every Last Secret</em> from A.R. Torre – a women's infatuation with her neighbour's husband turns deadly. Hopefully this one isn't relatable...</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/12/00dfb806-271f-4694-82d9-4c34bdf1a5ba.jpg?itok=TnzqFo3W\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>So let me know your newest reads on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robynjournalist\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and we can get a little book club going. We don’t have to be in possession of the same one, I just love knowing what interests other people in literature.</p>\n<p>Right – I’m off to finish my book. Be on your best (worst) behaviour over the Christmas period everyone and I’ll see you soon. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"rdavidson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"3eaf11cafe29128e0a45d8f73f996885f5d735c0ba14f5aa1c7ccf71c0a563a7","category":"Cycling"}
