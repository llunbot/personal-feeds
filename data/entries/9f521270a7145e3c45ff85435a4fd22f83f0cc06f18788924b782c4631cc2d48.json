Those flows include increasing surges of cold and fresh water from melted ice, and a new <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-109-2024\">study in the journal Weather and Climate Dynamics</a> shows how those pulses can set off a chain reaction from the ocean to the atmosphere that ends up causing summer heatwaves and droughts in Europe.</p>\n<p>The large new inflows of fresh water from melting ice are a relatively new ingredient to the North Atlantic weather cauldron, and based on measurements from the new study, a currently emerging “freshwater anomaly” will likely trigger a drought and heatwave this summer in Southern Europe, said the study’s lead author, Marilena Oltmanns, an oceanographer with the United Kingdom’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NOCnews\">National Oceanography Centre</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007381#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007381&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Inside Climate News","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9f521270a7145e3c45ff85435a4fd22f83f0cc06f18788924b782c4631cc2d48","category":"Tech"}
