Modern systems will give you plenty of range both for getting up hills and faster riding.</p>\n<p>Single-ring systems, known as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/1x-drivetrains/\">1x drivetrains</a>, are becoming increasingly popular on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bikes</a> and can be found fitted to road bikes, too.</p>\n<p>Combined with the cassette, the number of teeth on the crankset’s chainrings will define your bike’s gearing. However, chainring sizes vary significantly, with options for every type of riding, so we’ll cover them separately below.</p>\n<p>The chainrings are usually bolted onto arms that protrude from the right-hand crank arm, also called a spider. There are exceptions though, which we’ll come on to.</p>\n<p>You can’t easily swap the number of chainrings your bike is set up for, because the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/sram-and-shimano-front-derailleur-types-and-mounts-explained/\">front derailleur</a> and associated shifter will be specific for your setup and would need to be replaced, too.</p>\n<p>Power meters incorporated into the crankset’s arms or spider are popular with performance-focused road cyclists (and some mountain bikers and gravel riders, too). Pedal-based power meters are also popular.</p>\n<p>There is a wide range of power meter models available – read our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-power-meters/\">best power meters</a> – but they are pricey and you may need specialist tools to fit them in place of your bike’s existing crankset.</p>\n<h2>Swapping chainring sizes</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rotor aero chainring\" title=\"Rotor aero chainring\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Swapping chainring sizes is possible, but compatibility needs to be considered.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Swapping chainring sizes on a double or triple crankset isn’t as simple as it sounds, because specific chainrings are designed to work together, with tooth positioning and ramps on the rings there to help the chain shift smoothly.</p>\n<p>A mismatched pair of rings might make for particularly awkward shifts from the small to the large ring and there’s an increased risk of the chain falling off the rings altogether, whether you’re shifting up or down.</p>\n<p>Groupset brands also recommend a maximum difference in the number of chainring teeth that a front derailleur can deal with, so you can’t usually increase the jump between rings.</p>\n<p>Also, the teeth on a chainring are sized for the number of gears on your bike so you can’t, for example, use an 8-speed chainring with an 11-speed chain, because the teeth would be too wide in that instance.</p>\n<p>If you do want to swap chainring sizes, check for compatibility beforehand.</p>\n<p>It is a lot simpler, though, on a single-ring setup, with only chain length needing much consideration.</p>\n<h2>Crank lengths</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rotor Aldhu Carbon Cranks\" title=\"Rotor Aldhu Carbon Cranks\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Crank arms are available in a variety of lengths.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A variety of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/what-is-the-best-crank-length-for-cycling/\">crank lengths</a> are available.</p>\n<p>The shortest is usually 165mm (measured from the centre of the bottom bracket to the centre of the pedal spindle) and they increase in 2.5mm increments up to 175mm, although there are exceptions that go longer.</p>\n<p>The most common length found on mid-sized road bikes tends to be 172.5mm, while mountain bikes most often have 170mm or 175mm cranks.</p>\n<p>Longer crank arms give you more leverage.

On a 110mm BCD crankset, the lower limit drops to 33t, and so on.</p>\n<p>In some older systems, the BCD varied between chainring sizes, so a Shimano 53/39t road crankset had a different BCD (130mm) to a 50/34t (110mm), meaning you couldn’t swap between them without replacing the entire crankset.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Shimano Dura-Ace R9200 crankset and front derailleur on Colnago V4RS\" title=\"Colnago V4RS\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> All new Shimano road cranksets have a BCD of 110mm, which enables you to select a full range of chainrings without swapping your crankset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>That’s changed with newer Shimano road cranksets, which have settled on 110mm BCD for all chainring sizes, giving you the option to increase or decrease your chainring sizes without having to change the cranks as well.</p>\n<p>SRAM’s crankset BCDs vary between setups, though. A 12-speed <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-force-etap-axs-review/\">SRAM Force eTap AXS</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-rival-etap-axs-review/\">SRAM Rival eTap AXS</a> two-ring crankset and single-ring crankset both have a 107mm BCD, but a SRAM Force Wide double has a 94mm BCD.</p>\n<p>Drop to 11-speed and the BCD for a Force crankset goes out to 110mm or 130mm, dependent on chainring compatibility. There’s a different BCD again for SRAM’s non-direct mount S-650 Eagle MTB crankset – 104mm. That means there’s limited interchangeability between SRAM chainrings.</p>\n<p>In some setups, the BCD arrangement is even more complicated. The inner chainring is sometimes fitted to the inside of the outer ring, or separately onto the crank spider.</p>\n<p>This setup uses a second BCD for the inner ring that’s different from the outer ring’s BCD. An example is the Shimano GRX gravel groupset, where the outer ring’s BCD is 110mm and the inner ring’s 80mm.</p>\n<h3>Direct-mount cranksets</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"SRAM Force AXS groupset\" title=\"SRAM Force AXS groupset - 05\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Direct-mount cranks promise to be lighter because there are fewer parts.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Finally, there are an increasing number of ‘direct-mount’ cranksets, where the outer chainring fixes directly to the crankset spindle, eliminating the bolts in the arms and saving weight.</p>\n<p>This system is common on single-ring mountain and gravel cranksets. Again, there’s limited compatibility between different brands’ systems.</p>\n<p>Some SRAM cranksets, such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/sram-force-axs-2023-review/\">Force AXS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-12-speed-red-etap-axs-hrd-review/\">Red eTap AXS</a> have direct-mount systems with the two chainrings CNC machined from a single piece of aluminium.</p>\n<p>SRAM says this improves shifting and chain management because the chainring is stiffer, though it does mean you need to change the entire set should one chainring wear out.</p>\n<p>Cannondale’s SpiderRings are similar, except the chainrings are forged rather than machined.</p>\n<h2>Bottom bracket standards</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"This is the ultimate guide to bottom brackets\" title=\"01_ultimate_guide_to_bottom_brackets-1552559704935-kk78dn83ckn0-65e4441\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There are many different bottom bracket standards.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The next complication is the huge number of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">bottom bracket standards</a>.</p>\n<p>This can cover the distance between the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bicycle-bearings-everything-you-need-to-know/\">bearings</a> in the bottom bracket shell, how they’re secured in the bike frame and the diameter of the crankset’s spindle.</p>\n<p>A road crankset typically won’t fit in an MTB bottom bracket and vice versa, although this is not a hard and fast rule.</p>\n<p>It’s even more complex because there are different standards within both <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/mountain-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">mountain bike groupsets</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/road-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">road groupsets</a>. Some are inter-compatible, most aren’t, although you can buy adaptors for some combinations.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking to swap your crankset, it’s best to establish the standard used in your bike and stick to that, or seek advice from a professional in a bike workshop.</p>\n<p>The width of your bottom bracket shell is the major determinant of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/stance-width-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-care/\">stance width</a> or ‘Q-factor’. That’s the distance between your pedals and is a factor in pedalling efficiency.</p>\n<p>In general, road cranksets have a narrower Q-factor than mountain bikes, because the latter are designed for larger tyre clearances. The rise of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bikes</a> and the trend towards wider tyres on road bikes is muddying the waters here, though.</p>\n<h2>Crankset types – road vs MTB vs gravel</h2>\n<p>Crankset designs vary depending on the type of riding they are intended for.

Its road bike groupsets use a 10-tooth smallest cog on its cassettes. This provides more overall range compared to the 11-tooth small cog on Shimano groupsets. This enables SRAM to use smaller chainrings to provide equivalent gearing. For example, 50/37t is the largest double crankset size on its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-12-speed-red-etap-axs-hrd-review/\">Red eTap AXS groupset</a>.</p>\n<h3>‘Semi-compact’ double crankset</h3>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure>\n<div>\n    \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2022/03/52-36-Campagnolo-crankset-89abf6b.jpeg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"52-36 Campagnolo crankset\" title=\"52-36 Campagnolo crankset\" />\n</div>    <figcaption>\n        <div>\n    <figcaption>\n        <span>A 52/36t chainring combination provides a middle-ground between a standard double and compact crankset.</span>\n    </figcaption>\n    <span>\n                    <i>Josh Evans / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      </div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure>\n<div>\n    \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2022/03/SRAM-Red-eTap-chainrings-e1648724651831.jpeg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"SRAM Red eTap crankset with 48/35t chainrings\" title=\"SRAM Red eTap crankset with 48/35t chainrings\" />\n</div>    <figcaption>\n        <div>\n    <figcaption>\n        <span>48/35t is SRAM’s equivalent to a 52/36t crankset.</span>\n    </figcaption>\n    <span>\n                    <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Leaving pro-level bikes to one side, more sporty road bikes will now typically come with a 52/36t crankset.</p>\n<p>It’s called a ‘semi-compact’ and gives you slightly lower top-end gears than a 53/39, but opens up more low-range options for tackling hills. 48/35t is SRAM’s 12-speed equivalent to a semi-compact.</p>\n<h3>‘Compact’ double crankset</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Racers interested in the Madone 9.0 might want to swap out the compact 50/34 crank\" title=\"trek-madone-9.0-12-1505154139489-8fiq05gx5yw8-bb33444\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A compact will make your gears lower if you’re using the same cassette.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ben Delaney / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Finally, there’s the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-a-compact-crank/\">compact crankset</a>.

With that in mind, it’s now much more common to see <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/road/super-compact-chainsets-the-next-big-thing-for-road-cyclists/\">super-compact cranksets</a> (also called sub-compact cranksets) on gravel bikes with two chainrings.</p>\n<p>These usually have either 46/32t or 46/30t chainrings, although Shimano GRX also offers 48/31t.</p>\n<p>This gives you lower ratios, below 1:1 with the right cassette, which should enable you to tackle harder off-road conditions or load up your bike for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/heres-what-you-need-for-a-bikepacking-adventure/\">bikepacking</a>.</p>\n<p>1x cranksets are also a popular option for gravel bikes, because eliminating the front derailleur makes for a simpler mechanical setup and the bigger jumps between gears are less of a problem for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/what-is-gravel-riding/\">gravel riding</a>. 36t, 38t, 40t or 42t single chainrings are all commonly available.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo Ekar offers 13 speeds and the smallest sprocket on the cassette has nine teeth. It’s single-ring only, with four crankset options between 38 and 44 teeth.</p>\n<h2>Mountain bike cranksets</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"SRAM X1 crank on Lapierre Prorace\" title=\"SRAM X1 crank on Lapierre Prorace\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Mountain bike chainrings have fewer teeth than road chainrings, to provide lower off-road gearing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Like road and gravel bikes, mountain bikes come with a broad range of different crankset options.</p>\n<p>Nearly every new mountain bike now has a single-ring crankset, except at the very entry-level, making use of a cassette with a very large range to cut down on front-end complexity in the drivetrain.</p>\n<p>Shimano offers four levels of 1×12 drivetrain, from <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/shimano-deore-m6100-groupset-review/\">Deore</a> through <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/shimano-slx-m7100-groupset-review/\">SLX</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/shimano-deore-xt-m8100-review/\">XT</a> and up to the top-of-the-range <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/shimano-xtr-m9100-review/\">XTR groupset</a>, though this is expected to change with the introduction of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/shimano-cues-u8000/\">Shimano Cues</a>.</p>\n<p>But you don’t have to have a single-ring setup and you can get a number of 2x setups across the ranges. Some 11-speed Shimano groupsets are still available too.</p>\n<p>SRAM also majors on single rings across its mountain bike range, from SX Eagle through to the flagship <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-xx-t-type-eagle-transmission-powermeter-axs-review/\">XX T-Type Eagle Transmission</a>.</p>\n<p>The Eagle moniker represents the American company’s wide-ranging, 12-speed, single-ring only groupsets. Its top-end XX T-Type Eagle crankset is available with 32, 34, 36 or 38-tooth chainrings, while the cheaper lines tend to offer a subset of these sizes, usually 30, 32 or 34-teeth.</p>\n<p>Two-ring SRAM options in the GX-1000 model include a 36/22t 11-speed crankset, with the additional option of 38/24t chainrings in 10-speed. The budget S-200 offers a 42/32/22t triple chainset with 9-speed gearing.</p>\n<p>With different axle-width standards used on different mountain bikes, the chainline is important, too. Because the cassette is a different distance from the centreline of the bike with different standards, the chainring needs to be a different distance from the axis too in order to run smoothly across the range of gears.</p>\n<p>Some brands offer different chainline options for their cranksets to accommodate these different axle widths, and you need to choose the right one for your bike.</p>\n<h2>Cyclocross cranksets</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Silver coloured cyclocross bike from Ribble\" title=\"Ribble CX SL Pro\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Many cyclocross bikes now have single-ring setups but some, such as this Ribble, still have 2x cranksets.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robert Smith</i></span></div>\n<p>Single chainrings have taken over on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cyclocross-bikes/\">cyclocross race bikes</a> in a big way for the same reason that they’re popular for gravel: there’s less to go wrong in the muddy conditions of a cyclocross race, plus you can fit a chain guide to reduce the risk of a dropped <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bicycle-chains/\">chain</a>.</p>\n<p>The classic cyclocross setup is a 46/36t two-ring groupset, with the smaller jump between chainrings making for more assured shifting.

The key here is finding the right combination of chainring size and rear sprocket to provide the gear ratio you need for your riding style and terrain.</p>\n<p>Fixies (fixed gears) and track bikes have singlespeed drivetrains without a freewheel – that means if the rear wheel is moving, so are your legs.</p>\n<h2>Crankset alternatives</h2>\n<h3>Elliptical rings</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"OSymetric chainrings on Chris Froome's Team Sky Pinarello Dogma\" title=\"OSymetric chainrings on Chris Froome's Team Sky Pinarello Dogma\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Chris Froome used OSymetric chainrings en route to winning the 2015 Tour de France.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ben Delaney / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As well as standard round chainrings, you can buy elliptical rings. They were a big deal in the pro ranks a few years ago, used by Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome, among others, although they’re not so popular now.</p>\n<p>The aim is to make pedalling smoother, with the effective gear ratio changing as the crank rotates. The theory here is it makes it easier to pedal through the dead spots at the top and bottom of the pedal stroke.</p>\n<p>If you want to try elliptical rings, it’s important to ensure they’re compatible with your crank arms.</p>\n<h3>Belt drives</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Shand Leveret road bike uses a belt drive instead of a chain\" title=\"Shand Leveret 04\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A Gates belt drive means no oily marks on your trousers.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As for other alternatives, not all bikes have a standard toothed crankset.</p>\n<p>A belt drive is sometimes found on city bikes.

It may require specialised tools too, so again it’s probably worth leaving it to the professionals.</p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"efb4508e8ab274ba0dbd11bb1e303500f872af937699d2585cbb88286d945dc8","category":"Cycling"}
