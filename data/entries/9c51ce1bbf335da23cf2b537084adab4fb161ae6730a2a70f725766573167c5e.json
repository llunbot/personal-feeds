These protections also bring the state and the country closer to meeting its goals to protect 30 percent of land and water before 2030 to address climate change. The designation will honor Tribal sovereignty and support the priorities of Tribal Nations who still reside in the area. The two national monuments are part of living landscapes with spiritual significance and interconnected cultural and natural resources that continue to sustain the well-being and survival of Indigenous peoples today.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Moab_To_Mojave.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Moab_To_Mojave.png?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Moab_To_Mojave.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Moab_To_Mojave.png?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>The Chuckwalla National Monument solifies the Moab to Mojave corridor.
