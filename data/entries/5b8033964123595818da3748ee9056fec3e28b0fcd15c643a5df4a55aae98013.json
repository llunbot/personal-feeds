Then there are some—many of them regular readers and commenters on this site—who could not only care less about the latest white plastic IoT thingy, but actively avoid such things.</p>\n<p>I get it: If it connects to Wi-Fi, it requires signing up for an account, and there's a chance the company selling it could go bust at any time. It's also a no-go for anyone who cares about security or who just wants simplicity. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/matter-and-thread-could-fix-smart-home-compatibility-but-dont-get-excited-yet/\">The Matter standard</a> is supposed to solve exactly this problem, but its real implementation and impact have been slow and underwhelming.</p>\n<p>This is why I'm writing about just one set of gear while it's on sale for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/shopping/2023/07/amazon-prime-day-2023-deals/\">Prime Day</a> (even if you're not a Prime subscriber): SwitchBot. I didn't use SwitchBot stuff until recently, but now that I have, it's what I'd recommend to anybody who just wants to make a few things in their home easier to turn on, turn off, or automate. There are no voice controls, no AI, just buttons and switches that do what you tell them.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1953164#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1953164&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5b8033964123595818da3748ee9056fec3e28b0fcd15c643a5df4a55aae98013","category":"Tech"}
