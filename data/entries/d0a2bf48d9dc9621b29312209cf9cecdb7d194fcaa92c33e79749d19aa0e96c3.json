The new CR or Corrosion Resistant bearings claim to be “the first ever to combine a hardened, corrosion-resistant steel race with ceramic bearings and condition-specific seals.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Bearings_no_seals-001.jpg-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Bearings_no_seals-001.jpg-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Kogel CR Bottom bracket bearing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Bearings_no_seals-001.jpg-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Bearings_no_seals-001.jpg-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Bearings_no_seals-001.jpg-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Bearings_no_seals-001.jpg-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Bearings_no_seals-001.jpg-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Bearings_no_seals-001.jpg-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Bearings_no_seals-001.jpg-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Bearings_no_seals-001.jpg-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Kogel founder Ard Kessels states that, ”Kogel has always offered different seals for wet or dry conditions, and we’ve always used chrome steel for our ceramic bearings. With our new proprietary, hardened stainless steel races, we can now offer cyclists the longest lasting and smoothest, best-protected bearings available.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Kessels, most bearings utilize a chrome steel which is extremely hard and durable, but susceptible to rust. Alternatively, some manufacturers rely on stainless steel for races that won’t rust, but it’s softer and wears faster especially when used with ceramic balls. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kogel claims that their new proprietary hardening process for stainless steel yields a race that is hard enough to survive prolonged use with their ceramic balls but retains its rust-proofing. Combine that with seal options for both wet and dry conditions, and you should have a corrosion resistant bearing that will last through many seasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kogel-CR-bearings-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kogel-CR-bearings-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Kogel CR Bottom bracket\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kogel-CR-bearings-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kogel-CR-bearings-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kogel-CR-bearings-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kogel-CR-bearings-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kogel-CR-bearings-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kogel-CR-bearings-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kogel-CR-bearings-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Kogel is confident enough in their new bearing tech to have extended their warranty with a new “3-year very few questions asked” policy. The new CR bearings are available now as an upgrade in all bottom brackets and will come standard in aftermarket fully wheels and oversized pulleys in the Colossus derailleur cage. Kogel will also sell CR bearings as aftermarket upgrades for existing components with more applications coming in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pricing varies by component, but using a BSA DUB bottom bracket as an example, the standard ceramic BB is currently on sale for $237.99. If you add the CR bearing upgrade, the price jumps to $324.99. Definitely a premium, but if the bearings last as long as they promise, it could be worth the upgrade. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kogel.cc\" target=\"_blank\"><em>kogel.cc<br /></em></a><br /></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/kogel-corrosion-resistant-ceramic-bearings-hardened-stainless-races/\">Kogel Claims First Corrosion Resistant Bearings w/ Multi-Condition Seals</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"d0a2bf48d9dc9621b29312209cf9cecdb7d194fcaa92c33e79749d19aa0e96c3","category":"Cycling"}
