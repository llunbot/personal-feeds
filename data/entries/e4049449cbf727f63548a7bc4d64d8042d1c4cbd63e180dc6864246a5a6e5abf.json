It may say “Install Now” if the update was already downloaded in the background but not yet applied, or “Download and Install” if you haven’t even downloaded it yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just follow the instructions there to upgrade to iOS 18. You may need to re-agree to terms and conditions, and it will take several minutes to download, verify, and apply. Then your iPhone will restart, and you’ll be presented with some welcome screens that introduce new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the iOS 18 release candidate you need to register for and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671198/how-to-install-ios-beta.html\">download the beta</a>. If you haven’t already, though, we suggest simply waiting for the final release which is right around the corner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you install an update and want to revert to the previous version there is a very small window in which you can do that, but it can be done, read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2020596/downgrade-iphone-older-version-ios.html\">How to downgrade iOS</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e4049449cbf727f63548a7bc4d64d8042d1c4cbd63e180dc6864246a5a6e5abf","category":"Apple"}
