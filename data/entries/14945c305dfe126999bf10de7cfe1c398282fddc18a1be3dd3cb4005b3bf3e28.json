At least two of the organizations, the European Union's Copernicus and Berkeley Earth, place the year at about 1.6° C above pre-industrial temperatures, marking the first time that the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5° has been exceeded.</p>\n<p>NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration both place the mark at slightly below 1.5° C over pre-industrial temperatures (as defined by the 1850–1900 average). However, that difference largely reflects the uncertainties in measuring temperatures during that period rather than disagreement over 2024.</p>\n<h2>It’s hot everywhere</h2>\n<p>2023 had set a temperature record largely due to a switch to El Niño conditions midway through the year, which made the second half of the year <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/01/first-results-are-in-2023-temperatures-were-stunningly-warm/\">exceptionally hot</a>.
