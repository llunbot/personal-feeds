The Off-Road Equipment clothing is divided into three lines; Access, Ultralight, and Trail. It’s worth noting these categories are a bit blurry and not specific to different riding disciplines, in fact, Velocio suggests mixing and matching pieces from each. Basically, no matter what terrain you ride, any line might have something for you – and that’s regardless of gender too, as all the new items come in men’s and women’s models.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Off-Road-Equipment-guy-woman.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Off-Road-Equipment-guy-woman-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Velocio Off-Road Equipment, man and woman\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Off-Road-Equipment-guy-woman-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Off-Road-Equipment-guy-woman-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Off-Road-Equipment-guy-woman-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Off-Road-Equipment-guy-woman-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Off-Road-Equipment-guy-woman-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Off-Road-Equipment-guy-woman.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new clothing offers the fit and performance of high-end racing gear, but with subtle styling that looks good on your local trails. Instead of Velocio’s usual tricolor flag and ‘Ci’ logo, the Off-Road gear will bear a new mountain label and revised logo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you like supporting sustainable practices, you’ll be happy to know this; Velocio not only makes their clothing with recycled materials and natural ethically sourced fibers, but they also use compostable packaging and offer repair services for their garments. All items in the new MTB collection are also PFA/PFC free.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Trail ACCESS Hardshell jacket – $389</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-ACCESS-hardshell-jacket-front.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-ACCESS-hardshell-jacket-front-800x800.jpg\" alt=\"Velocio Trail ACCESS Hardshell Jacket, front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-ACCESS-hardshell-jacket-front-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-ACCESS-hardshell-jacket-front-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-ACCESS-hardshell-jacket-front-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-ACCESS-hardshell-jacket-front-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-ACCESS-hardshell-jacket-front.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While most of the new Off-Road Equipment pieces are available now, The Trail ACCESS Hardshell jacket will be released in late September. Velocio’s most advanced MTB outer layer, the Trail ACCESS Hardshell Jacket is made for the harshest conditions, starting with a Pertex Shield Air three-layer outer fabric. This fabric offers 10k waterproofing and 30k breathability, plus mechanical stretch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trail ACCESS Hardshell Jacket is lightweight and packable, and offers a relaxed pre-shaped cut. Its hood is helmet-compatible and multi-point adjustable, and the low-profile sleeve cuffs are designed to work well with or without gloves.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-ACCESS-hardshell-jacket-back.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-ACCESS-hardshell-jacket-back-800x800.jpg\" alt=\"Velocio Trail ACCESS Hardshell Jacket, back\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-ACCESS-hardshell-jacket-back-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-ACCESS-hardshell-jacket-back-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-ACCESS-hardshell-jacket-back-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-ACCESS-hardshell-jacket-back-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-ACCESS-hardshell-jacket-back.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For storage, you get two zippered pockets on the front (with laser-cut vents inside), a zippered internal pocket with a media port, and a back pocket with a waterproof zipper. That’s all the info we have on this item for now!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Trail ACCESS Pant – $199</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Off-Road-Equipment-Arcade-belt.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Off-Road-Equipment-Arcade-belt-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Velocio Off-Road Equipment, Arcade belt\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Off-Road-Equipment-Arcade-belt-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Off-Road-Equipment-Arcade-belt-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Off-Road-Equipment-Arcade-belt-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Off-Road-Equipment-Arcade-belt-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Off-Road-Equipment-Arcade-belt-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Off-Road-Equipment-Arcade-belt.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of devising a waist-cinching system, Velocio went with an idea that might sound odd at first; All new Velocio off-road pants and shorts come with belt loops and special edition matching belts from Velocio/Arcade. Who wants to ride with a belt, you might think? It’s not so crazy with Arcade’s belts, which feature low-profile buckles and stretch fabrics.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Access-pant-front.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Access-pant-front-800x800.jpg\" alt=\"Velocio Trail ACCESS Pant\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Access-pant-front-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Access-pant-front-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Access-pant-front-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Access-pant-front-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Access-pant-front.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trail ACCESS pant is a lightweight yet durable pant designed for year-round riding. They are constructed from two Italian-milled Cordura fabrics; The main one is a lightweight double-weave fabric, and high-wear areas get a ripstop weave fabric. The pants are coated with a C0 DWR treatment for water resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Velocio kept the pants’ seams to a minimum and designed the pockets to minimize movement from whatever items you’re carrying. The pants feature a pre-shaped cut that allows room for kneepads, and the legs taper down to the ankles.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Access-pant-back-wmns.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Access-pant-back-wmns-800x800.jpg\" alt=\"Velocio Trail ACCESS Pant, back, wmns\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Access-pant-back-wmns-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Access-pant-back-wmns-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Access-pant-back-wmns-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Access-pant-back-wmns-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Access-pant-back-wmns.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Color options for men’s and women’s models are Black or Dark Olive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Trail ACCESS Short – $179</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Access-short-front-wmns.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Access-short-front-wmns-800x800.jpg\" alt=\"Velocio Trail ACCESS short, front, wmns\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Access-short-front-wmns-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Access-short-front-wmns-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Access-short-front-wmns-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Access-short-front-wmns-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Access-short-front-wmns.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trail ACCESS Short is a durable option for the trails or the bike parks. The main fabric is a stretch-woven double-weave Cordura, which remains fairly lightweight at 170gsm. The shorts are C0 DWR treated, and like the pants above Velocio has avoided extra seams wherever possible. The shorts offer extended front leg panels to prevent kneepad gaps, and two extra deep zippered front pockets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are four color options for men or women; Black, Black Cherry, Army, and Moonrock.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Ultralight Trail Hooded jacket – $189</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-Hooded-jacket-front.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-Hooded-jacket-front-800x800.jpg\" alt=\"Velocio Ultralight Trail Hooded jacket, front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-Hooded-jacket-front-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-Hooded-jacket-front-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-Hooded-jacket-front-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-Hooded-jacket-front-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-Hooded-jacket-front.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ultralight Trail Hooded jacket is light but could be layered for any time of year, and is made from windproof and water-resistant Pertex Quantum Air fabric. This fabric is very lightweight (50gsm), offers all-around stretch, and is air-permeable to ensure good breathability. It also comes treated with a C0 DWR finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-Hooded-jacket-back-wmns.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-Hooded-jacket-back-wmns-800x800.jpg\" alt=\"Velocio Ultralight Trail Hooded jacket, back, wmns\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-Hooded-jacket-back-wmns-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-Hooded-jacket-back-wmns-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-Hooded-jacket-back-wmns-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-Hooded-jacket-back-wmns-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-Hooded-jacket-back-wmns.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ultralight Trail Hooded Jacket provides an articulated, pre-shaped cut for excellent mobility. There’s also an elastic hood that fits over a helmet. There’s a zippered pocket on the back, an internal pocket with a media port for storage. The front zipper is a two-way type for versatile venting or fit options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Men’s and ladies’ color options are Charcoal, Fire Red or Moonrock.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Ultralight Trail Short – $159</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Ultralight-shorts-side-wmns.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Ultralight-shorts-side-wmns-800x800.jpg\" alt=\"Velocio Ultralight Trail short, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Ultralight-shorts-side-wmns-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Ultralight-shorts-side-wmns-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Ultralight-shorts-side-wmns-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Ultralight-shorts-side-wmns-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Ultralight-shorts-side-wmns.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ultralight Trail shorts offer a ‘barely there’ feel with an Italian Ultralight Stretch woven fabric weighing in at 115gsm. The shorts offer a streamlined, pre-shaped fit designed for unrestricted pedaling motion. Velocio says they will accommodate low-profile kneepads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These shorts are C0 DWR treated, and feature the same minimized seam construction and pockets. The pockets help keep your cargo from moving around as the Trail ACCESS pants. Color options (men’s and women’s) are Black, Light Olive, or Black Cherry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ultralight clothing line also includes the Indigo Dye Ultralight Trail jersey (check out Velocio’s website for info on the jerseys).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Trail Mesh Bib Liner – $129</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Mesh-bib-liner.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Mesh-bib-liner-800x800.jpg\" alt=\"Velocio Trail Mesh Bib Liner\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Mesh-bib-liner-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Mesh-bib-liner-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Mesh-bib-liner-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Mesh-bib-liner-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Velocio-Trail-Mesh-bib-liner.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Last up, the Trail Mesh Bib Liner provides saddle comfort while keeping you as cool as possible. These bibshorts use the same top-notch dual-density chamois found in Velocio’s Signature bibs. Of course, you’ll also find the brand’s proven fit, straps, and leg grippers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Velocio bibs are light &amp; cool with full mesh construction and microfiber strap uppers; even the two cargo pockets on the outsides of both legs are made of mesh.
