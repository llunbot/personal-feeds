Het Nieuwsblad reports, however, that the Belgian WorldTour outfit and the 36-year-old Manxman are still “far apart” on some things in the proposed deal, while Lefevere described the “difficult” nature of agreeing on terms in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.hln.be/wielrennen/ook-met-nieuw-contractvoorstel-blijft-het-water-diep-tussen-lefevere-en-cavendish-nu-begint-hij-tegen-mij-over-zijn-imago~aa855835/\" target=\"_blank\">Het Laatste Nieuws</a>.</p><p>Specifically, Cavendish and the team have not come to an accord on his proposed salary, and Cavendish is also reportedly seeking assurances about racing next year’s Tour de France.</p><p>Cavendish, who is tied with Eddy Merckx for the all-time lead in Tour de France stage wins, joined Deceuninck-QuickStep at the start of this season on a one-year deal. He had previously ridden for the organization from 2013 to 2015, and then rode with Dimension Data for four seasons before spending 2020 with Bahrain-McLaren. His return to Lefevere’s squad came after after several years with limited results; when he made his first start with the team, it had been just over three years since his last pro win in February of 2018.</p><p>Cavendish put up some strong showings early on this season however, winning four stages at the Tour of Turkey, and then took a win ahead of a solid sprint field at the Baloise Belgium Tour in June. When Sam Bennett was scratched from the Deceuninck-QuickStep Tour de France roster, Cavendish was slotted in to the lineup, and he went on to take four stage victories at the race, tying Merckx’s all-time record. As such, a year after saying that he might have to retire, Cavendish now finds himself sorting out his contract situation for 2022.</p><p>Het Nieuwsblad reports that a deal with Deceuninck-QuickStep would largely be structured around bonuses, but that the talks have been “difficult” lately as both sides have been unable to agree on terms.</p><p>“He’s now starting to talk to me about his image,” Lefevere said, according to Het Laatste Nieuws. “He says, ‘Because of my image I am worth so much.’ I say, ‘Your image in London is different from your image in West Flanders, with all due respect.’ None of my West-Flemish sponsors are going to make amends to pay Mark Cavendish a higher wage for his image.”</p><p>The Tour de France is another point of contention. After his four-win performance in this year’s race, Cavendish might seem like an obvious choice to lead the team in the French Grand Tour in 2022, but Deceuninck-QuickStep had been planning to give more opportunities to Fabio Jakobsen, who recently won three stages at the Vuelta a España but has yet to make his Tour debut.</p></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"e20d9e261cbdf898334f3605e33632038a58892dfda1339d87a18d7e47f99682","category":"Cycling"}
