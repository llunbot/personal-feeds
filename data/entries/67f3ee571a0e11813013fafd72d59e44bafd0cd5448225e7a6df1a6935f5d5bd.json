Grynbaum, John Koblin, and Benjamin Mullin, reporting for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“CNN and Don have parted ways,” Chris Licht, CNN’s chairman, said\nin a statement. “Don will forever be a part of the CNN family, and\nwe thank him for his contributions over the past 17 years. We wish\nhim well and will be cheering him on in his future endeavors.”</p>\n\n<p>That benign language contrasted sharply with Mr. Lemon’s\ninterpretation of the day’s events. In a scathing message on\nTwitter, Mr. Lemon told viewers that he was abruptly informed by\nhis talent agent “that I have been terminated by CNN.”</p>\n\n<p>“I am stunned,” Mr. Lemon wrote. “After 17 years at CNN I would\nhave thought that someone in management would have had the decency\nto tell me directly. At no time was I ever given any indication\nthat I would not be able to continue to do the work I have loved\nat the network.” (CNN disputed Mr. Lemon’s account, saying the\nanchor “was offered an opportunity to meet with management but\ninstead released a statement on Twitter.”)</p>\n\n<p>In a clear sign of acrimony, Mr. Lemon has retained the aggressive\nHollywood litigator Bryan Freedman to handle his exit. His\ncontract with CNN runs through 2026, according to two people with\ndirect knowledge of his deal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/YahooFinance/status/1650579357751218176\">Brian Stelter</a>: “It’s the craziest day in cable news history.”</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/24/cnn-lemonade\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"67f3ee571a0e11813013fafd72d59e44bafd0cd5448225e7a6df1a6935f5d5bd","category":"Tech"}
