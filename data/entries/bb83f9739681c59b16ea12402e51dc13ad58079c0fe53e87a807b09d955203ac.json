The pump is powered by the wheel’s motion.</p>\n<p>Affini seems to be using the KAPS system in Team Jumbo-Visma’s usual wheels, though for consumers the technology appears only to be available in a Gravaa wheelset. The R-40|44 road version costs €4,299.</p>\n<h2>Why would riders need to adjust their tyre pressure on the move?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The adjustable tyre pressure system has made its professional racing debut.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tim de Waele / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>While it’s certainly an emerging technology, an adjustable tyre pressure system seems best-suited to cobbled Classics such as Dwars Door Vlaanderen, if it is going to take off at all.</p>\n<p>The early-season races of Belgium and northern France alternate between smooth tarmac and bone-jarring cobbles, where lower tyre pressures are commonly acknowledged to be faster and provide better traction and comfort.</p>\n<p>Could Team Jumbo-Visma be giving KAPS a whirl before the two cobbled Monuments, the Tour of Flanders on Sunday and Paris-Roubaix the following weekend?</p>\n<p>Professional riders have been progressively lowering their <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/road-bike-tyre-pressure/\">tyre pressures</a> for the Hell of the North in recent years, thanks in part to the adoption of wider tyres and tubeless technology.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/lizzie-deignan-paris-roubaix-femmes/\">Lizzie Deignan won the Queen of the Classics</a> with reportedly just 33psi in her <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless tyres</a>.</p>\n<p>KAPS could, in theory, enable a rider to drop their pressure even lower ahead of key cobbled sectors, such as the Forest of Arenberg.</p>\n<p>This could be especially valuable in the wet. In the same year as Deignan’s victory, Gianni Moscon was leading the men’s race solo before crashing following a bike change. Eurosport commentators speculated that excessive tyre pressure on his spare bike reduced his grip on the wet pavé.</p>\n<p>Prior to last year’s Paris-Roubaix, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/wireless-e3998-tyre-pressure-control-system-to-be-used-at-paris-roubaix/\">Team DSM hinted its riders would use another wireless tyre pressure adjuster</a>, but didn’t on the day.</p>\n<h2>How does KAPS work?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The pump in the hub is controlled wirelessly with a button on the handlebar.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Gravaa</i></span></div>\n<p>The brand says the rotation of the bike’s wheels powers the cylinders of the pump, which is held within the wheel hub.</p>\n<p>To save the pump’s battery, the rider can switch it off when not in use with a pneumatic clutch on the handlebar, according to KAPS.</p>\n<p>The narrow valve connecting the hub to the valve of the bike tyre is said to compress the air flow to enable rapid inflation or deflation.</p>\n<p>The hub pairs to the handlebar remote via Bluetooth or ANT+. Pressing the button up or down raises or lowers pressure. Current pressure can be displayed on a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-computers/\">bike computer</a>, according to KAPS.</p>\n<p>If you simply wish to maintain the same tyre pressure, KAPS says the system can hold a set tyre pressure, even apparently adding air when it detects a puncture.</p>","author":"Jack Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"bb83f9739681c59b16ea12402e51dc13ad58079c0fe53e87a807b09d955203ac","category":"Cycling"}
