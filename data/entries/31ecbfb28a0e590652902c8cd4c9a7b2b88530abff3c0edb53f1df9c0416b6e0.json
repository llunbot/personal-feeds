The process takes a mere 3 minutes, and increases the claimed battery life from 60 hours to 160 hours. I could write a bunch more words, but frankly, it’s as simple as that.</p>\n<p>You’ll update the Favero App first, if you haven’t done so, and then connect to your pedals. The process took about 3 minutes and 20 seconds for me to complete:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_3335.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/IMG_3335.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"235\" height=\"511\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/IMG_3335.png 470w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/IMG_3335-200x435.png 200w\" /><img title=\"IMG_3340.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/IMG_3340.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"235\" height=\"511\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/IMG_3340.png 470w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/IMG_3340-200x435.png 200w\" /><img title=\"IMG_3339.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/IMG_3339.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"235\" height=\"511\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/IMG_3339.png 470w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/IMG_3339-200x435.png 200w\" /></p>\n<p>At the end of which, it’ll ask to do a simple calibration (just leave the crank arm vertical for a few seconds), and you’re done. New battery levels unlocked.</p>\n<p><img title=\"PowerMeter2.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/PowerMeter2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/PowerMeter2-1.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/PowerMeter2-1-200x113.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/PowerMeter2-1-720x405.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/PowerMeter2-1-124x70.jpg 124w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/PowerMeter2-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/PowerMeter2-1-300x169.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Now, I was curious as to whether or not this impacted transmission range/signal strength. So before I did that, I actually measured the signal strength of the Favero pedals in two spots. First, at my handlebars on a mount, and second, directly atop the right pedal itself (which is the pedal that transmits onwards to your bike computer). In this case, signal strength was measured via Bluetooth, as I didn’t have handy my ANT+ signal strength measuring unit.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Before handlebars:</strong> -65dBm<br />\n<strong>After handlebars:</strong> -65dBm</p>\n<p><strong>Before at pedal:</strong> -36dBm<br />\n<strong>After at pedal:</strong> -35dBm</p></blockquote>\n<p>A value of -40 is basically considered very good, and the lower the value (e.g., -65) indicates further away. Either way, all of these values are great, and indicate effectively no meaningful change. And while I haven’t validated the ANT+ signal strength, generally speaking those two are in tandem off the same chipset.</p>\n<p>The reason why signal strength matters in battery tweaking exercises, it can and has absolutely broken some power meters. One only need to remember 4iiii a few years back, trying to dramatically increase their battery claims, only to have endless issues with power meter dropouts on people’s bike computers, because they pushed the limits too far. Signal strength is a big piece of the battery puzzle on these sorts of units, but it’s also a careful balance.</p>\n<p>Of course, it’s not the only piece – the other aspects would be (and obviously is) code changes, designed to optimize performance. This can include cleaning up legacy code, cleaning up inefficient ways of doing things, etc… As is always the case when we see these massive battery jumps, we’ll have to wait to see if there are any unintended consequences across not just one or two people, but the population at large.</p>\n<p>Favero said in a statement that: “This improvement has been made possible through extensive research and development to optimize the algorithm, ensuring extended battery life <u>without compromising the high accuracy and consistency of data that our products are known for</u>.”</p>\n<p>The underlining was included in their quote. Had they really thought it through, for Valentine’s day they’d also have made that text red too. 😂</p>\n<p><img title=\"FaveroMX.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/FaveroMX-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/FaveroMX-1.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/FaveroMX-1-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/FaveroMX-1-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/FaveroMX-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/02/FaveroMX-1-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Historically speaking, Favero is *very* conservative when it comes to making adjustments and rolling out new hardware/software. I’d struggle to think of any company in the field that spends as much time as Favero on the testing side, save perhaps SRAM. Both are known for final validation programs that extend almost as long as some of their competitors’ entire development cycles.</p>\n<p>In any case, go give it a whirl and let me know how it goes in the comments. While Favero already won most people’s money compared to Garmin’s Rally units (based mostly just on price), the battery was one of the last items on the comparison sheet where Favero was ‘losing’ from a technical standpoint (Rally x10 series is at 90 hours). That piece of the puzzle is solved, with the only thing on the comparison sheet left for Favero is to come out with a Look pedal option for their Pro series.</p>\n<p>Either way, I’ve bought a number of <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/06/favero-assioma-pro-rs-spd-sl-power-meter-pedals-review.html\">Favero Pro RS</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/02/favero-assioma-pro-mx-mtb-spd-power-pedal-review.html\">MX series</a> units over the last year to use as power meter comparison pedals for both myself and my wife’s bikes, given the price point is great, and the just-works factor is high.</p>\n<p>With that, thanks for reading!</p><div>\n<h3>Found This Post Useful?
