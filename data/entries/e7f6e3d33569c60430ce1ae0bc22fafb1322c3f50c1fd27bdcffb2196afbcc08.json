It's unclear why the plan was discontinued, but Apple says other Apple Music plans \"already work seamlessly with Siri, and we will continue to optimize this experience.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple added that existing subscribers will receive a notification prior to the end of their final billing cycle with more information.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPriced at $4.99 per month in the U.S., the Voice Plan was designed to let users access Apple Music exclusively through Siri. The plan launched <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/14/ios-15-2-apple-music-voice-plan-video/\">as part of iOS 15.2</a> in December 2021 in the U.S., Australia, Austria, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Taiwan, and the U.K.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe primary way to subscribe to the Voice Plan was by asking Siri, and music playback was controlled via Siri too. While the plan provided access to the entire Apple Music catalog with over 100 million songs, it lacked some features available on more expensive plans, such as downloading, spatial audio, and Family Sharing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>This story was updated with additional information from Apple.</em><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/apple-music-voice-plan-no-longer-available/\">Apple Music's Lower-Priced Voice Plan Being Discontinued</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-musics-lower-priced-voice-plan-being-discontinued.2409543/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e7f6e3d33569c60430ce1ae0bc22fafb1322c3f50c1fd27bdcffb2196afbcc08","category":"Apple"}
