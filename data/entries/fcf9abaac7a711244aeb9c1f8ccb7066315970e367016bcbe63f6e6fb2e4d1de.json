This year, Kona has unveiled an aluminum chassis for those who prefer metal bikes over carbon. The alloy frame features the same geometry as its carbon sibling but is more versatile thanks to a plethora of cargo mounts – we’ve counted eighteen. One of John’s qualms with the carbon Ouroboros was its lacks of touring accouterment and perhaps the alloy version is more designed touring or bikepacking races. </p>\n<p>Needless to say, the mounts and specs are impressive, but so is the cost at just $1,899, adding it to the list of <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2024-touring-bikes-and-rigid-mtbs-under-and-around-2000/\" target=\"_blank\">metal touring</a> and <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2024-affordable-gravel-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">gravel bikes under $2000</a>! The aluminum Ouro features Suntour 40 mm travel gravel fork as well.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/kona-kro-helps-out-local-dealers/\" target=\"_blank\">Kona’s new KRO system</a>, you can buy the new alloy Ouro direct from your local dealer… Roll on over to <a href=\"https://konaworld.com/products/ouroboros\" target=\"_blank\">Kona</a> to see more!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/kona-ouroboros-now-available-in-aluminum/\">Kona Ouroboros Now Available in Aluminum</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"fcf9abaac7a711244aeb9c1f8ccb7066315970e367016bcbe63f6e6fb2e4d1de","category":"Cycling"}
