Netflix says the option will be available on new titles that are coming to Netflix, starting with the final season of YOU that launched today.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe dialogue-only subtitle setting can be selected by opening up the language picker when watching a Netflix show and choosing the \"English\" option. \"English CC\" will have both dialogue and audio cues as normal.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoing forward, dialogue-only subtitles will be available for all new Netflix originals in every language that Netflix offers in addition to the SDH and CC options.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/\">Netflix</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/netflix-debuts-dialogue-only-subtitles/\">Netflix Debuts Dialogue-Only Subtitles</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-debuts-dialogue-only-subtitles.2455913/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ee8a159dfcc467e1e9ba416f45cdf65ffb126d2cb6a29a8ddc3086bc91090adb","category":"Apple"}
