Users must have a <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1564003829\">direct link to the app</a> to be able to find it on the ‌App Store‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/siri-speech-study.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe sparsely designed app simply provides a link to a license agreement and a field to enter a valid participant ID number to begin.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSpeaking to <em>TechCrunch</em>, Apple said that the app is being used to improve ‌Siri‌ across various products by providing a way for participants to share feedback directly with Apple. Apple added that participants have to be invited to the study and there is no way for consumers to volunteer to sign up for the app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhen signed into the ‌Siri‌ Speech Study app, participants must provide explicit feedback on a per request basis, according to Apple. For example, if ‌Siri‌ mishears a request or identifies a user incorrectly, users can explain what they were trying to ask or that they were identified wrongly, which will be fed back to Apple.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNo participant data is automatically shared with Apple and users can see a list of the ‌Siri‌ requests that they have made in the app, and then select which of those to forward to Apple with their feedback. Apple told <em>TechCrunch</em> that no user information is collected or used in the app except for the data directly provided by participants.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/techcrunch/\">TechCrunch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/20/apple-launched-invite-only-siri-speech-study-app/\">Apple Launched Invite-Only 'Siri Speech Study' App to Improve Siri</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launched-invite-only-siri-speech-study-app-to-improve-siri.2308131/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=iJIpElU4lw8:Bd51WEDTo0k:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=iJIpElU4lw8:Bd51WEDTo0k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/iJIpElU4lw8\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7998381a2ad78e84359b8fa20500b7c39961a20b865824252349924265047221","category":"Apple"}
