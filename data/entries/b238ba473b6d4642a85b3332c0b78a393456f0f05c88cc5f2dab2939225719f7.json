Bicycle riders wearing the Hövding airbag ‘helmet’ in the wild. To be honest, I might have seen it in my travels sooner, but the point of the Hövding is that it’s discreet until it’s needed. That is, the airbag was contained in a collar that you wore around your neck – when a pre-crash was detected, the airbag would inflate around the user’s head to protect them. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hovding-3-airbag-e1705596930663.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"535\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hovding-3-airbag-e1705596930663-800x535.jpg\" alt=\"Hovding 3 airbag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hovding-3-airbag-e1705596930663-800x535.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hovding-3-airbag-e1705596930663-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hovding-3-airbag-e1705596930663-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hovding-3-airbag-e1705596930663-768x513.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hovding-3-airbag-e1705596930663-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hovding-3-airbag-e1705596930663.jpg 1986w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, Hövding has been around almost as long as Bikerumor with our first coverage dating back to <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/publicly-crashing-bikes-safely-with-hovding/\" target=\"_blank\">2012/13</a>. Unfortunately for Hövding and their fans, that all seems to have come to an end last month. First reported by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-21/hovding-goes-bankrupt-after-bicycle-airbag-helmet-deemed-unsafe?embedded-checkout=true\">Bloomberg</a>, the Swedish Consumer Agency first imposed a temporary sales freeze on November 1, 2023, due to concerns that the airbag wouldn’t properly inflate. That temporary sales freeze turned into a permanent sales freeze and recall on December 15, 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hövding appealed the decision and won in Administrative Court, which overturned the recall and sales freeze. However, it seems like by that point the damage had been done – at least in the eyes of the board of Hövding Sverige AB. Feeling that the safety reputation of the system was damaged beyond repair,<a href=\"https://www.hovding.com\"> the board decided to file bankruptcy</a> in late December 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hovding-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hovding-3-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Hovding 3\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hovding-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hovding-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hovding-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hovding-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hovding-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hovding-3-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hovding-3.jpg 1920w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As the company works its way through the bankruptcy proceedings, you can continue to use your Hövding though it seems to be at your own risk. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s sad to see an innovator like Hövding fade away, but hopefully, they have laid the groundwork for future innovations in the airbag space – <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/evoc-commute-a-i-r-pro-pack-for-cyclists-rapidly-inflates-in-a-crash/\">like those that we’ve seen from EVOC</a>, and others. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hovding-airbag-helmet-brand-deflates-w-bankruptcy-filing-following-overturned-recall/\">Hövding Airbag ‘Helmet’ Brand Deflates w/ Bankruptcy Following Overturned Recall</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b238ba473b6d4642a85b3332c0b78a393456f0f05c88cc5f2dab2939225719f7","category":"Cycling"}
