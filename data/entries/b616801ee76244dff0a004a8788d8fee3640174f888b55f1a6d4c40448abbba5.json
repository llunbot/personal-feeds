Feedback Sports</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll find the iconic red anodized aluminum Feedback folding bike repair stand in the pits of World Cup cyclocross and mountain bike races, ProTour road paddocks, in the home workshop of amateur bike mechanics, and even being pulled out of the dedicated workspace of independent bike shops as they fix bikes in the parking lot or at public events. The reason you see it everywhere is that it is light, stable, durable, and packs down quickly enough that it can be tossed in the trunk of a car or packed for easy air travel. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_upgrades.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_upgrades-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"Feedback Sports Pro Mechanic lightweight folding aluminum bicycle repair stand, working\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_upgrades-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_upgrades-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_upgrades-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_upgrades-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_upgrades-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_upgrades-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_upgrades.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the flagship Feedback Elite Pro gets rebranded as the Feedback Pro Mechanic, upgrading its jaws, clamp, and hardware for easier use, improved stiffness, and a longer service life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_upgraded-clamp.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_upgraded-clamp-800x444.jpg\" alt=\"Feedback Sports Pro Mechanic lightweight folding aluminum bicycle repair stand, clmap side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_upgraded-clamp-800x444.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_upgraded-clamp-297x165.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_upgraded-clamp-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_upgraded-clamp-768x427.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_upgraded-clamp-1536x853.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_upgraded-clamp.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like we saw with the new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/feedback-pro-mechanic-hd-workstand/\" target=\"_blank\">extra-burly Pro Mechanic HD</a> stand last summer, the new Pro Mechanic repair stand gets upgraded to make modern mechanics’ lives easier and to better deal with heavier bikes – all while staying lightweight for maximum portability. That means a new one-handed metal spinner knob handle at the front to more quickly &amp; more finely clamp your seatpost – with the same proven red Speed Ratchet button. And the bigger rear 3-spoke tri knob to tighten the overall clamp body, and more easily keep the bike from rotating once it is clamped in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_angled-clamp.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_angled-clamp-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"Feedback Sports Pro Mechanic lightweight folding aluminum bicycle repair stand, angled clamp\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_angled-clamp-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_angled-clamp-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_angled-clamp-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_angled-clamp-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_angled-clamp-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Feedback-Sports-Pro-Mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand_lightweight-folding-aluminum-bike-work-stand_angled-clamp.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The clamp jaws themselves also get a new set of tool-free replaceable rubber pads for secure grip on the bike, but easier service once it’s time for new jaws.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hidden inside, the internal clutch now gets 110% more holding power, so you can spin your bike anywhere in the stand’s 360° clamp rotation to access whatever component you need to see &amp;

It packs down the same size as before – 5.125×10.35×45.25″ (13x26x115cm), just as easily as ever.
