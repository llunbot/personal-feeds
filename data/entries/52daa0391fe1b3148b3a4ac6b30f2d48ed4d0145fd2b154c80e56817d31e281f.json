{"title":"Deploying Helm Apps to Kubernetes with Waypoint and GitOps","link":"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/deploying-helm-apps-to-kubernetes-with-waypoint-and-gitops","date":1639587600000,"content":"<p>The <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-hashicorp-waypoint-0-6\">version 0.6 release of HashiCorp Waypoint</a> focused on Kubernetes and added features that support and improve the interaction process around deploying and releasing applications to a cluster. With the new Helm plugin and existing Git integration present in Waypoint, practitioners can use GitOps to automatically deploy Helm applications to their cluster whenever they make a change to their code repository.</p>\n<p>Read on to learn more about these two key features and how to use them to deploy your applications quicker and more easily to Kubernetes with our new <a href=\"https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/waypoint/gitops-helm-deployment\">HashiCorp Learn tutorial</a>.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#helm-deployment-plugin\">»</a><a></a>Helm Deployment Plugin</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.waypointproject.io/plugins/helm\">Helm plugin</a> simplifies the Helm deployment process by abstracting away the individual <code>helm install</code> and <code>helm update</code> commands and integrating them into <code>waypoint up</code> — the one command that takes care of the entire build, deploy, and release process.</p>\n<p>For applications consisting of multiple individual services, this removes the one-to-one requirement between a service and the Helm commands that need to be executed to deploy the service.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#git-integration\">»</a><a></a>Git Integration</h2>\n<p>Waypoint has been able to integrate with Git repositories since <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/using-waypoint-runners-to-enable-gitops-workflows\">version 0.3</a>, which allows you to incorporate Waypoint into GitOps workflows, as shown here:</p><img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1639515803-waypoint-git-integration.png\" /><p>This lowers the barrier to entry for continuous application integration and deployment by simplifying the CI/CD process to a single file: <code>waypoint.hcl</code>. Waypoint polls the repository for changes and automatically executes any build, deploy, and release processes defined in the <code>waypoint.hcl</code> file — no additional scripts needed.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#try-it-out-with-hashicups\">»</a><a></a>Try It Out with HashiCups</h2>\n<p>Since Waypoint can deploy to <a href=\"https://www.waypointproject.io/docs/lifecycle/deploy#target-deployment-platforms\">several different platforms</a>, including Docker, HashiCorp Nomad, and Amazon EC2, you can apply the knowledge from the Git integration to automate your release process in a wide variety of environments.</p>\n<p>Get hands-on with Waypoint, the Helm plugin, and GitOps in the latest <a href=\"https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/waypoint/gitops-helm-deployment\">Waypoint Learn guide: Deploy a Helm-based application automatically with GitOps</a>. By the end of it, you’ll have a working GitOps workflow that deploys the <a href=\"https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-hashicups\">HashiCups example application</a> with Helm (shown below). If you have a Helm-based application ready to go, the steps in the tutorial can easily be adapted to deploy that instead of HashiCups.</p><img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1639515815-hashicups.gif\" />","author":"Anthony Russo","siteTitle":"HashiCorp Blog","siteHash":"219aa6310b3388f2335eba49871f4df9581f2c58eaeb5e498363b54e835b7001","entryHash":"52daa0391fe1b3148b3a4ac6b30f2d48ed4d0145fd2b154c80e56817d31e281f","category":"Tech"}
