This time, we get a look at the innards of the Apple Watch Series 7.</p>\n<p>This Watch model was announced in September—but without a release date. The eventual ship date for the first orders was Friday, October 15.</p>\n<p>iFixit's teardown lends credence to one of the prevailing theories about why there was a delay. The Apple Watch Series 7 appears to use an on-cell touch OLED panel, the same type seen in the iPhone 13 line. Consulting with a former Apple engineer, iFixit suggests that supply challenges related to this display tech are likely the reason the Apple Watch launched a bit late this year and why the device didn't get a release date in last month's keynote announcing it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806823#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806823&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"31d5be9c2099ca9f333f41a7d5abb782ba8b3acd7fc7aa2cd503e90c66fac9dc","category":"Tech"}
