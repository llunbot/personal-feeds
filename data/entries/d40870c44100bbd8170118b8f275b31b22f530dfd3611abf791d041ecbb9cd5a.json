The bold combination of colors and graphic elements in this special edition bike captures the spirit of both brands. While Repete symbolically pulls Rap’s street fashion out of the city, Rap brings the road bike into the city environment. This model is now available in Repete’s running collection. “The base is our handmade Reason frame, which is then fitted with components according to the desires of the customer. The specificity of the collection is a certain openness. Each customer has the freedom to choose and compile a series of diary photos which will be imprinted permanently onto the frame.” — says co-founder Repete Robin Fišer.”</p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Check out the full story and how you can buy one at <a href=\"http://repete.cc/en/magazine_gallery/repete_rap_collection_en\" target=\"_blank\">Repete</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"d40870c44100bbd8170118b8f275b31b22f530dfd3611abf791d041ecbb9cd5a","category":"Cycling"}
