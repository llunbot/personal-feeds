{"title":"CTO Mira Murati Abruptly Leaves OpenAI, Which Is Now Set to Become a For-Profit Company","link":"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-chief-technology-officer-resigns-7a8b4639","date":1727386006000,"content":"\n<p>Deepa Seetharaman, Berber Jin, and Tom Dotan, reporting for The Wall Street Journal (<a href=\"https://apple.news/ACQ-ut0rQQa63ES92rz_xJA\">News+</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>OpenAI is planning to convert from a nonprofit organization to a for-profit company at the same time it is undergoing major personnel shifts including the abrupt resignation Wednesday of its chief technology officer, Mira Murati. Becoming a for-profit would be a seismic shift for OpenAI, which was founded in 2015 to develop AI technology “to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return,” according to a statement it published when it launched.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I guess I wasn’t paying close enough attention, but I wrongly thought this whole debate over turning OpenAI into a for-profit corporation had been decided a year ago, during <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/11/more_altman_openai\">the brief saga</a> when the then-board of directors fired Sam Altman for being profit-driven, and then the board itself dissolved and Altman was brought back.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Things started to change in late 2022 when it released ChatGPT,\nwhich became an instant hit and sparked global interest in the\npotential of generative artificial intelligence to reshape\nbusiness and society. Guided by Chief Executive Sam Altman, OpenAI\nstarted releasing new products for consumers and corporate clients\nand hired a slew of sales, strategy and finance staffers.\nEmployees, including some who had been there from the early days,\nstarted to complain that the company was prioritizing shipping\nproducts over its original mission to build safe AI systems.</p>\n\n<p>Some left for other companies or launched their own, including\n<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/anthropic-makes-play-for-business-customers-8568814e?mod=article_inline\">rival AI startup Anthropic</a>. The exodus has been\nparticularly pronounced this year. Before Murati, OpenAI’s\nco-founder and former chief scientist <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-co-founder-who-helped-oust-sam-altman-leaves-the-company-ed51c6f5?mod=article_inline\">Ilya Sutskever</a>,\nco-founder and former top researcher John Schulman, and former top\nresearcher Jan Leike all resigned since May. Co-founder and former\npresident Greg Brockman recently took a leave of absence through\nthe end of the year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In addition to Murati, chief research officer Bob McGrew and head of post-training Barret Zoph <em>also</em> are leaving OpenAI, according to <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1839093415226524114?s=46\">a post on X from Altman</a>.</p>\n\n<p>OpenAI has high-profile partnerships with both Microsoft and Apple, two companies with decades of extraordinarily stable executive leadership. But OpenAI itself seems to be in a state of constant executive disarray and turmoil. That’s a bit of a head-scratcher to me.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/26/murati-openai\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"006df3c9c038215750710ac71f7c5908cf82db5701f3770f1293f7f657d01034","category":"Tech"}
