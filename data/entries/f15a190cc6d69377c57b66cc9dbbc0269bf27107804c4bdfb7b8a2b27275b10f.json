As a result, the software runs up to five times faster on Apple's new MacBook Pro models, according to the developers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/DaVinci-Resolve-17-3-Edit.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nDaVinci Resolve received an update in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/20/davinci-resolve-new-processing-engine-m1-macs/\">August</a> for Apple's ‌M1‌ chip, found in the low-end 13-inch MacBook Pro, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>. That update brought threefold speed increases to ‌M1‌ machines, thanks to a completely reworked engine, and while the latest version of DaVinci Resolve isn't required to run natively on Apple silicon Macs, it has been optimized to take advantage of the more powerful chips in the new MacBook Pro models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe optimizations rely on hardware acceleration support for Apple's ProRes code, which has been designed specifically for Macs with ‌M1‌ Pro and ‌M1‌ Max processors. Blackmagic says DaVinci Resolve runs up to five times faster on the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro, even when editing 8K video.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>DaVinci Resolve 17.4 Update!
