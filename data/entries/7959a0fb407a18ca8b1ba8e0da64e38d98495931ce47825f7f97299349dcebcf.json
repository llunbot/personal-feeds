Jakobsen’s win comes just one day after Dylan Groenewegen (Jumbo-Visma) took the opening stage of the Tour de Wallonie in what was Groenewegen’s own <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/groenewegen-gets-his-first-win-since-his-suspension/\" target=\"_blank\">first victory since coming back from a suspension</a> that he was given after driving Jakobsen into the barriers on the opening stage of the Tour of Poland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the crash, Jakobsen spent time in a medically-induced coma. The incident also left him with numerous broken bones in his face. Groenewegen was initially disqualified from the Tour of Poland, with the stage 1 victory awarded to Jakobsen, and then the UCI suspended Groenewegen for nine months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jakobsen underwent multiple surgeries in the aftermath of the crash. He returned to racing this April at the Tour of Turkey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think it means the end of my re-validation,” Jakobsen said after his win on Wednesday. “I guess I can say I’m back. I look forward to winning more stages. For today, cheers.”</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Groenewegen yesterday and now Jakobsen today. The two men involved in the harrowing crash at the Tour of Poland are now back winning. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EthiasTourdeWallonie2021?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#EthiasTourdeWallonie2021</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/eWzVtmkRaO\">pic.twitter.com/eWzVtmkRaO</a></p>\n<p>— CyclingTips (@cyclingtips) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cyclingtips/status/1417873460802510848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 21, 2021</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p><p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/jakobsen-takes-his-first-win-since-the-crash-at-last-years-tour-of-poland/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"7959a0fb407a18ca8b1ba8e0da64e38d98495931ce47825f7f97299349dcebcf","category":"Cycling"}
