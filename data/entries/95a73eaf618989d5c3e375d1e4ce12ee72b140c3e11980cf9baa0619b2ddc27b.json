The app allows users to emulate old versions of Windows OS, macOS, Linux, and more to fire up classic software and games on Apple devices. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/utm-se-pc-emulator-ios.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nAs the first of its kind to be allowed on the App Store, UTM SE offers several unique features like VGA mode support for graphics and terminal mode for text-only OSes, emulation of x86, PPC, and RISC-V architectures, support for pre-built machines, and the ability to create custom bootable machines.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple initially rejected the app in June, despite changing its global App Store policy in April regarding <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/app-store-guidelines-emulators-music-app-links/\">retro game emulators</a>. According to the developers, Apple <a href=\"https://x.com/UTMapp/status/1799647652134654045\">said</a> the app violated rule 4.7 of its App Review Guidelines because \"PC is not a console,\" regardless of the fact that there are retro Windows/DOS games for the PC that UTM SE can be useful in running. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also deemed UTM SE unsuitable for third-party marketplaces in the European Union, because it violated rule 2.5.2 of its Notarization Review Guidelines. That rule states that apps have to be self-contained and can't execute code \"which introduces or changes features or functionality of the app, including other apps.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAfter Apple's rejection, UTM's developer said they would not keep going back and forth because the app would become \"a subpar experience.\" However, after help from the AltStore team and <a href=\"https://x.com/UTMapp/status/1812241740172263663\">another developer</a> to work on some changes, UTM SE was finally approved by Apple on Saturday.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs with other emulators, UTM SE requires that users supply the operating systems they want to emulate, but the <a href=\"https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/\">UTM site includes guides</a> for Windows XP through Windows 11 emulation, as well as downloads of pre-built virtual Linux machines. UTM SE can be downloaded from the App Store [<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/utm-se-retro-pc-emulator/id1564628856\">Direct Link</a>].<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/apple-approves-first-retro-pc-emulator-ios/\">Apple Approves First Retro PC Emulator for iPhone, iPad, and Vision Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-approves-first-retro-pc-emulator-for-iphone-ipad-and-vision-pro.2431363/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"95a73eaf618989d5c3e375d1e4ce12ee72b140c3e11980cf9baa0619b2ddc27b","category":"Apple"}
