He told me that he needed a rider like me and that UAE was different to Bahrain.”</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>Novak would ride another two seasons with Bahrain-Victorious, the team with whom he stepped into the WorldTour in 2017, but after finally joining UAE Team Emirates in 2023, he has established himself as Pogačar’s preferred right-hand man. “I am super, super happy that I signed,” Novak, 29, tells </span><i><span>Rouleur</span></i><span>. As Pogačar has steamrolled his way through the season, winning the Giro d’Italia, <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/tour-de-france?srsltid=AfmBOopaaEUBznByyt7BFTcR9b_qDdHaeIzx1pKy1d5mIGwddRm0BNY8\">Tour de France</a>, a couple of Monuments and a host of others races in between, Novak has been the world champion’s teammate on 34 of his 57 race days, five more than João Almeida and Pavel Sivakov, the next most common companions. </span></p>\n<p><span>“In my first year I didn’t race so much with him, but this year we’ve raced more together and we know each other quite well,” Novak says. “A lot of the time he is on my wheel and I don’t need to look because I know he’s there. We’re always thinking the same things, like it’s good to be in the front, and he’s always following me.”</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/ZW-04001.jpg?v=1728896255\" /></div>\n<div><em>Novak with Pogačar during the 2024 World Championships (Image by SWpix.com)</em></div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span><br />Being regarded as a safe pair of hands by the world’s best is a task that only a few can do. What makes Novak fit the bill? “My best quality is that I can die for other guys,” he says. “I can perform much better for others than I can for myself. This is just me.” Honesty is also key. “Sometimes I have to say, ‘fuck, Tadej, I’ve done my maximum today, but I can’t do any more’. When I am with Tadej, I am more motivated. He is the best rider in the world, my good friend, and we enjoy our time together.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Few moments have been as enjoyable as Pogačar’s first stage race of the season, the Volta a Catalunya back in March. “He finished second the first day, and on stage two, no team was pulling [to bring the breakaway back] so me and Tadej attacked,” he narrates. “We had about one minute, no-one followed us, and Tadej said to me, ‘fuck, maybe we wait’. I said: ‘no, let’s take a right on this roundabout, have a piss, wait for the group, hide in the bush, jump in front of the cars and go back into the group’. So that’s what we did and everyone was going full gas to catch us when we were actually behind joking with the sports director. We confused everyone in the peloton.”</span></p>\n<p><span>The prank was synonymous with Pogačar’s approach to racing, an attitude that is reflected in his leadership. “He’s super, super relaxed,” Novak says. “He’s never stressed before a race, he trusts himself that he’s the best, and he just says, ‘yeah, we smash this, no worries guys, let’s go’.” At the recent Canadian double-header, Pogačar noticed how tired his teammates were after the flight from Europe. “We all had a bit of jet lag so in the morning he said, ‘ok, I’m taking you all for coffee’. He made it feel like a holiday race which was super cool. This is how he thinks, always positively.”</span></p>\n<p><span>As well as sharing a mother tongue – “we speak English with the rest of the guys because ours is a strange language that nobody understands,” Novak laughs – the two Slovenians are also coached by Javier Sola, the man credited with introducing gym work to Pogačar’s schedule that the man himself has highlighted as being crucial to his record-breaking season. “I think the gym for me has made a big difference,” Novak says. “The mix of core work and power training in the gym has made me feel stronger on the bike.”</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-2096319238.jpg?v=1728897138\" /></div>\n<p><em><span>Novak and Pogaćar during Volta a Catalunya (Image by Getty Images)</span></em></p>\n<p><span>A winner of every race he’s started this year, with the exception of <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/milan-san-remo-2024-everything-you-need-to-know#:~:text=Milan%2DSanremo%20route%202024%3A&amp;text=The%20majority%20of%20the%20race's,the%20fight%20for%20victory%20begins.\">Milan-Sanremo</a> and GP Québec, Pogačar makes a point of thanking his selfless teammates, many of whom are winners in their own right. “I think Bahrain is a good school for cyclists, but nobody says ‘very good job’ after helping,” Novak says. “With UAE and Tadej, when I help everyone is happy. He is super thankful after the race and is a great leader. When the boss is happy, I’m also happy.”</span></p>\n<p><span>And the boss, three years Novak’s junior, goes out of his way to express his gratitude. “When we’re speaking to the team managers about contracts, Tadej gives good feedback about us to help us.” He also treats them. “He always gives us presents [after a win].” Like what? “It’s a secret,” Novak answers. “They’re personal. I don’t want to share.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Pogačar’s Triple Crown season has been as historic as it has been remarkable, and with the exception of the Tour and the autumnal Italian Classics, Novak has been beside the superstar. “I think the Worlds was the happiest I’ve ever seen him,” Novak says. “I’ve never seen him so happy.” The whole season has been one constant wave of happiness. </span></p>\n<p><span>“I’m super proud to be on this team,” he continues. “When I think about the Giro, Tour and the Worlds, I was there for two of the three parts. I’m just one guy out of all the guys. This is my dream. I know I can never win a Grand Tour, but when I can help and be there, some part of the win is mine. I think I made the right decision joining. This is my dream job, I enjoy it and I am super happy.”</span></p>\n<p><em><span>*Cover image by Getty Images</span></em></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"11d5ed073d90510fd4a3662adc8ea530150632b0d4050e20101fc06d2ade9d44","category":"Cycling"}
