It’s time to get back in the saddle and unpack another weekly hit parade of cycling accessories and tech with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/in-the-drops\" target=\"_blank\">In The Drops</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the pro peloton, the Giro’s middle week has been filled with breakaway exploits and GC energy saving before the mountains roll around. That said, be prepared for the a-Pog-alypse next week as the race reaches its conclusion. For the women, the Vuelta a Burgos Féminas has kicked off in Spain. If that has whetted your appetite, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/vuelta-a-burgos-feminas-preview\" target=\"_blank\">we published our in-depth preview earlier this week</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within the confines of the <em>Cyclist </em>universe this week, James York made the most of the rare English sunshine <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/lincoln-gp-2024-gallery\" target=\"_blank\">at the Lincoln GP last weekend</a>. James Spender dived into the world of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/100-mile-world-record-attempt\" target=\"_blank\">Scottish ultracyclist James MacDonald</a> and Laurence Kilpatrick <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/van-rysel-rcr-shoes-review\" target=\"_blank\">reviewed the most affordable shoes on the WorldTour level</a>. It was like Christmas morning on Wednesday for tech news as <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-red-axs-groupset-review-2024\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM launched its new Red AXS groupset</a>, Zipp shared its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/zipp-vector-r-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">new SL 80 Race</a> handlebars and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hammerhead-karoo-3\" target=\"_blank\">Hammerhead unveiled the new Karoo 3</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over on the Cyclist Magazine Podcast, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/ridelondon-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">James discussed all things RideLondon</a> with race director Kevin Nash. Bear in mind, RideLondon takes place next weekend, with a lineup featuring the FreeCycle, sportives and the women’s pro race on show in the capital. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, enough of that. We have plenty to cover in this week’s In The Drops.

Shockingly omitted from last week’s Met Gala was Cannondale’s first three-figure pricetag helmet, the Dynam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The colours pop out, that’s for sure. The primary hues and monochrome-speckled interiour give a playful feel to the helmet. Maybe playful isn’t the kind of adjective you want associated with a premium adult helmet, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The yellow-accented vents on top may look insignificant, but they are there to maximise ventilation and airflow. Keeping on the practicality front, the helmet comes equipped with the Mips’ integrated Air system. For those not in the helmet know, this provides extra protection against rotational impact in the event of a crash. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Ewan Wilson</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It clocks in at a stated weight of 335g and has a Fidlock buckle to secure the strap together. This is a bit fiddly at first – even if the brand suggests otherwise – but its magnetic closure is a nice novelty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale claims the Dynam’s BioMat fit will suit more head shapes, and I’ve found it comfortable. As long as you have the colour-coordinating kit to match, this helmet can be your statement piece of choice. However, maybe steer clear of pairing up <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tailfin-frame-bag\" target=\"_blank\">Laurence’s Kostüme Kit from last week</a> with this Play-Doh-coloured helmet.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.cannondale.com/en-gb/gear/helmets/adult/dynam-adult-helmets/dynam-adult-helmet\" target=\"_blank\">Cannondale (£150)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Signature jersey</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-canyon-jersey-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-canyon-jersey-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-canyon-jersey-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-canyon-jersey-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-canyon-jersey-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-canyon-jersey-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-canyon-jersey-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-canyon-jersey-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-canyon-jersey-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-canyon-jersey-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-canyon-jersey-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Ewan Wilson</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As Canyon’s leading all-weather road kit, the Signature Pro range is reliable and sleek in design. At first, I was intrigued by the jersey’s shade of ‘Arabic Spice’. What a name, right? I was left wondering whether this was going to be my very own AG2R moment. However, the ‘Arabic Spice’ jersey is earthy and terracotta in appearance, akin to the colour palette of the film Dune.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The jersey is made of a rich streamlined material, ideal for the ‘four seasons in one day’ meteorological experience where I live in Scotland. Thus, it’s not as thin as some more summer-focussed jerseys. In terms of the tailoring, the jersey hugged my body nicely, highlighting my<em> </em>sculpted physique. In the words of my non-cycling housemate, I looked like a superhero. In due course I suspect this will become a go-to for any kind of ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/gear/clothing/jerseys/canyon-men-s-signature-pro-cycling-jersey/9101982.html?dwvar_9101982_pv_farbe=BN\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon (£122)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>SiS Rego Clear Recovery</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8130-970x645.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8130-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8130-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8130-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8130-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8130-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8130-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8130-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8130-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8130-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8130-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Ewan Wilson</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Between the gym bros and the pseudo-nutrition influencers on Instagram, there’s an awful lot of noise in recovery nutrition at the moment. However, Science in Sport’s name and pedigree in cycling nutrition can’t be overlooked. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In its cranberry and raspberry form, the Rego clear recovery drink from Science in Sport has been my post-gym refuel of choice over the past few weeks. SiS states that a 1:1 ratio of protein and carbohydrates is ‘the perfect mix to start the refuelling of muscle glycogen stores, repair and recondition muscle’. With 20g of protein per serving, the Rego Clear Recovery equals most of the competitors in the field. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be fair, it’s quick and hassle-free to make a Rego recovery drink; it’s just an ‘add water and shake’ job. The clear protein is designed with mid-intensity exercise in mind so it’s a fitting compliment for my hour-long gym sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8155-970x645.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8155-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8155-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8155-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8155-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8155-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8155-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8155-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8155-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8155-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC_8155-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Alberto Bettiol sold seperately </figcaption><figcaption>Ewan Wilson</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is only 1.6g of sugar in each serving of the drink. This makes a change from the sugary protein shakes and recovery foods I often lazily reach for. In comparison, it’s ideal if you’re conscious of your daily sugar intake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The instructions on the back of the bag suggest mixing the recovery powder with water. However, I can attest that mixing the Rego Clear Recovery with milk also works a treat. Unorthodox, I know, but it helps make those extra #gains.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.scienceinsport.com/rego-clear-1-38kg-raspberry-cranberry\" target=\"_blank\">Science in Sport (£60)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rapha 20L Roll Top Bag</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-rapha-bagcopy-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-rapha-bagcopy-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-rapha-bagcopy-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-rapha-bagcopy-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-rapha-bagcopy-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-rapha-bagcopy-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-rapha-bagcopy-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-rapha-bagcopy-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-rapha-bagcopy-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-rapha-bagcopy-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-helmet-rapha-bagcopy-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Ewan Wilson</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I am something of a luggagephobe. I am always in fear of using a new bag. Will it fit all my things? Can my laptop comfortably seek refuge? What does 20 litres even look like? Will my prized possessions stay dry in the wet? You learn that last one the hard way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an attempt to rebuild my trust with the luggage community, I have been testing out the 20L Rapha Roll Top Bag. The black exterior shouldn’t fool you, the bag is lined with a visually arresting pink interior. There’s also a high-viz stripe on the back that keeps my worries at bay when riding and walking at night. The waterproof outer layer is a reassuring bonus for keeping my clothes and electronics free from a biblical flooding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside, there is a sleeve pocket to slot laptops and tablets into. For reference, my 14” laptop fits snugly into this dookit. There’s also a zip pocket inside the front pouch to keep your valuables in a VIP space. Handily, the bag comes equipped with clips and elastic slips to keep rattling wires and straps at bay. This does wonders, freeing me from strap-related harassment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, my testing can confirm that the Rapha 20L Roll Top Bag safely fits well within budget airline baggage allowances – at least on Ryanair and EasyJet flights (other airlines are available). I have not been in fear of a cabin crew member hassling me with a pre-loaded card machine for an excess baggage fee of €50 at Glasgow Airport. Long may that be the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p><em><strong>Ad feature</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Accelerate your speed with the new SCOTT Cadence Plus CE helmet</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/1999/02/CADENCE_SCOTT_BIKE_Photo_By_WidenProduction_HighRes1.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/1999/02/CADENCE_SCOTT_BIKE_Photo_By_WidenProduction_HighRes1.png 2000w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/1999/02/CADENCE_SCOTT_BIKE_Photo_By_WidenProduction_HighRes1-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/1999/02/CADENCE_SCOTT_BIKE_Photo_By_WidenProduction_HighRes1-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/1999/02/CADENCE_SCOTT_BIKE_Photo_By_WidenProduction_HighRes1-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/1999/02/CADENCE_SCOTT_BIKE_Photo_By_WidenProduction_HighRes1-1536x1025.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/1999/02/CADENCE_SCOTT_BIKE_Photo_By_WidenProduction_HighRes1-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/1999/02/CADENCE_SCOTT_BIKE_Photo_By_WidenProduction_HighRes1-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/1999/02/CADENCE_SCOTT_BIKE_Photo_By_WidenProduction_HighRes1-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/1999/02/CADENCE_SCOTT_BIKE_Photo_By_WidenProduction_HighRes1-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/1999/02/CADENCE_SCOTT_BIKE_Photo_By_WidenProduction_HighRes1-350x233.png 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Cadence Plus is SCOTT’s fastest racing helmet to date, designed for aerodynamics and high performance.

Throughout the years, I’ve followed the contest intensely. I can vividly remember pulling a tantrum when my older sister deleted the recording of Eurovision 2008 from our family Sky+ box. For context, I was seven years old at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say, I am a fully fledged Eurofan in need of psychological help. This was in part intensified by the chaotic and controversial edition in Malmö last weekend. In a way, this year’s contest was the 1998 Tour de France of the Eurovision world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, through this darkness, I want to shine a particular light on the Irish entry ‘Doomsday Blue’ by Bambie Thug. Ironically, this performance is far from light.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a full house on the Ouija satanic Eurovision bingo card. There were witches, hexes, screaming, pyrotechnics and a lot of fake acrylic nails. Garnished with references to ancient Celtic culture in the form of Ogham scripture, Celtic knots and Triquetra galore, ‘Doomsday Blue’ honoured the avant-garde revival of Celtic art. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a contest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/may/10/eurovision-song-contest-malmo-israel-controversy\" target=\"_blank\">shrouded by controversy</a>, Bambie Thug was one of the few artists to openly and unapologetically speak out in the name of peace and justice. On a platform viewed by hundreds of millions, my faith in the Eurocampness was restored in three minutes. <em>Go raibh míle maith agat</em>, Bambie!</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/ridelondon-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 105: RideLondon Special, with race director Kevin Nash</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-red-axs-groupset-review-2024\">SRAM Red AXS groupset review 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tailfin-frame-bag\">In the Drops: Tailfin’s frame bag, Kostüme’s limited edition eco kit, bold Condor Pro Socks, Apidura’s City backpack and a recycling Wasteland</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/sram-groupsets-buyers-guide\">Complete guide to SRAM road and gravel groupsets</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cannondale-dynam-helmet\">In The Drops: Canyon Signature kit, Cannondale Dynam helmet, SiS Rego Recovery, Rapha Roll Top bag and the Eurovision Song Contest</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"4ff8768213da1169945bc21983c0ab619c347986709a8df347b01867cd1a9790","category":"Cycling"}
