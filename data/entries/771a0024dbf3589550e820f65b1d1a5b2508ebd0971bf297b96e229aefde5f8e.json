You\nmight also have seen us at Motherboard by Vice, The Verge and The\nWashington Post’s games vertical Launcher. We got back together to\nstart this site not just so we could all blog together again, but\nto try something new for ourselves and for games journalism.</p>\n\n<p>These days it’s tough for journalism, especially about games. The\npast few years have seen mass layoffs and site closures, with\nremaining writers being asked to do more and more with less and\nless. The ad-supported model is crumbling, social media is a mess,\nand the businessmen and private equity firms buying up news\noutlets don’t care about workers, readers, and quality writing,\nthey only care about profits. The five of us saw our sites closed,\nourselves and our colleagues laid off, and our workplaces turned\nhostile in management’s pursuit of growth at all costs. [...]</p>\n\n<p>As workers and owners, we’re beholden to no one but ourselves, and\nto you, our readers. When you <a href=\"https://aftermath.site/products\">subscribe</a>, you’ll get access to\nwriting that pursues the truth and casts a critical eye on gaming\nand the internet, that doesn’t need to placate capital or kowtow\nto PR. You’ll be supporting the kind of journalism our past\nexperience has shown us you like best: honest and irreverent,\nwritten for people rather than SEO. You’ll get a site that\nprioritizes the reader experience, with no invasive popups or ads\nthat burn up your device.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They’re a smart crew, so of course, they’re <em>not</em> launching this on Substack. (They’re using a platform called <a href=\"https://joinlede.com/\">Lede</a>, upon which the excellent <a href=\"https://defector.com/\">Defector</a> has built itself.) How can you not love a site with this ode to a classic bit of kit: “<a href=\"https://aftermath.site/bob-barker-mic-gameshow-sony-ecm-51-match-game\">Bring Back Those Long-Ass Game Show Mics</a>”. An elegant weapon, from a more civilized age.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/07/aftermath\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"771a0024dbf3589550e820f65b1d1a5b2508ebd0971bf297b96e229aefde5f8e","category":"Tech"}
