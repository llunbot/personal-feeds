We have <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/review-frameworks-next-gen-laptop-follows-through-on-its-upgradeable-promises/\">reviewed</a> this <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/review-framework-laptops-13th-gen-intel-upgrade-helps-fix-its-battery-problem/\">laptop</a> five <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/framework-laptop-13-reviewed-again-meteor-lake-meh-linux-upgrades-good/\">other times</a>, and in that time, the idea of a repairable and upgradeable laptop has gone from a \"sounds great if they can pull it off\" idea to one that's become pretty reliable and predictable. And nearly four years out from the original version—which shipped with an <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/frameworks-new-lightweight-modular-laptop-delivers-on-its-promises/\">11th-generation Intel Core processor</a>—we're at the point where an upgrade will get you significant boosts to CPU and GPU performance, plus some other things.</p>\n<p>We're looking at <a href=\"https://frame.work/products/laptop13-diy-amd-ai300/configuration/new\">the Ryzen AI 300 version</a> of the Framework Laptop today, currently available for preorder and shipping in Q2 for people who buy one now. The laptop starts at $1,099 for a pre-built version and $899 for a RAM-less, SSD-less, Windows-less DIY version, and we've tested the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 version that starts at $1,659 before you add RAM, an SSD, or an OS.</p>\n<p>This board is a direct upgrade to Framework's Ryzen 7040-series board from mid-2023, with most of the same performance benefits we saw last year <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/ryzen-ai-300-performance-review-impressive-cpus-even-if-you-dont-care-about-ai/\">when we first took a look at the Ryzen AI 300 series</a>. It's also, if this matters to you, the first Framework Laptop to meet Microsoft's requirements for its Copilot+ PC initiative, giving users access to some extra locally processed AI features (including but not limited to Recall) with the promise of more to come.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/review-ryzen-ai-cpu-makes-this-the-fastest-the-framework-laptop-13-has-ever-been/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/review-ryzen-ai-cpu-makes-this-the-fastest-the-framework-laptop-13-has-ever-been/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c4e455e2ed314bfffb1b8bbc0490fc73a920e98e1a4ae03138fcf8b28fd5bcf4","category":"Tech"}
