The package is said to be in a small trial production phase, with the intention of mass producing the chips in 2025 and 2026 for new Macs and AI cloud servers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nReferences to what are believed to be Apple's M5 chip have already been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/a19-and-m5-chips-discovered/\">discovered</a> in official Apple code. Apple has been working on processors for its own AI servers made with TSMC's 3nm process, targeting <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-developing-its-own-ai-server-processor/\">mass production by the second half of 2025</a>. However, according to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-building-m2-ultra-and-m4-servers/\">Haitong analyst Jeff Pu</a>, Apple's plans in late 2025 are to assemble AI servers powered by its M4 chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCurrently, Apple's AI cloud servers are believed to be running on multiple connected M2 Ultra chips, which were originally designed solely for desktop Macs. Whenever the M5 is adopted, its advanced dual-use design is believed to be a sign of Apple future-proofing its plan to vertically integrate its supply chain for AI functionality across computers, cloud servers, and software.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Via <a href=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240703PD213/apple-cloud-ai-chips-cloud-computing-market.html\">Digitimes.com</a>.)</em><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/\">TSMC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m5/\">M5</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/04/apple-m5-chips-advanced-packaging-tsmc/\">Apple M5 Chip's Dual-Use Design Will Power Future Macs and AI Servers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-m5-chips-dual-use-design-will-power-future-macs-and-ai-servers.2430670/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d8248782cb72860468f4320647b5f548502db0cb8638e5263e8b93795fd0cc26","category":"Apple"}
