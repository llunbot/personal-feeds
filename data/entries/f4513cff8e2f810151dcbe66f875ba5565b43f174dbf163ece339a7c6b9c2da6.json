We’ve heard about the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2795595/ios-19-will-reportedly-include-a-dedicated-gaming-app.html\">new gaming app,</a> a major <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2791509/apple-job-posting-confirms-calendar-revamp.html\">Calendar revamp</a>, and an <a href=\"https://youtu.be/HaP_q9W3AQE?si=AIDeAZ5ezNTt31RN\">updated Camera app,</a> among other new items. A new <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/03/exclusive-ios-26-messages-carplay-more/\">report</a> from 9to5Mac provides a peek at a few more things we could see in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2575705/ios-19-features-release-date-beta.html\">iOS 26</a>. These new features include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Messages</strong>: The ability to automatically translate messages and to conduct polls. Both of these features are based on Apple Intelligence.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Music</strong>: The iPhone lock screen will be able to display full-screen animated album artwork.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Notes</strong>: Users will be able to use <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\">Markdown</a> syntax to format their Notes entries.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CarPlay</strong>: The interface will also get a redesign to match that of iOS 26.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>9to5Mac specifically states that these features are coming to iOS 26. It is not clear if they will make their way to iPadOS 26 or <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2644146/macos-16-release-beta-features-compatibility.html\">macOS 26</a>. Sometimes Apple releases features like this in iOS first, with other OSes getting them at a later date, but the latest rumors suggest that most design changes will be made across all OSes, so it makes sense that many features will also be universal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll find out what new features are coming during the WWDC25 keynote on Monday at 10 a.m. Pacific. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">Learn all about WWDC25</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2575705/ios-19-features-release-date-beta.html\">get more information about the upcoming iOS 26</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f4513cff8e2f810151dcbe66f875ba5565b43f174dbf163ece339a7c6b9c2da6","category":"Apple"}
