There’s 150mm at the fork and it still rolls on 29in wheels front and rear, but now has a 625Wh battery pack.</p>\n<p>The Yamaha-made SyncDrive Pro Motor for the 2022 bike has been made lighter and more compact, while getting more torque, and is claimed to make less noise.</p>\n<p>Prices start at £5,999 / $6,800 for the Trance X E+ 2 Advanced and rise to £7,999 / $9,300 / AU$12,799 for the range-topping Trance X Advanced E+ 0.</p>\n<h2>2022 Giant Trance X Advanced E+ frame and suspension details</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The brand’s Maestro suspension is critically acclaimed.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant Bicycles</i></span></div>\n<p>Giant says its latest Trance X Advanced E+ has been built from a high-performance grade raw carbon material with an impressive stiffness-to-weight ratio.</p>\n<p>To achieve the desired performance balance, the front triangle is said to be layered up and moulded as one single section of carbon in a process called Modified Monocoque Construction. The rear end is also made from carbon fibre, as is the Maestro suspension upper-rocker link.</p>\n<p>The Maestro suspension – as used on most of Giant’s full-suspension bikes, and the Trance X Advanced E+ – has 140mm of travel. It has two co-rotating links to give virtual pivot placement that creates “the most active, efficient and independent suspension system on the trail,” according to Giant.</p>\n<ul><li>Further reading: <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">The ultimate guide to mountain bike rear-suspension systems</a></li>\n</ul><p>The suspension system is similar in theory and practice to other twin-link systems on the market, including <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/interview-dave-weagle-suspension-designer/\">Dave Weagle</a>’s DW-Link, Santa Cruz’s VPP and Intense’s JS Tuned system. Pivot placement enables the brand to tune attributes such as anti-squat, progression, leverage rate and anti-rise.</p>\n<p>In the case of the new Trance X Advanced E+, Giant doesn’t divulge any details on the system’s specific kinematics, however.</p>\n<h2>2022 Giant Trance X Advanced E+ motor, control and battery details</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new Trance X Advanced E+’s Yamaha SyncDrive motor is claimed to be lighter than the outgoing model.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant Bicycles</i></span></div>\n<p>At the heart of the new bike is Yamaha’s SyncDrive Pro motor that now delivers up to 85Nm of torque – an increase from 80Nm – and weighs 2.7kg, lighter than the outgoing version. Visibly, the motor is more compact than the older version, and Giant claims it has reduced noise levels.</p>\n<p>The motor is paired with a 625Wh battery pack, but it’s also compatible with Giant’s EnergyPak Plus, a 250Wh range-extender external battery.</p>\n<p>The bike is coupled with a new handlebar remote that has three buttons, called RideControl Ergo 3, that can be mounted on either the left- or right-hand side of the bars, and can be paired with a second remote with user-programmable controls in the RideControl smartphone app.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Giant’s latest RideControl system includes a new bar remote and top-tube controller.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant Bicycles</i></span></div>\n<p>The app connects to the bike wirelessly and permits the connected smartphone to function as a live ride data display, and can perform system updates.</p>\n<p>The main on/off button – called RideControl Go – is integrated into the bike’s top tube and can also be used to change the assistance levels.</p>\n<h2>2022 Giant Trance X Advanced E+ geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The geometry has been given a longer, lower, slacker treatment.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant Bicycles</i></span></div>\n<p>The 2022 Giant Trance X Advanced E+ geometry has been given a welcome longer, lower and slacker makeover.</p>\n<p>Its geometry is also adjustable between a high and low position, thanks to a flip chip located in the lower shock mount.

Why, exactly, further steps need to be taken isn’t quite clear.</p>\n<p>That said, Fox’s Live Valve works well, as technical editor-in-chief Rob Weaver found out on the standard-powered <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/giant-trance-x-advanced-pro-29-0-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Giant Trance X Advanced Pro 29 0,</a> so it shouldn’t hinder performance, even if the enhancements are marginal.</p>\n<h3>What alternatives are there to the 2022 Giant Trance X Advanced E+ electric mountain bike?</h3>\n<p>With 140mm of rear-wheel travel, the Trance X Advanced E+ is at the lower end of the ebike travel spectrum.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> S-Works models are Specialized’s top-of-the-line versions of their bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The closest we’ve recently tested is the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/specialized-s-works-turbo-levo-review/\">2022 Specialized Turbo Levo</a>, with 150mm of squish, but it’s fitted with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/fox-38-factory-grip2-fork-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Fox 38</a>, instead of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/2021-fox-36-factory-grip2-fork-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Fox 36</a> on the Trance.</p>\n<p>Geometry figures also don’t match up perfectly, and arguably – despite the Turbo Levo being described as a trail bike – it packs a heftier punch than the Trance X E+. <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/canyon-spectral-on-cf-7-0-review/\">Canyon’s Spectral:ON CF</a> is close on geometry figures and travel, but has slightly more squish at 150mm.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Canyon Spectral:ON CF is a good performer.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Don’t get hung up on travel figures though – the Trance X E+ looks as though it should be up there with the best of the current crop of trail electric mountain bikes.</p>\n<h3>Giant Trance X Advanced E+ 0</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 2022 Giant Trance X Advanced E+ 0.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant Bicycles</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Frame:</strong> Advanced-grade composite frame, 140mm Maestro suspension</li>\n<li><strong>Fork:</strong> Fox 36 Factory Live Valve, 150mm travel</li>\n<li><strong>Shock:</strong> Fox Float X Factory Live Valve</li>\n<li><strong>Motor:</strong> Yamaha SyncDrive Pro, 85Nm</li>\n<li><strong>Battery:</strong> EnergyPak Smart 625Wh</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> Shimano XT M8100 12-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Finishing kit:</strong> Giant Contact SL</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels/tyres:</strong> Giant e-TRX/Maxxis Assegai EXO 3C MaxxTerra 29×2.6in (f), Maxxis Dissector EXO+ 3C 29×2.6in (r)</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £7,999 / $9,300 / AU$12,799</li>\n</ul><h3>Giant Trance X Advanced E+ 1</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 2022 Giant Trance X Advanced E+ 1.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant Bicycles</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Frame:</strong> Advanced-grade composite frame, 140mm Maestro suspension</li>\n<li><strong>Fork:</strong> Fox 36 Factory Live Valve, 150mm travel</li>\n<li><strong>Shock:</strong> Fox Float X Live Valve</li>\n<li><strong>Motor:</strong> Yamaha SyncDrive Pro, 85Nm</li>\n<li><strong>Battery:</strong> EnergyPak Smart 625Wh</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> Shimano XT M8100 12-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Finishing kit:</strong> Giant Contact</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels/tyres:</strong> Giant AM/Maxxis Assegai EXO 3C MaxxTerra 29×2.6in (f), Maxxis Dissector EXO+ 3C 29×2.6in (r)</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £6,999 / AU$10,799</li>\n</ul><h3>Giant Trance X Advanced E+ 2</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 2022 Giant Trance X Advanced E+ 2.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant Bicycles</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Frame:</strong> Advanced-grade composite frame, 140mm Maestro suspension</li>\n<li><strong>Fork:</strong> Fox 36 Performance, 150mm travel</li>\n<li><strong>Shock:</strong> Fox DPS Performance</li>\n<li><strong>Motor:</strong> Yamaha SyncDrive Pro, 85Nm</li>\n<li><strong>Battery:</strong> EnergyPak Smart 625Wh</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> Shimano XT M8100 12-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Finishing kit:</strong> Giant Contact</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels/tyres:</strong> Giant AM/Maxxis Assegai EXO 3C MaxxTerra 29×2.6in (f), Maxxis Dissector EXO+ 3C 29×2.6in (r)</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £5,999 / $6,800</li>\n</ul>","author":"Alex Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"6525d01bab853a72c1f40fb0941f058f6d9e766b73b297c1b7ded6fe3168c0cf","category":"Cycling"}
