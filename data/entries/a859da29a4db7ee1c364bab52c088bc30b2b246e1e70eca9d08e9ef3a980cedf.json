Electronic Arts <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/legacy-sunset\">announced Tuesday</a> that it would remove the older titles from all online storefronts on April 28.</p>\n<p>EA says the move comes as the company \"shift[s] our focus towards our current and future <em>Battlefield</em> experiences.\" The announcement also cites \"preparation for the retirement of the online services for these titles,\" currently set for December 8.</p>\n<p>But the server shutdown argument doesn't fully explain the delisting of the <em>Battlefield: Bad Company</em> games, which both include single-player campaigns that don't require any server resources on EA's part.
