This makes it ideal for the most demanding workflows like manipulating fantastic panoramas you took during your latest trip or compiling millions of lines of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things we must praise about the laptop is its screen. The 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display is simply stunning, delivering vivid colors and deep contrast. It also helps that it has over 1000 nits of brightness, which means you can use it even in super bright areas, including outdoors. Battery life won’t hold you back either because you get about 28 hours of uninterrupted use. As long as you remember to plug it in to charge while you’re getting ready in the morning or when you get home in the evening, you should be good to go to leave the house without the charger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2211441/14-inch-m3-pro-macbook-pro-review.html\">reviewed the M3 Pro</a> <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2211441/14-inch-m3-pro-macbook-pro-review.html\">MacBook Pro</a>, we gave it a 4.5/5 star rating and our Editors’ Choice award, appreciating the great performance and how quiet it is even under heavy loads. We noted that “you’ll be glad you paid the difference” over the base model at full price, so this deal makes it a no-brainer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At just <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM5JV26D?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$1,699, the Apple M3 Pro MacBook Pro</a> is a stellar investment for anyone looking to go through the day without worrying about their laptop’s performance in any way.</p>\n\n\n<span>The Apple MacBook Pro M3 Pro is $300 off right now</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM5JV26D?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Get it at Amazon</a></div>\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"71e01be2ab360ac0c5c2cce240d071be4c2bf705b31810ac6dcd421bd29fe986","category":"Apple"}
