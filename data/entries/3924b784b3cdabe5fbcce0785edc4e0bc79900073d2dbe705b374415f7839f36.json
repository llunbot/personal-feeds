Selecting just five riders for the inaugural team was extremely tough and OMM wants to thank everyone that applied. Let’s check out the picks for the 2025 team below…</em><span></span></p>\n<p>Today, <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/old-man-mountain/\" target=\"_blank\">Old Man Mountain</a> announced that it has chosen its team and while the goal for this experiment is not about chasing podiums, the brand is definitely not going to be afraid of them.</p>\n<p>Bikepacking races celebrate solo efforts, independence, and solitude—but we also want to see what happens when we prepare and grow together, strengthening our ability to go it alone when the grand depart arrives. This Experimental Bikepacking Team represents the heart of camaraderie and adventure, engaging in races, supporting fellow riders, and celebrating the journey. We want to push what we can do on a bike and through our collaborative spirit beyond the podium.</p>\n<p>Throughout this year OMM will be sharing what the team is up to, and what it is learning from each other. Without further delay, here is the 2025 Experimental Bikepacking Team!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Shelesky_IMG7020.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Shelesky_IMG7020.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Shelesky_IMG7020.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Shelesky_IMG7020.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Shelesky_IMG_8622.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Shelesky_IMG_8622.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Shelesky_IMG_8622.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Shelesky_IMG_8622.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><b>Hannah Simon</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/silk-road-mountain-race-is-hard/\" target=\"_blank\">Hannah</a> is a queer, femme, ultra-endurance cyclist who began her long distance riding in 2018. She completed the Texas 4000 that year, a short, little jaunt from Austin, TX to Anchorage, AK. After that experience, she fell absolutely in love with traveling absurd distances by bike. The obsession lured her to working with bikes, first as a mechanic and then General Manager at Cycleeast in Austin TX.</p>\n<p>She’s now a part time production assistant, making bike frames, at Chumba USA. She’s also a part time barista slinging espresso to satiate another of her obsessions: coffee.</p>\n<p>Hannah’s ultra race endeavors started in 2021 with East Texas Showdown. Since then, she has competed in some of the largest bikepacking races in the world. In 2023, she completed the Triple Crown of bikepacking: Tour Divide, Colorado Trail, and Arizona Trail. Her 2024 season included a 3rd place finish at Atlas Mountain Race, in Morocco and 1st place at Silk Road Mountain race in Kyrgyzstan.</p>\n<p>Most of her cycling is long distance racing in remote areas, though when she is back home it is one of her most social activities. Bikes have brought many of her favorite people into her life and taken her to places she never imagined she’d go.</p>\n<p><b>“What’s your favorite trail snack when you’re in too deep &amp; need a pick-me-up?”</b></p>\n<p>Nothing hits quite like Tater Boost!!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-ARHC-2024.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-ARHC-2024.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-ARHC-2024.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-ARHC-2024.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-Aussie-Tour-2024.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-Aussie-Tour-2024.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-Aussie-Tour-2024.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-Aussie-Tour-2024.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><b>Eric House (housie)</b></p>\n<p>Eric House (housie), is an ultra endurance athlete with an unwavering excitement for exploration.</p>\n<p>His hobby turned into a passion in 2021, following a snowboarding accident in November 2020 that left him with a broken clavicle and a mound of self-doubt. In an effort to rehabilitate and remove any fear of becoming sedentary, Eric committed to his first race: a triathlon (don’t judge too much). This is when he traded a vintage Peugeot for a steel gravel bike from his LBS, Race Ready Repair.</p>\n<p>In addition to getting my body moving again, the bike world introduced him to a broader community of folks that have enriched life beyond what he could have imagined. He began working as a ride leader and vibe creator with The Gravel Collective, a non-profit bike group with the goal of inclusion and generating passion through bikes. These group rides showed the strength and value in community building.</p>\n<p>His first ultra in east Texas solidified his love for long distance, unsupported bikepack racing and reinvigorated his love for exploration via bike. In 2022 he began racing short track XC through the Texas Mountain Bike Racing Association in addition to racing ultras. Though he loved long distance riding, XC is where he developed excitement for competition. There were a number of successes and failures during the year that helped boost skills and confidence, while keeping him humble and focused.The true bike “glow up” happened in 2023 when he turned to single speed. This is when passion turned into purpose. The shift to single speed provided the simple, raw body-bike connection, and that childlike joy from his BMX days growing up.</p>\n<p>2024 has been a year of movement. Housie raced, toured, and gained a greater appreciation for the wonders and fulfillment the bike can bring. “Bikes have always felt like a tool of exploration, and now, as an adult I get the privilege to ride… just about anywhere!”</p>\n<p><b>“What’s your favorite trail snack when you’re in too deep &amp; need a pick-me-up?”</b></p>\n<p>Nerd clusters &amp; peanut butter when I need a quick pick me up.

Her journey into the world of bikepacking began in 2019, after completing her master’s degree in Environmental Management she took a leap into the unknown. A complete rookie, Paola embarked on a 10-month, life-changing adventure, bike-touring through over 15 countries—from Portugal to Armenia—with a detour to Morocco during Ramadan. That trip opened her eyes to the transformative power of exploration and self-discovery through cycling, sparking a love for adventure that continues to shape Paola’s life.</p>\n<p>She’s since dedicated herself to mapping routes, offering guidance, and sharing her experiences. Hoping to inspire others to explore Mexico’s rich geography and beyond. Paola documents the beauty of her travels through landscape photography, seeking to capture moments that reflect the unique essence of the places.</p>\n<p>2024 marked her ultra-race debut, an achievement that came after a challenging recovery from a torn ACL and the loss of her father; her biggest fan and greatest supporter. “His memory inspires me to embrace life, push my limits, and honor the joy of exploration,” said Paola.</p>\n<p>She co-founded Morrxs Todo Terreno, one of the first inclusive spaces in Mexico for women, non-binary, and trans cyclists. Through workshops and hosted rides, they connect with the community to empower them to ride off-road confidently and build self-sufficiency. They aim to foster a sense of autonomy and freedom while embracing the joy cycling brings.</p>\n<p>In 2025, she plans to focus on completing the Japanese Odyssey, aiming to be one of the few women to finish this challenging endurance race. She also wants to take on <i>Le Tour de Frankie: El Infierno del Sur</i> from CDMX to Puerto Escondido Beach, improve her time from my previous attempt, and participate in the L.A. Tourist Race in California. Additionally, she’ll continue exploring and mapping new off-road routes across Mexico. Alongside these goals, she’ll remain committed to community organizing, working to bring the bike community together and strengthen connections within it.</p>\n<p><b>“What’s your favorite trail snack when you’re in too deep &amp; need a pick-me-up?”</b></p>\n<p>Banana bread and dates.

It’s quiet and cold right now, yet, an opportunity for ample adventures from her door. You can find her hanging out with her (mostly) good fuzzy boy Wyatt 🐶, and riding her heart out when she can! Her day-to-day work life is filled with working alongside a group of talented scientists doing benchtop lab work. She is also a Type 1 Diabetic which she feels important to mention to showcase what’s possible with diabetes.</p>\n<p>This past year she has built up a host of “filthy Friday” community rides that are aimed at being quite adventurous, hard, but supportive. Stephanie loves nerding out on maps, and studying routes for way longer than necessary.</p>\n<p>”Looking into 2025, it’s shaping up to be my most adventurous year yet, with fat bike overnights planned and Hellenic Mountain Race on the horizon. I’m motivated by big, intimidating goals, and humbled by the journey often!</p>\n<p>I’d love to add a pairs race with my twin sister, Kayla Hall, comment if you’ve got a race we should do!”</p>\n<p><b>“What’s your favorite trail snack when you’re in too deep &amp; need a pick-me-up?”</b></p>\n<p>Ooof!

He made it and promptly bought himself a real bike (sorry housie!). He was addicted.</p>\n<p>Prioritizing time spent outside, bikepacking was the ticket to maximizing that time.</p>\n<p>The following handful of years were spent jumping into every kind of bike racing imaginable. Road, cyclocross, xc short track, 24 hour, gravel, alleycats, you name it…he tried it.</p>\n<p>In March of 2022, Mateo entered his first ultra endurance mountain bike event and it brought him back to that touring mindset that he’d forgotten about and pointed him to where he is now; racing across continents, through mountains in Morocco, over the lost bohemian borderlands of Poland and Czechia and the fjords of Iceland and Norway.</p>\n<p>With 14 self supported bikepacking races finished, and yet some of the most challenging still on the upcoming calendar, Mateo has confidence heading into 2025.</p>\n<p>Upcoming endeavors include the Trans Ecuador Mountain Bike Route in January and a 2nd crack at the legendary Tour Divide race in June.</p>\n<p>“Onward!”</p>\n<p><b>“What’s your favorite trail snack when you’re in too deep &amp; need a pick-me-up?”</b></p>\n<p>If I’m down and out, anything hot will bring me back to life, preferably a good old American diner breakfast!
