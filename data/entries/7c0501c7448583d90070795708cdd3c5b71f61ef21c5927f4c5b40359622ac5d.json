But in years, it represents a long time to keep doing something again and again: like the 24 Hours of Le Mans, an annual race around an 8-mile circuit in France that exists not just as a way to entertain but also to improve the cars we drive on the road. Windshield wipers, disc brakes, fuel injection, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2014/06/laserbeam-headlights-not-in-the-us/\">laserbeam headlights</a> are just a few examples that were proved in the cauldron of the 24 Hours before appearing on cars like the one you might drive.</p>\n<p>This weekend saw the centenary edition of the race take place.

Across 91 actual races—world wars prevented running some years—Porsche's entries notched 19 wins, more than anyone else. Audi has the next-best record, but it has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/08/audi-will-build-f1-engines-entering-the-sport-in-2026/\">opted to spend its racing budget on Formula 1 for the foreseeable future</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947065#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947065&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
