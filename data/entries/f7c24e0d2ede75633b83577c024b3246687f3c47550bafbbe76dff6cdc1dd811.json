The company’s senior vice president \nof grocery stores says they’re moving away from Just Walk Out, \nwhich relied on cameras and sensors to track what people were \nleaving the store with. </p>\n\n<p>Just over half of Amazon Fresh stores are equipped with Just Walk \nOut. The technology allows customers to skip checkout altogether \nby scanning a QR code when they enter the store. Though it seemed \ncompletely automated, Just Walk Out relied on more than <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-amazons-big-bet-on-just-walk-out-stumbled?rc=5xvgzc\">1,000 \npeople in India watching and labeling videos</a> to ensure \naccurate checkouts. The cashiers were simply moved off-site, and \nthey watched you as you shopped. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It was The Information, too, that broke the story about how labor-intensive “Just Walk Out” was, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-amazons-big-bet-on-just-walk-out-stumbled\">reporting last May</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For its part, Amazon still relies on a significant amount of human \nstaffing to power Just Walk Out behind the scenes, according to a \nperson who has worked on the technology. Amazon had more than \n1,000 people in India working on Just Walk Out as of mid-2022 \nwhose jobs included manually reviewing transactions and labeling \nimages from videos to train Just Walk Out’s machine learning \nmodel, the person said. The reliance on backup humans explains in \npart why it can take hours for customers to receive receipts after \nwalking out of a store, the person said. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Molly White, back in January, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1751670561606971895\">regarding the purported AI-generated George Carlin comedy special</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Need to start keeping a list of all the times some big supposed \ndisplay of bleeding edge technology turns out to just be A Guy. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/02/amazon-just-walk-out\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f7c24e0d2ede75633b83577c024b3246687f3c47550bafbbe76dff6cdc1dd811","category":"Tech"}
