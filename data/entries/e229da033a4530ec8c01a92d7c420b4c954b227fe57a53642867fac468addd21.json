Normally, updates of this magnitude would only arrive in one of Windows' big yearly feature updates, but the company said last week that all of these changes would be added to the current revision of Windows 11, version 22H2.</p>\n\n<p>In a blog post <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=178424\">released today</a>, Microsoft said that Windows <em>is</em> getting its yearly update later this year but that the Windows 11 2023 Update won't include new features or fixes. Instead, it's what Microsoft calls an \"enablement package,\" which will essentially will bump up the version number without making any other changes to the underlying code or turning on new features.</p>\n<p>Microsoft says that this 23H2 update \"will be cumulative with all the newly announced features,\" so any new install media created with Windows 23H2 will include Copilot and all the other updates that Microsoft is rolling out today. It's just that the new features and the new version number are technically arriving separately instead of being grouped together as they would have been in past years. Microsoft says people running Windows 11 22H2 can get most of the new features by manually installing the optional October update that's available in Windows Update today or by enabling the \"get the latest updates as soon as they’re available\" toggle in Windows Update. The non-optional November update will enable all these features on all Windows 11 PCs.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970674#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970674&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e229da033a4530ec8c01a92d7c420b4c954b227fe57a53642867fac468addd21","category":"Tech"}
