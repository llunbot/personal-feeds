The RTX 5080 is $999, the same price as the RTX 4080 Super; the 5070 Ti and 5070 are launching for $749 and $549, each $50 less than the 4070 Ti Super and 4070 Super.</p>\n<p>The bad news for people looking for the absolute fastest card they can get is that the company is charging $1,999 for its flagship RTX 5090 GPU, significantly more than the $1,599 MSRP of the RTX 4090. If you want Nvidia's biggest and best, it will cost at least as much as four high-end game consoles or a pair of decently specced midrange gaming PCs.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/geforce-rtx-50-gpus-run-from-1999-to-549-lean-heavily-on-ai-generated-frames/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/geforce-rtx-50-gpus-run-from-1999-to-549-lean-heavily-on-ai-generated-frames/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9711466f3d7424cc3997d4ba4d4f40b1a435cc3bafdf1037854a9e31b3f0cdd6","category":"Tech"}
