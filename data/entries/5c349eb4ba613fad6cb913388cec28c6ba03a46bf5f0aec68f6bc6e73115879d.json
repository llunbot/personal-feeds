And even still, the desire to seek out new places draws me in. Once in a while, I have that feeling of having ridden all the possible trails and tracks from my backdoor, leaving me wondering what route to take next as a ride out from home.</p>\n<p>When route-making, we’re naturally drawn to bounded lines as the obvious way to shape a ride. And no boundary is more defined in presence and power than that of a river, for the need of a bridge or shallow water to cross.</p>\n<p>This began me asking this question about the river that passes through my neighbourhood. Where does it begin and how does it get here? This started me on a journey; rather than ride further and faster, or to climb higher, I was going to go deeper, guided by the river.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Watershed-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Watershed-3.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Watershed-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Watershed-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>As I researched the river’s course, I began to trace a route to its source. Instead of following the river’s course as close as I could, its watershed became the guide for my route, the invisible divide where rainfall drains into the river’s meandering path.</p>\n<p>A two-day cycling pilgrimage to gain a perspective on the lie of the land. Not least to act as a reminder of the endless cycle of water, how it shapes the land and defines trail conditions through the seasons.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Watershed-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Watershed-5.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Watershed-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Watershed-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The river’s path marks the long-contested border of Wales and England. In these edgelands and with this in mind, I set out on my ride alive to the imaginary and material boundaries.</p>\n<p>A chance to recalibrate my compass and see my local environment with fresh eyes. There’s always something to be learnt when we look closer.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Watershed-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Watershed-4.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Watershed-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Watershed-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Wherever we find ourselves, the invitation is always there to recognise the signs and patterns in the rest of nature, to transcend the boundaries that shift, evolve, and disappear altogether.</p>\n<p>I’m only just getting started on truly knowing the River Monnow and connecting with the land in a way that is grounded in experience, not just knowledge. And it’s under the pace of pedal power that this is best experienced.</p>\n<p>The Watershed was supported by Rab, Komoot, and ORTLIEB</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Watershed-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Watershed-2.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Watershed-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Watershed-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The route is available on <a href=\"https://www.komoot.com/collection/3446846/-the-watershed-a-ride-to-the-source-of-the-river-monnow\" target=\"_blank\">Komoot</a></p>\n<p>Writer &amp; producer:<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Rupert Barry</a><br />\nCinematography: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/forthehellofit.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">Tudor Gilham</a><br />\nPhotography &amp; drone: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jim_cossey_photo/\" target=\"_blank\">Jim Cossey</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/the-watershed-pedalling-deeper/\">The Watershed: Pedalling Deeper in Search of the Source of My Local River</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"5c349eb4ba613fad6cb913388cec28c6ba03a46bf5f0aec68f6bc6e73115879d","category":"Cycling"}
