However, there is one key difference: he will complete the entire journey in a single continuous route, linking all the stages without external assistance and managing his own food and rest. His goal is to reach the capital of each organizing country before the official race concludes.</p>\n<p>The name <b>IGARE</b> holds special meaning for Javier. It comes from Kinyarwanda, one of the languages of Rwanda, and means bicycle. His connection with this African country dates back to 2020, when he traveled there and witnessed how bicycles play a crucial role in the daily lives of many people. Additionally, one of the challenge’s partner companies, Ritchey, has been involved in solidarity projects in Rwanda through its founder, Tom Ritchey.</p>\n<p>Beyond raising awareness of <b>Butterfly Skin</b>, this challenge also aims to raise funds for <b>DEBRA Butterfly Skin</b>, an association that supports affected families and promotes research to find a cure.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Javier-Garcia-Reboredo-IGARE-Challenge-1.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Javier-Garcia-Reboredo-IGARE-Challenge-1.jpeg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Javier-Garcia-Reboredo-IGARE-Challenge-1.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Javier-Garcia-Reboredo-IGARE-Challenge-1.jpeg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Supporters and Sponsors</h3>\n<p>The <b>IGARE</b> challenge is backed by several companies that have provided essential equipment and resources to help Javier complete his journey:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ritchey – Supplies the bicycle and its components.</li>\n<li>Silca – Providing tools and maintenance products to keep the bike in top condition.</li>\n<li>Old Man Mountain – Supplying racks and load carriers.</li>\n<li>Ruta 29 – Sending apparel from Colombia for the grueling ride.</li>\n<li>Cordel – Crafting handmade bags to store gear, especially food.</li>\n<li>René Herse – Providing high-quality tires to complete the challenge without punctures.</li>\n<li>Lezyne – Ensuring visibility and illumination along the route.</li>\n<li>Selo Roupa Bonita – Supplies casual wear for Javier to use at the end of each day.</li>\n<li>Follow My Challenge – The live tracking platform enabling real-time route updates.</li>\n<li>Strava – Recording and tracking the sporting data of this cycling feat.</li>\n<li>Frasen – They have provided the wheels and assembled the entire bike.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>The entire route can be tracked in real time on the official <b>IGARE</b> website: <a href=\"http://www.igare.cc\">www.igare.cc</a>.
