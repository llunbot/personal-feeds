{"title":"“Truly a middle finger”: Humane bricking $700 AI Pins with limited refunds","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/truly-a-middle-finger-humane-bricking-700-ai-pins-with-limited-refunds/","date":1739990918000,"content":"<p>After launching its AI Pin in April 2024 and reportedly <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/humane-ai-pin-founders-run-for-the-exits-one-month-after-launch/\">seeking a buyout</a> by May 2024, Humane is shutting down. Most of the people who bought an AI Pin will not get refunds for the devices, which <a href=\"1.%09Debut%20https:/arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/humane-ai-pin-a-700-voice-command-box-definitely-wont-replace-your-phone/\">debuted at $700</a>, dropped to $500, and will be bricked on February 28 at noon PT.</p>\n<p>At that time, AI Pins, which are lapel pins with an integrated AI voice assistant, camera, speaker, and laser projector, “will no longer connect to Humane’s servers,” and “all customer data, including personal identifiable information... will be permanently deleted from Humane’s servers,” according to Humane’s <a href=\"https://support.humane.com/hc/en-us/articles/34243204841997-Ai-Pin-Consumers-FAQ\">FAQ page</a>. Humane also stopped selling AI pins as of yesterday and canceled any orders that had been made but not yet fulfilled. Humane said it is discontinuing the AI Pin because it’s “moving onto new endeavors.”</p>\n<p>Those new endeavors include selling off key assets, including the AI Pin’s CosmOS operating system and intellectual property, including over 300 patents and patent applications, to HP for $116 million, HP announced on Tuesday. HP expects the acquisition to close this month.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/truly-a-middle-finger-humane-bricking-700-ai-pins-with-limited-refunds/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/truly-a-middle-finger-humane-bricking-700-ai-pins-with-limited-refunds/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"200618ac32f1bcbdd266c8efb35a32a496c9187ac83e130b86cfe6b6e2535dc5","category":"Tech"}
