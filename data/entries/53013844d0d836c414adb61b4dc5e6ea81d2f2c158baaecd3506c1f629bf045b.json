Apple <a href=\"https://x.com/alexocheema/status/1899604613135028716\">provided him with two M3 Ultra Mac Studios</a>, each maxed out with 512 GB of unified memory. Within a day, he had them linked together by Thunderbolt 5 and had the <em>full</em> DeepSeek R1 model running on his desk.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, that’s over $20,000 of computing hardware. But to my knowledge there is no other way in the world to run the full DeepSeek R1 model for even <em>close</em> to $20,000, let alone doing it on your desk rather than a data center. It’s an exclusive advantage, made possible by Apple Silicon’s general performance and the breakthrough of Apple’s <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10686/\">unified memory architecture</a>, which lets the GPU cores access the same RAM as the CPU cores.</p>\n\n<p>Apple has tremendous technical advantages to offer in AI. But they’re marketing Genmojis of hot dogs carrying briefcases.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/apple-silicon-is-groundbreaking-for-ai\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"53013844d0d836c414adb61b4dc5e6ea81d2f2c158baaecd3506c1f629bf045b","category":"Tech"}
