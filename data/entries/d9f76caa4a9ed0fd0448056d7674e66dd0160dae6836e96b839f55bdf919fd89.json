The bearings are used in previous-generation MacBook Air models, rather than the latest models, according to the report.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNone of the MacBook Air models with defective bearings reached the market, the report added:<blockquote>Industry insiders indicate that the defects were present from the beginning, but Apple only detected them during destructive testing later in the process. A subsequent full batch inspection revealed a high defect rate. Fortunately, none of the faulty products have reached the market. However, bearing defects typically take one to two years of use before becoming noticeable to consumers.</blockquote>It is unclear exactly which component the report is referring to.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe report cites industry sources who believe that Apple's alleged \"aggressive pricing tactics\" with component vendors increases the risk of quality issues.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/19/macbook-air-supplier-quality-issues-report/\">Apple Reportedly Suspends MacBook Air Supplier Due to 'Quality Issues'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-suspends-macbook-air-supplier-due-to-quality-issues.2437065/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d9f76caa4a9ed0fd0448056d7674e66dd0160dae6836e96b839f55bdf919fd89","category":"Apple"}
