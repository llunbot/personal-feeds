From pizza and pasta to that decadent slice of cheesecake, we can’t get enough. But the dairy industry that produces cheese has had a negative impact on our climate that is not exactly appetizing.</p>\n<p>While plant-based alternatives to cheese are easier on the environment—not to mention ideal for those who are lactose intolerant (raises hand) or vegan—many of them are still not cheesy enough. Now, a team of scientists from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark has created nondairy cheese with a taste and texture that’s much closer to the real thing. Instead of developing some sort of futuristic technology, they harnessed the transformative power of a process that has been used to make traditional cheese for thousands of years—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/04/science-confirms-it-the-best-kimchi-is-made-in-traditional-clay-jars-onggi/\">fermentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Just add bacteria</h2>\n<p>Why are <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/09/big-dairy-still-sour-over-plant-based-milk-labels-tries-to-outlaw-them/\">plant-based</a> cheeses so notoriously difficult to make?
