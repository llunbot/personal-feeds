The fox studies the problem while the Tin Man and the dragon sip a Coors and look on, and offer the sage (and largely ineffective) advice all cyclists offer when we’re bystanders, “Yeah, but did it fall on the inside or the outside of the chain ring?” After about five minutes, the dragon shouts over the DJ, “Is there a mechanic in the house?!?” Fortunately, they’re in “Heckle Hollow,” the rowdy (often inebriated) mosh pit of unwashed friends from the bike community. So yeah, there are a few mechanics in the house.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1909\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-61.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-61.jpg?w=1909&amp;quality=75 1909w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-61.jpg?resize=1024,715&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-61.jpg?resize=768,536&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-61.jpg?resize=1800,1257&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-61.jpg?resize=1335,932&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-61.jpg?resize=700,489&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-61.jpg?resize=1536,1073&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>One of them risks his life crossing the path of crushed Dixie Cups (handups), smashed Twinkees (failed handups), and other carnage (who’s riding out here without a shoe?) to help the fox figure this shit out. Moments later, the wheels are spinning again, the crowd erupts with a cheer and they push off, dragon facing backwards, smiling and wild.

From time to time, professional cyclists enter the melee. Tour pro, <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/lachlan-morton/\" target=\"_blank\">Lachlan Morton</a>, moved to the area a bit ago and had the same look of awe on his face as any other racer lining up in the rodeo grounds for the first time. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cy4u_fTra9h/?img_index=2\">Geoff Kabush</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CVte0mSvthr/?img_index=2\">Emily Kachorek</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cy6PPGexWnf/?img_index=1\">Katerina Nash</a> have all come out to take their handups because IYKYK.</p>\n<p>But this isn’t about Lachlan. Or pros. Or competition, really. There are plenty of places and airtime for that scene. RodeoCross is really about the love of bikes and the community of people who come together to pull this off every season.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"889\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-28.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-28.jpg?w=889&amp;quality=75 889w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-28.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-28.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"889\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-23.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-23.jpg?w=889&amp;quality=75 889w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-23.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-23.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"889\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-11.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-11.jpg?w=889&amp;quality=75 889w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-11.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-11.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /></p>\n<h3>Dawn Til Dusk</h3>\n<p>Most riders who come out to RodeoCross have very little idea of the planning, hard work, and sheer physical labor that goes into setting up and tearing down the course each week. For the main crew, setup starts with insurance and permitting. Day of, the work starts at 9am and goes past 10pm. It’s hanging lights, packing down safety hazards, dropping generators, driving posts, posting signage, putting up tape, walking the course, setting up timing, watching hundreds of riders come through and party…then disassembling the whole thing in the same night.</p>\n<p>None of it happens without sponsors and volunteers, of course. Mike’s Bikes covers juniors’ race fees, and there’s ample support from local bike shop In Velo Veritas, TREK Folsom, PNW Components, Squid Bikes, Bn3th, and Michael David Wine. For beverage selections, our beloved Bike Dog Brewery, Red Bus, and Best Day keep the fray properly hydrated.</p>\n<p>Despite the anarchy, Frank and his team set a tone of respect and general “hey, don’t be a dick” attitude that is largely unspoken, but somehow sets the entire vibe. Every night, miraculously, the DJ cuts the music by 10 to observe the noise ordinance, the Hollow is free and clear of all evidence of debauchery, and the gates are locked.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"959\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-48.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-48.jpg?w=959&amp;quality=75 959w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-48.jpg?resize=768,1068&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-48.jpg?resize=700,973&amp;quality=75 700w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"929\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-46.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-46.jpg?w=929&amp;quality=75 929w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-46.jpg?resize=768,1102&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-46.jpg?resize=700,1004&amp;quality=75 700w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"968\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-49.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-49.jpg?w=968&amp;quality=75 968w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-49.jpg?resize=768,1058&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-49.jpg?resize=700,964&amp;quality=75 700w\" /></p>\n<p>The crew, in their own words…</p>\n<p><strong>Frank Shoemaker</strong>: “I’m just a cyclocross-pusher trying to catch more addicts. I had a friend who raced on her daughter’s Walmart mountain bike because she just wanted to do it, and that’s the people I’m going for: the ones on the fence. Bike racing looks intimidating, but we’re going to make it something you need to be in the middle of.”</p>\n<p><strong>Asa Salas</strong>: “What makes RodeoCross unique is that it’s always been a little weird and welcoming. The community has always been a little weird, which makes it more inviting for people who are nervous about “racing.” There’s a thin line between safety and sanity, but at the end of the night, when we close the gates and the last people are gone, it’s got energy that’s unlike any other race.”</p>\n<p><strong>Cabot O’Callaghan</strong>: “I helped out those first few years, but during the race I’d have some beers and watch people race. Now, I’m constantly monitoring the course; I put in over 40,000 steps. So, I take pride in it now, too.”</p>\n<p><strong>John Simmons</strong>: “Being a Marine, it’s important to stay connected socially and physically; it helps me cope mentally. Like so much in life, there’s a handful of people who step up and make something happen. Most people show up and enjoy it, which is why we do it, but it’s probably my way of building up my karma bank. It builds the community and someone’s gotta do it.”</p>\n<p><strong>Renee Roberts</strong>: “I’m an emergency paramedic and I do standby medical at cycling events. We mostly see slide-outs and abrasions on knees and elbows. Occasional collarbones. We had a few encounters last week with rider vs. tree. Most of the time they stay rubber side down.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"926\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-2.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-2.jpg?w=926&amp;quality=75 926w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-2.jpg?resize=768,1106&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-2.jpg?resize=700,1008&amp;quality=75 700w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"889\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-32.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-32.jpg?w=889&amp;quality=75 889w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-32.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-32.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"916\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-62.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-62.jpg?w=916&amp;quality=75 916w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-62.jpg?resize=768,1118&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Rodeocross-62.jpg?resize=700,1019&amp;quality=75 700w\" /></p>\n<h3>RodeoCross 101</h3>\n<p>Sure, it’s cyclocross….kinda.

It looks like a race, but it’s a disguise for a party on bikes.

That, to me, is the spirit of RodeoCross.”<br />\n– Christine Foster</p>\n<p>“You ride in the grass and the dirt and some hills and you might have to get off your bike and climb a hill then get back on and it’s terrible but you’re gonna love it.
