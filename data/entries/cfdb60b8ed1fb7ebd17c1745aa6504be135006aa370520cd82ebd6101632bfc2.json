There are <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1j9y79p/icloud_mail_not_pushing_on_ios_1832/\">multiple complaints on Reddit</a> and the <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/18-3-2-ios-ipados-no-mail-notifications-or-updates.2452926/\"><em>MacRumors</em> forums</a> from users who say that ‌iCloud‌ Mail is not able to push new ‌iCloud‌ emails to their iPhones after the iOS 18.3.2 update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/General-iOS-Mail-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nAffected users say that despite having the correct settings enabled, new ‌iCloud‌ emails are not showing up in their inboxes until a manual refresh. From a Reddit user:\r<br />\n<blockquote>I'm experiencing an issue with iCloud Mail on my iPhone after updating to iOS 18.3.2. New emails are not being pushed to my device, even though all the correct settings are enabled and it had been working fine on 18.3.1. Manually refreshing the Mail app does retrieve new emails, but they do not arrive automatically via push.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven this issue appears to be tied to the iOS 18.3.2 update, I assume it's a bug. Is anyone else experiencing this issue?</blockquote>\r<br />\nPush is a feature that's available for some email services like ‌iCloud‌ Mail. It is meant to deliver incoming emails as soon as they arrive, so users see new messages right away. Other accounts use Fetch, which means that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> checks the email server every so often for new emails. It appears neither Push nor Fetch is working for some ‌iCloud‌ Mail users, based on the complaints.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPush email from other providers like Microsoft appears to be working with no problem, so the issue is limited to ‌iCloud‌ Mail. Some users have also seen the same lack of Mail push with iOS 18.4. Given the number of users affected, Apple is likely aware of the issue, and hopefully a fix will be coming in the near future.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/ios-18-3-2-icloud-mail-issue/\">iOS 18.3.2 Broke iCloud Mail Delivery</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-3-2-broke-icloud-mail-delivery.2453359/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cfdb60b8ed1fb7ebd17c1745aa6504be135006aa370520cd82ebd6101632bfc2","category":"Apple"}
