Members of a pro-Russia and Belarus hacking group tracked as Winter Vivern used the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting\">XSS bug</a> to inject JavaScript into the Roundcube server application. The injection was triggered simply by viewing a malicious email, which caused the server to send emails from selected targets to a server controlled by the threat actor.</p>\n<h2>No manual interaction required</h2>\n<p>“In summary, by sending a specially crafted email message, attackers are able to load arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the Roundcube user’s browser window,” ESET researcher Matthieu Faou <a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/winter-vivern-exploits-zero-day-vulnerability-roundcube-webmail-servers/\">wrote</a>. “No manual interaction other than viewing the message in a web browser is required.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978806#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978806&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9f51bc7d127012cecdc208defe6bb607c58d1e25e535a52733712760350f0ceb","category":"Tech"}
