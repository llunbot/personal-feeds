{"title":"Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram, Arrested in France","link":"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/telegram-messaging-app-ceo-pavel-durov-arrested-france-tf1-tv-says-2024-08-24/","date":1724635537000,"content":"\n<p>Reuters:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Pavel Durov, the Russian-born billionaire founder and owner of the\nTelegram messaging app, was arrested at Le Bourget airport outside\nParis shortly after landing on a private jet late on Saturday and\nplaced in custody, three sources told Reuters.</p>\n\n<p>The arrest of the 39-year-old technology billionaire prompted on\nSunday a warning from Moscow to Paris that he should be accorded\nhis rights and criticism from X owner Elon Musk who said that free\nspeech in Europe was under attack.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Such a warning is particularly rich coming from Russia so soon after the negotiated release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Durov, who has dual French and United Arab Emirates citizenship,\nwas arrested as part of a preliminary police investigation into\nallegedly allowing a wide range of crimes due to a lack of\nmoderators on Telegram and a lack of cooperation with police, a\nthird French police source said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t yet have enough information to form an opinion on this arrest, but I will emphasize one point. There’s a reaction going around that this is ridiculous because Telegram is “encrypted” and thus can’t be moderated so arresting Durov for failing to moderate Telegram is a backdoor way of arresting him for providing encrypted communication. This is the result of a yearslong propaganda campaign by Telegram to describe itself using adjectives like “encrypted” and “secure”. It’s not. But the propaganda campaign <a href=\"https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2024/08/25/telegram-is-not-really-an-encrypted-messaging-app/\">has been extraordinarily successful</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s Signal founder Moxie Marlinspike back in February 2022, who, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/10/26/taking-back-our-privacy\">say what you will</a> about Signal and the Signal Foundation, knows his shit about actual end-to-end encryption:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Telegram is the most popular messenger in urban Ukraine. After a\ndecade of misleading marketing and press, most ppl there believe\nit’s an “encrypted app”</p>\n\n<p>The reality is the opposite-TG is by default a cloud database w/ a\nplaintext copy of every msg everyone has ever sent/recvd.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One-on-one chats in Telegram are not encrypted by default and group chats never are. Telegram employees have access to every single message ever sent to every group.</p>\n\n<p>So, given how widely used Telegram is — perhaps especially in Ukraine — you can see why Russia is upset that Durov was arrested.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/25/durov-france-arrest\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7cf46ec665c642edc92262c0a03635794d6f212f1bc51e5563088cdeecaa5d18","category":"Tech"}
