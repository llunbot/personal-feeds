The design of this menu draws similarities to visionOS, the operating system that runs on Apple's new Vision Pro headset, which launched in the U.S. last week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also plans to redesign various other system menus and built-in apps on iOS 18, including Safari, according to the report.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-tv-app-redesign.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" /><div><em>Apple TV app menu bar on tvOS 17.2</em></div>\r<br />\nWe consider this rumor to be \"sketchy\" because <em>The Verifier</em> has a <a href=\"https://appletrack.com/the-verifier/\">mixed track record</a> with Apple rumors over the years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will introduce iOS 18 at its annual developers conference WWDC in June, and the first beta should be available shortly after the announcement. The update will be released to all users in September alongside the iPhone 16 lineup.
