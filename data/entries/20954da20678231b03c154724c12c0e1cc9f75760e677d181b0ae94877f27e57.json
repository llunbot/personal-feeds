The new shades are meant to be neutral, standing out less than white AirPods when the earbuds are in the ears. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/colorware-blended-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"859\" />\r<br />\nThere are three colors available for each product, including a light, cream colored \"Glaze\" shade, a mid-toned brown called \"Toasty,\" and \"Java,\" a darker brown color. The colors are reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/15/kim-kardashian-beats-studio-pro/\">neutral color options</a> Apple has introduced for its Beats line in partnership with Kim Kardashian.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nColorWare is known for custom painting Apple devices, and has been making electronics in custom colors for more than a decade. The company offers tons of other colors for the AirPods, employing a proprietary painting method that ensures longevity for the added paint.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/colorware-blended-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nCustom AirPods come with a premium price. The Blended ‌AirPods Max‌ are $849, the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 are $439, and the ‌AirPods 4‌ are $329 for the standard version and $379 for the ANC model. Other than the custom color, the AirPods are unchanged so performance and feature set remains the same as standard AirPods from Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/colorware-mac-mini.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nColorWare <a href=\"https://www.colorware.com/collections/mac-mini-light-retro\">also recently came out</a> with custom \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a> Retro\" colors, featuring a rainbow Apple logo.
