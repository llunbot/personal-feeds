We best know his current suspension designs from those developed with his brother Lance Canfield for <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=canfieldbikes\" target=\"_blank\">his eponymous bike brand</a>, and also for full-suspension <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=revelbikes\" target=\"_blank\">Revel Bikes</a>, both of which license his CBF – Canfield Balance Formula</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But he has plenty more crazy suspension ideas, so decided it was time to turn it all into one ultimate DH bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chris-Canfield-podcast-interview-FEATURE.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Chris-Canfield-podcast-interview-FEATURE-edited.webp\" alt=\"chris canfield interview about mountain bike suspension design\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Chris-Canfield-podcast-interview-FEATURE-edited.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Chris-Canfield-podcast-interview-FEATURE-edited-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Chris-Canfield-podcast-interview-FEATURE-edited-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Chris-Canfield-podcast-interview-FEATURE-edited-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Chris-Canfield-podcast-interview-FEATURE-edited-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Chris-Canfield-podcast-interview-FEATURE-edited-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris also sat down with us about a year and a half ago for the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/podcast-086-chris-canfield-explains-multi-link-suspension-designs/\" target=\"_blank\">Bikerumor Podcast Ep. 086</a> to explain multi-link mountain bike suspension designs in a way that more of us could understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, so what’s new here, and what carries over.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Canfield Balance Formula patent tech</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Vampire-Fastarossa-DH-bike-low-mid-high-pivot-adjustable-CF3-suspension_red-frame.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Vampire-Fastarossa-DH-bike-low-mid-high-pivot-adjustable-CF3-suspension_red-frame.webp\" alt=\"Vampire Fastarossa DH bike low mid high pivot adjustable CF3 suspension, red frame\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Vampire-Fastarossa-DH-bike-low-mid-high-pivot-adjustable-CF3-suspension_red-frame.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Vampire-Fastarossa-DH-bike-low-mid-high-pivot-adjustable-CF3-suspension_red-frame-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Vampire-Fastarossa-DH-bike-low-mid-high-pivot-adjustable-CF3-suspension_red-frame-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Vampire-Fastarossa-DH-bike-low-mid-high-pivot-adjustable-CF3-suspension_red-frame-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Vampire-Fastarossa-DH-bike-low-mid-high-pivot-adjustable-CF3-suspension_red-frame-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>First, let’s start with CBF, this is Chris’s patent that’s already out there on a lot of bikes. Basically, it is a virtual pivot design where the Instant Center (that’s essentially the momentary virtual pivot at any point throughout a bike’s travel) is always in line with the top of your chain, as it comes off your chainring delivering power to the rear wheel. As the rear wheel goes up, the IC goes down to stay aligned with the taut section of your chain under load. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canfieild explains that this results in “maximum pedaling efficiency” but also means the bike will have no brake-jack and no brake-squat, so balanced braking, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s new is CF3 – Chris’ Formula Three</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Vampire-Fastarossa-DH-bike-low-mid-high-pivot-adjustable-CF3-suspension_rear-end-detail.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Vampire-Fastarossa-DH-bike-low-mid-high-pivot-adjustable-CF3-suspension_rear-end-detail.webp\" alt=\"Vampire Fastarossa DH bike low mid high pivot adjustable CF3 suspension, rear end detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Vampire-Fastarossa-DH-bike-low-mid-high-pivot-adjustable-CF3-suspension_rear-end-detail.webp 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Vampire-Fastarossa-DH-bike-low-mid-high-pivot-adjustable-CF3-suspension_rear-end-detail-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Vampire-Fastarossa-DH-bike-low-mid-high-pivot-adjustable-CF3-suspension_rear-end-detail-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Vampire-Fastarossa-DH-bike-low-mid-high-pivot-adjustable-CF3-suspension_rear-end-detail-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Vampire-Fastarossa-DH-bike-low-mid-high-pivot-adjustable-CF3-suspension_rear-end-detail-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Vampire-Fastarossa-DH-bike-low-mid-high-pivot-adjustable-CF3-suspension_rear-end-detail-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Vampire-Fastarossa-DH-bike-low-mid-high-pivot-adjustable-CF3-suspension_rear-end-detail-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Vampire-Fastarossa-DH-bike-low-mid-high-pivot-adjustable-CF3-suspension_rear-end-detail-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The core of what makes this bike so unique is its three main pivot locations. Chris Canfield said he wanted one DH bike that could do it all “<em>a race bike that could handle any track, from rock gardens to bike park air DH courses. It had to be versatile enough to adapt to all of them.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, instead of picking a low, mid, or high-pivot design, Canfield just gives you all three in one frame. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swapping apparently takes just a few minutes – just unbolt the main pviot axle, pull it out and place it back where you want to try next.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a

significantly changes both suspension travel and rear axle path. Think 165mm in low, 180mm in mid, and 220mm in high. It even keeps a relatively consistent shock cure so you get a similar feel throughout, just with higher leverage as you raise the main pivot and extend travel. Canfield explains that you can usually set your ideal spring setup in the middle position and then add high-speed compression damping going up a hole or lower HSC going down (plus 1 click of rebound for each hole going up.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That way you can get three bikes in one – from enduro bike feel to pro DH shredder – all quick and easy to swap back and forth depending on how you want to ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>I-Track Suspension license</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The final patent that makes the new Vampire Fastarossa DH bike tick is the <a href=\"https://i-tracksuspension.com/\" target=\"_blank\">i-track dynamic idler pulley</a> design that Canfield licenses from Australian suspension designer Hugh McLay. Mounting the i-track idler pulley on the Fastarossa’s swingarm means that as you pedal harder, a bit more tension (anti-squat) is added to the suspension so it stays more stable when you put the power down. And the force is stronger earlt in the travel, having less impact when you push the bike deeper into its travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vampire Fastarossa DH – Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a
