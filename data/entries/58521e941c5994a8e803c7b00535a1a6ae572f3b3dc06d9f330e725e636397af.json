{"title":"The DMA Has Crippled Google Search in the EU","link":"https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/an-update-on-our-preparations-for-the-dma/","date":1710378170000,"content":"\n<p>Oliver Bethel, legal director at Google, back in January, on changes to search results in the EU:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When you are searching for something like a hotel, or something to \nbuy, we often show information to help you find what you need, \nlike pictures and prices, as part of our results. Sometimes this \ncan be as part of a result for a single business like a hotel or \nrestaurant, or sometimes it can be a featured group of relevant \nresults. Over the coming weeks in Europe, we will be expanding our \ntesting of a number of changes to the search results page. We will \nintroduce dedicated units that include a group of links to \ncomparison sites from across the web, and query shortcuts at the \ntop of the search page to help people refine their search, \nincluding by focusing results just on comparison sites. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Most of those comparison sites are garbage. I suspect these changes will make Google Search far less useful for hotels and shopping.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For categories like hotels, we will also start testing a dedicated \nspace for comparison sites and direct suppliers to show more \ndetailed individual results including images, star ratings and \nmore. These changes will result in the removal of some features \nfrom the search page, such as the Google Flights unit. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unreal. Google Flights is the best cross-airline search tool I’m aware of. Years ago <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/03/29/hipmunk\">I used Hipmunk</a> — which was great — but, alas, <a href=\"https://onefoottsunami.com/2021/05/12/a-paean-to-hipmunk/\">they shut down in January 2020</a>. I presume people in the EU can still go to the dedicated Google Flights page, but just typing “PHL to SFO” on Google’s homepage or in your browser’s location field is what most people expect to work.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/13/google-search-dma\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"58521e941c5994a8e803c7b00535a1a6ae572f3b3dc06d9f330e725e636397af","category":"Tech"}
