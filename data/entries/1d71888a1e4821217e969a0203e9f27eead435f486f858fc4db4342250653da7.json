In tribute to this anticipation, 7mesh introduces its ‘Higher Ground’ spring 2023 collection. The collection includes a few all-new pieces of gear for MTB, road, and gravel riders, and most garments are available in men’s and women’s models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article will focus on new items for 2023, but check out 7mesh’s website to see updated colors for popular ongoing pieces or to explore their entire spring 2023 lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7mesh 2023 MTB Gear:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Flightpath-pant-mens-peat.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1031\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Flightpath-pant-mens-peat-800x1031.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Flightpath-pant-mens-peat-800x1031.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Flightpath-pant-mens-peat-233x300.jpg 233w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Flightpath-pant-mens-peat-93x120.jpg 93w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Flightpath-pant-mens-peat-768x990.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Flightpath-pant-mens-peat.jpg 931w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>7mesh’s new Flightpath Pant is a warm-weather pant that’s designed to be cool, breathable, lightweight, and offer excellent pedaling ergonomics. However, the pants are still durable, abrasion resistant, and tough enough for bike park laps or rough trails. Men’s and women’s models are available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Flightpath Pants’ main fabric blend of Nylon/Elastane provides a high level of stretch, plus an articulated knee panel and stretch gusset at the back of the leg ensure total mobility. For storage, you get two hand pockets and two zippered side pockets with internal mesh sleeves for lift passes, valuables, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Flightpath-pant-waist-adjuster.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Flightpath-pant-waist-adjuster-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Flightpath-pant-waist-adjuster-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Flightpath-pant-waist-adjuster-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Flightpath-pant-waist-adjuster-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Flightpath-pant-waist-adjuster-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Flightpath-pant-waist-adjuster-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Flightpath-pant-waist-adjuster.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A hook and ladder waist adjuster allows for size adjustment in a slim fashion, and the pants feature a zippered fly with a single button.

Women’s color choices are Black or Bottle Blue, and sizes XS-XXL are available. MSRP is $250.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After my recent <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/7mesh-headquarters-tour-adapting-to-a-future-of-pfas-free-outerwear/\">headquarters visit</a>, 7mesh set me up with a pair of the Flightpath Pants so watch for a review sometime later this summer!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Roam-shirt-mens.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"978\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Roam-shirt-mens-800x978.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Roam-shirt-mens-800x978.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Roam-shirt-mens-246x300.jpg 246w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Roam-shirt-mens-98x120.jpg 98w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Roam-shirt-mens-768x938.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Roam-shirt-mens.jpg 982w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Roam series shirts offer all the options for trail riding men or women – short sleeve, ¾ sleeve, or long sleeve. The Roam trail shirts are built with a durable but breathable and quick-drying outer fabric, which is joined to a textured backing fabric that prevents the shirt from clinging to your skin. Details are a bit scant, as the Roam shirts were not yet shown on 7mesh’s website at press time, however, the provided photos reveal a simple T-style cut with a rounded collar. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Roam-LS-shirt-womens.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"911\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Roam-LS-shirt-womens-800x911.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Roam-LS-shirt-womens-800x911.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Roam-LS-shirt-womens-264x300.jpg 264w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Roam-LS-shirt-womens-105x120.jpg 105w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Roam-LS-shirt-womens-768x874.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Roam-LS-shirt-womens.jpg 1054w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Roam series shirts’ colors and graphics were inspired by 7mesh’s testing grounds – Squamish, B.C.’s world-class singletrack trails. The patterns on the chest and arms are based on heat maps of Squamish’s trail networks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Roam trail shirts should be available by the end of March. Prices are as follows; Short sleeve – $70, ¾ sleeve – $75, Long Sleeve – $80. Keep an eye on 7mesh’s website for color and size options.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7mesh 2023 Road and Gravel Gear:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-RK2-cargo-bibs-mens.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1042\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-RK2-cargo-bibs-mens-800x1042.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-RK2-cargo-bibs-mens-800x1042.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-RK2-cargo-bibs-mens-230x300.jpg 230w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-RK2-cargo-bibs-mens-92x120.jpg 92w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-RK2-cargo-bibs-mens-768x1001.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-RK2-cargo-bibs-mens.jpg 921w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For 2023 7mesh has completely redesigned its RK series bib shorts. The new models feature cargo options and are now available in women’s styles. The RK2 shorts are built from a light, airy Italian fabric and are treated with Coldblack UPF so your legs will stay cool in the sunshine. They feature a custom elastic interface chamois and soft bib straps. The cargo version adds roomy pockets on both legs for extra storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-RK2-cargo-bibs-womens.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1047\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-RK2-cargo-bibs-womens-800x1047.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-RK2-cargo-bibs-womens-800x1047.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-RK2-cargo-bibs-womens-229x300.jpg 229w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-RK2-cargo-bibs-womens-92x120.jpg 92w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-RK2-cargo-bibs-womens-768x1005.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-RK2-cargo-bibs-womens.jpg 917w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The men’s bibs feature a traditional upper with a back panel and shoulder strap design, while the women’s model features 7mesh’s Pull2P straps that cross on the back and allow for mid-ride pit stops!  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RK2 shorts were not yet online at the time of writing… 7mesh’s supplied photos only show black/white colors for men and women, and keep an eye on their website for sizing info.

The Ashlu LS jersey’s main fabric is an ultra-fine wool fiber wrapped around Nylon cores, which combines the thermoregulation and antibacterial benefits of Merino wool with the stretch and durability of synthetic fibers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Ashlu-merino-LS-back.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"993\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Ashlu-merino-LS-back-800x993.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Ashlu-merino-LS-back-800x993.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Ashlu-merino-LS-back-242x300.jpg 242w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Ashlu-merino-LS-back-97x120.jpg 97w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Ashlu-merino-LS-back-768x953.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Ashlu-merino-LS-back.jpg 967w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ashlu long sleeve provides a generous amount of storage, with five of 7mesh’s Anything Pockets on the lower back. It features a trim fit with articulated sleeves, a full-length front zipper, and offers UPF 50+ sun protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Ashlu-LS-woman-riding.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Ashlu-LS-woman-riding-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Ashlu-LS-woman-riding-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Ashlu-LS-woman-riding-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Ashlu-LS-woman-riding-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Ashlu-LS-woman-riding-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Ashlu-LS-woman-riding-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7mesh-Ashlu-LS-woman-riding.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>*Images c. 7mesh</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Men’s and women’s models sell for $200.
