{"title":"iPhone 14 Pro Models to Feature Hole-Punch Display","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/iphone-14-hole-punch-display/","date":1639006836000,"content":"The high-end <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> Pro models launching in 2022 are expected to have a hole-punch display, according to Korean website <em><a href=\"http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=3665\">The Elec</a></em>. The 6.1-inch ‌iPhone 14‌ Pro and a 6.7-inch ‌iPhone 14‌ Pro Max are expected to feature the upgraded display, which will do away with the notch used in the current <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iPhone-14-Mock-Feature-Pruple-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe hole-punch cutout will allow Apple to provide a larger display area while still leaving room for the front-facing camera, and it is a design that Android devices have used for a few years now. If Apple does transition to this design, the Face ID hardware will need to be moved under the display.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTwo additional non-Pro iPhones, which will measure in at 6.1 and 6.7 inches, will continue to have a notch, with Apple limiting the hole-punch design to the more expensive iPhones. Apple is doing away with the 5.4-inch \"‌iPhone‌ mini\" in 2022, and is instead going to offer a four ‌iPhone‌ lineup in 6.1 and 6.7-inch sizes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>The Elec</em> says that Apple will also be sourcing LTPO OLED displays for the ‌iPhone 14‌ Pro models to allow for 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates, technology already used in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a> models this year. Samsung supplied the OLED panels that Apple used for the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ models, but Apple could source some displays from LG Display in 2022.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA hole-punch display has been rumored several times before, and notable Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has said repeatedly that some ‌iPhone 14‌ Pro models are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/kuo-iphone-14-pro-hole-punch-48mp-camera/\">likely to feature the technology</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/iphone-14-hole-punch-display/\">iPhone 14 Pro Models to Feature Hole-Punch Display</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-14-pro-models-to-feature-hole-punch-display.2326759/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Ft5ooTBI0oQ:9_HQDGrQMUQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Ft5ooTBI0oQ:9_HQDGrQMUQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"998138008e4cc2458da00941f24afb317fee98ec354f08c7be4d50357a2bbafb","category":"Apple"}
