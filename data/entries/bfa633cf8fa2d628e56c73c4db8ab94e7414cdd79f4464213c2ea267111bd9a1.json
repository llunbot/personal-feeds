A key feature is Gemini Live, which wasn't available in the previous Google app implementation. When engaged in a conversation, Gemini Live appears in both the Dynamic Island and Lock Screen, letting you control your AI interactions without returning to the main app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe app is free to download, and Google offers premium features through Gemini Advanced subscriptions available as in-app purchases. Gemini Advanced is part of a Google One AI premium plan costing $18.99 per month. Apart from Gemini in Mail, Docs, and more, it includes access to Google's next-generation model, 1.5 Pro, priority access to new features, and a one million token context window. Users need to sign in with a Google account to access the service.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/google-gemini-app.jpg\" width=\"3240\" height=\"3030\" />\r<br />\nThe rollout follows an initial soft launch in the Philippines earlier this week, with availability now extending to additional regions including Australia, India, the US, and the UK. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nPreviously, iOS users could only access Gemini through a dedicated tab within the main Google app, which offered a more limited experience compared to the Android version. This standalone release, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/google-gemini/id6477489729\">available on the App Store</a>, brings feature parity closer between the two mobile platforms.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/14/google-releases-gemini-ai-app-iphone/\">Google Releases Standalone Gemini AI App for iPhone</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-releases-standalone-gemini-ai-app-for-iphone.2442952/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bfa633cf8fa2d628e56c73c4db8ab94e7414cdd79f4464213c2ea267111bd9a1","category":"Apple"}
