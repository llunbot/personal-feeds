Yes, please!","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2617636/800-for-an-m2-macbook-air-yes-please.html","date":1740414401000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>It may not be the newest model, but the M2 MacBook Air is a fantastic option for anyone looking for a good laptop. But it’s especially great when it’s on sale: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-MacBook-Laptop-chip/dp/B0DLHCWH55/\">Amazon just dropped the M2 MacBook Air to an amazing $800</a>, the best price we’ve seen in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing you should make sure you pay attention to when buying your M2 MacBook Air is that both the 8GB and 16GB versions are available for the same price, so you should make sure you’re adding the version with more memory to your cart. Until recently, Apple sold the 8GB model for the same price it now charges for the 16GB model, so this discount is like getting an extra $200 off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M2 chip delivers super-fast processing, and it’s ready to handle any task you want to take on, whether that’s something for work, streaming content, editing photos, and so on. There’s a 13.6-inch Liquid Retina Display that will make any image look gorgeous and a thin and light design that’s great for travel.
