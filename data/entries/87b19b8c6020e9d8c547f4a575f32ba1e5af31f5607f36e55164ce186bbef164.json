However, NASA has revealed that transistors on board the spacecraft may not be as radiation-hardened as they were believed to be.</p>\n<p>\"The issue with the transistors came to light in May when the mission team was advised that similar parts were failing at lower radiation doses than expected,\" the space agency wrote <a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/europaclipper/2024/07/11/nasa-continues-assessing-electrical-switches-on-europa-clipper/\">in a blog post</a> Thursday afternoon. \"In June 2024, an industry alert was sent out to notify users of this issue. The manufacturer is working with the mission team to support ongoing radiation test and analysis efforts in order to better understand the risk of using these parts on the Europa Clipper spacecraft.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036841#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036841&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"87b19b8c6020e9d8c547f4a575f32ba1e5af31f5607f36e55164ce186bbef164","category":"Tech"}
