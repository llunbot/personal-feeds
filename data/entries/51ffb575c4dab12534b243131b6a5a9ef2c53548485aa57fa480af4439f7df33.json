Researchers have shown the attacks can be used to give untrusted applications nearly unfettered system privileges, bypass security sandboxes designed to keep malicious code from accessing sensitive operating system resources, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/10/using-rowhammer-bitflips-to-root-android-phones-is-now-a-thing/\" target=\"_blank\">root</a> or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/05/drive-by-rowhammer-attack-uses-gpu-to-compromise-an-android-phone/\" target=\"_blank\">infect</a> Android devices, among other things.</p>\n\n<p>All previous Rowhammer attacks have hammered rows with uniform patterns, such as single-sided, double-sided, or n-sided. In all three cases, these “aggressor” rows—meaning those that cause bitflips in nearby “victim” rows—are accessed the same number of times.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1812861#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1812861&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"51ffb575c4dab12534b243131b6a5a9ef2c53548485aa57fa480af4439f7df33","category":"Tech"}
