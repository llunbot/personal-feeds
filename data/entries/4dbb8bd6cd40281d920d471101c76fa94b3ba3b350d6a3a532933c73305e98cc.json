GRID Studio is known for its Apple-themed works of art that are made from old, discarded Apple electronics that are disassembled so each individual component can be displayed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/grid-studio-grid-1.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nEach GRID piece is organized around the chassis of the device, with parts labeled and explanations provided so it's clear what's what. GRID Studio also includes interesting and relevant historical facts for added context.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are a range different GRID Studio frames that feature iPhones, iPads, and iPods, with prices that start at $40 and go up based on the complexity of the piece.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation\">GRID 1</a>, one of GRID Studio's most popular options, showcases the first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> that Apple ever made. Priced at $400, it features all of the components that Apple used for the original ‌iPhone‌ back in 2007. The ‌‌iPhone‌‌'s shell is positioned next to the power button, headphone socket, speaker, logic board, ear piece, and other components. GRID does not include the original batteries from the device, but replicas are added so the battery is not missing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/grid-iPhone2G.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE4s\">GRID 4s</a> is another iconic device that's available at a special price to celebrate GRID Studio's 3rd anniversary. Right now, it's just $99, down from the original $170 price tag. The Grid 4s has around 40 components from the ‌iPhone‌ 4s, all of which are neatly arranged and labeled.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/grid-iPhone4s.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThis year is the 10th anniversary of the colorful ‌iPhone‌ 5c, so GRID Studio has created the <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-iphone-5c\">$139 GRID iPhone 5C</a> using the bright blue ‌iPhone‌ 5C from 2013. With its polycarbonate shell, rounded corners, and unique colors, the ‌iPhone‌ 5C stands out from all other iPhones Apple has designed, and it was only sold for a short period before it was replaced.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/grid-iPhone5C.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nFor those looking for something unique, the $400 <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/u2-ipod\">GRID iPod U2</a> features the coveted black and red iPod from 2004. It came preloaded with U2 content, and it is appealing to iPod fans and U2 fans alike. The GRID iPod U2 features the iconic click wheel, the black chassis of the iPod, and quotes from both Bono and Steve Jobs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/grid-ipod-u2.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nAlong with deconstructed device art, GRID Studio has also recently gotten into t-shirts, and the $40 rainbow-colored <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/hellotshirt\">GRID Hello T-Shirt</a> is sure to be a favorite of any Apple fan. The classic hello script is created using tons of different device icons in various colors, so it is both colorful and visually interesting.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/grid-hello-t-shirt.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nFrom September 8 to September 10, GRID Studio is having a $99 sale <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE4s\">on the GRID 4s</a> for its anniversary, plus there's a 15 percent discount available on all other products with promo code T15.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGRID Studio will be providing one lucky <em>MacRumors</em> reader with a 512GB ‌iPhone 15‌ following Apple's event.
