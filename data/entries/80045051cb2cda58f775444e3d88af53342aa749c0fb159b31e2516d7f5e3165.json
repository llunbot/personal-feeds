Since his appointment as Florida's top doctor in late 2021, Ladapo has made false claims about vaccines, encouraged vaccine hesitancy, opposed masks, downplayed the health effects of COVID-19, and promoted ineffective COVID-19 treatments, such as <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2801827\">ivermectin</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923678#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923678&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"80045051cb2cda58f775444e3d88af53342aa749c0fb159b31e2516d7f5e3165","category":"Tech"}
