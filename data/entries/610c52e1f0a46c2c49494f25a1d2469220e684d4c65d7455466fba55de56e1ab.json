It's uncommon for a single product to create as much impact on the tech industry as ChatGPT has in just one year.</p>\n<p>Imagine a computer that can talk to you. Nothing new, right? Those have been around <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA\">since the 1960s</a>. But ChatGPT, the application that first brought <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/07/a-jargon-free-explanation-of-how-ai-large-language-models-work/\">large language models</a> (LLMs) to a wide audience, felt different. It could compose poetry, seemingly understand the context of your questions and your conversation, and help you solve problems. Within a few months, it became the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/chatgpt-sets-record-for-fastest-growing-user-base-in-history-report-says/\">fastest-growing</a> consumer application of all time. And it created a frenzy in the tech world.</p>\n\n<p>During these 365 days, ChatGPT has broadened the public perception of AI, captured imaginations, <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-emily-m-bender.html\">attracted critics</a>, and stoked existential angst.
