This effectively allows the same app to share code while running on separate platforms.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new WhatsApp app for macOS apparently looks very similar to the app for iPadOS, featuring the same basic interface, but there are some minor UI changes to accommodate a desktop experience. Presumably, this new Mac app will replace the existing macOS WhatsApp app and no longer rely on a connected smartphone.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new apps will be supported by multi-device capability, allowing users to use their WhatsApp account on up to four different linked devices even when their main smartphone is not connected to the internet. <em>WABetaInfo</em> said that WhatsApp will enable support for macOS at a later date, suggesting that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> app may be released first.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/\">WhatsApp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/project-catalyst/\">Project Catalyst</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/16/whatsapp-working-on-app-for-ipados-and-macos/\">WhatsApp Working on App for iPadOS and macOS Using Mac Catalyst</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-working-on-app-for-ipados-and-macos-using-mac-catalyst.2323605/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=84RhwTVjHS0:wGKOgYJroY4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=84RhwTVjHS0:wGKOgYJroY4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6b670bc8337da452af814aaf370035e962ee0c9c54c42c41a63ab8bd10c38017","category":"Apple"}
