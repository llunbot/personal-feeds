So far, that was enough to keep us going, but severe draughts have left places like Jordan, Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, Spain, and California with limited access to potable water.</p>\n<p>One possible solution is to tap into the remaining 97 percent of the water we have on Earth. The problem is that this water is saline, and we need to get the salt out of it to make it drinkable. Desalination is also an energy-expensive process. But MIT researchers led by Jonathan Bessette might have found an answer to that. They built an efficient, self-regulating water desalination system that runs on solar power alone with no need for batteries or a connection to the grid.</p>\n<h2>Probing the groundwaters</h2>\n<p>Oceans are the most obvious source of water for desalination. But they are a good option only for a small portion of people who live in coastal areas. Most of the global population—more or less 60 percent—lives farther than 100 kilometers from the coast, which makes using desalinated ocean water infeasible. So, Bessette and his team focused on groundwater instead.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/desalination-system-adjusts-itself-to-work-with-renewable-power/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/desalination-system-adjusts-itself-to-work-with-renewable-power/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jacek Krywko","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6ff746439ed4399687b9d82c388e19f65d1066575e6f1469da5d5224f4d68d45","category":"Tech"}
