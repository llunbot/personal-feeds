What could the space rock possibly be waiting to tell us?</p>\n<p>Asteroids are time capsules of the Solar System, containing material from early in its history. As a <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn8671\">2021 study</a> found, the Ryugu samples contained carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, all necessary ingredients for life, and a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01762-4\">2022 study</a> discovered evidence of water (and possibly a subsurface lake) that had long since dried up. Ryugu and its parent body were also revealed to carry some of the most ancient rocks in the Solar System. However, the pieces of this asteroid still had more to say.</p>\n<p>It turned out that two of the Ryugu samples each had a shard of something that visually stood out. Researchers discovered they were seeing fragments, or clasts, of rock with a chemical composition that differed from the rest of Ryugu. These clasts were higher in sulfur and iron, but lower in oxygen, magnesium, and silicon. That meant they could not have possibly formed with Ryugu, so they had to have been acquired through a later impact; but the asteroid still had more to say.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958414#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958414&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d8ae53d5e5f82fcbb493d58c30b671629cfbd2d97a8821e1d4b75b0a8914542c","category":"Tech"}
