For instance, researchers are developing 3D-printed <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDV61346.2024.10616604\">prosthetic hands</a> specifically designed for children, made with lightweight materials and adaptable control systems.</p>\n<p>These continuing advancements in 3D-printed prosthetics demonstrate their increasing affordability and accessibility. Success stories like this one in personalized prosthetics highlight the benefits of 3D printing, in which a model of an object produced with computer-aided design software is transferred to a 3D printer and constructed layer by layer.</p>\n<p>We are a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=F3VGsW0AAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">biomedical engineer</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.uwstout.edu/directory/freedmand\">chemist</a> who work with 3D printing. We study how this rapidly evolving technology provides new options not just for prosthetics but for implants, surgical planning, drug manufacturing, and other health care needs. The ability of 3D printing to make precisely shaped objects in a wide range of materials has led to, for example, custom replacement joints and custom-dosage, multidrug pills.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/how-3d-printing-is-personalizing-health-care/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/how-3d-printing-is-personalizing-health-care/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Anne Schmitz and Daniel Freedman, The Conversation","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3a95acc785b8abc65353e717655bef540237e67ce78554d02af2a70979645864","category":"Tech"}
