Apple <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/iphone/iphf538ea8d0/ios\">explains</a>:<blockquote>A passkey is a cryptographic entity that's not visible to you, and it's used in place of a password. A passkey consists of a key pair, which—compared to a password—profoundly improves security. One key is public, registered with the website or app you're using. The other key is private, held only by your devices.</blockquote>Passkey support for Apple IDs will also be available for third-party apps and websites that support the \"Sign in with Apple\" feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUsers running beta versions of iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS Sonoma can test this functionality on supported Apple sign-in pages starting today, but it does not yet appear to be available for everyone. All users with an Apple ID will be able to sign in with a passkey once the software updates are released to the public later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPasskey support on the Apple ID page was spotted earlier by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1671154639994011648\">Twitter user @aaronp613</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>As of this morning, it looks like you can now use Passkeys to sign in to <a href=\"https://t.co/vugFzZAxv4\">https://t.co/vugFzZAxv4</a>, requires iOS 17 though. <a href=\"https://t.co/WDJ83zx7TK\">pic.twitter.com/WDJ83zx7TK</a></p>— Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1671154639994011648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 20, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/\">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/passkeys/\">Passkeys</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243\">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/20/ios-17-macos-sonoma-apple-id-passkey/\">iOS 17 and macOS Sonoma Add Passkey Support to Your Apple ID</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-and-macos-sonoma-add-passkey-support-to-your-apple-id.2393632/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4fb1e01decce72989c0d76efe0614d14c075451269183a02cef41bd2bf390df2","category":"Apple"}
