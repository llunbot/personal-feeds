All of those eBikes lining the show floor are running similar lithium-ion battery tech… for now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like in the EV world of cars, battery tech is a hot topic. Sometimes quite literally as “eBike’ batteries have gone up in flames. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over at the Stromer booth, they were teasing what they consider to be the holy grail of battery tech – a lighter, safer option, that also charges much faster. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stromer-ceramic-ebike-battery-concept1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stromer-ceramic-ebike-battery-concept1-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Stromer Ceramic ebike battery plates\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stromer-ceramic-ebike-battery-concept1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stromer-ceramic-ebike-battery-concept1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stromer-ceramic-ebike-battery-concept1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stromer-ceramic-ebike-battery-concept1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stromer-ceramic-ebike-battery-concept1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stromer-ceramic-ebike-battery-concept1-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stromer-ceramic-ebike-battery-concept1.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While it’s still just a concept, Stromer has been working with TD Hitech as a supplier to create a new solid-state ceramic ebike battery. Made from layers of ceramic, the claim is that it will enable fast charging in an hour or less. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps more importantly, the ceramic plates could be more durable than lithium-ion cells and can be charged even if plates are broken. The battery tech will also supposedly allow for charging in colder conditions, down to -20c. As a bonus, it could also yield a lighter battery as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, this is all just a concept but Stromer says it could be here as early as 2025. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/stromer-teases-the-holy-grail-of-batteries-with-solid-state-ceramic-ebike-battery/\">Stromer Teases the ‘Holy Grail’ of Batteries with Solid State Ceramic eBike Battery</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1863ba6b6e799234009eb3829713fcf8b37295b61cc7bedefbc5e797c10c0d6e","category":"Cycling"}
