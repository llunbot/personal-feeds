{"title":"More on the Clooney-Pitt Movie ‘Wolfs’","link":"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/wolfs-jon-watts-interview-streaming-release-exclusive","date":1725380914000,"content":"\n<p>Apple Original Films had originally promised writer-director Jon Watts and co-stars George Clooney and Brad Pitt a wide theatrical release for their upcoming (and seemingly well-reviewed) movie <em>Wolfs</em>. But, pretty much at the last minute, Apple canceled those plans, and instead will screen it in limited theaters for one week before streaming it on Apple TV+ at the end of this month.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/wolfs-jon-watts-interview-streaming-release-exclusive\">David Canfield interviewed Watts for Vanity Fair</a>, where Watts said he only found out about the change in plans a few days before it was announced:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Canfield:</strong> <em>As somebody who’s worked in indies, who’s worked in\nthe MCU, and has now made a standalone studio movie, how do you\nsee the state of theatrical versus streaming, especially given the\npivot with this movie? Does it concern you at all?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Watts:</strong> You want the movie to be seen, and if you maximize the\nway that people are able to actually see a movie, I think that is\ngood — I watched so many movies that really influenced me on VHS\nbecause I grew up in a small town in Colorado, so we just didn’t\nhave those movies in the theaters. But for me, the theatrical\nexperience is still the number one. It’s up to the people that are\nable to make those decisions to put them in theaters for people to\nsee, and just have the confidence that people will go see them.\nPeople want to go to the movies. People love the movies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Canfield:</strong> <em>If you had known then what you know now about the\nway this movie will be released, would you have gone in another\ndirection, given that you were talking to a lot of studios?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Watts:</strong> [<em>Laughs</em>] I try to not think about hypothetical\nsituations like that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It doesn’t sound like Apple’s change of plans has resulted in bad blood, per se — merely disappointment. Watts has already agreed to write, produce, and direct a sequel. But it feels like Apple is still in the early stages of navigating its role as a Hollywood studio. I think there’s still a sense that Apple is a creator-friendly partner for big-budget movies, but a move like this, contradicting the obvious wishes of both the director and two of the biggest stars in the business, works against that reputation.</p>\n\n<p>Also, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/business/media/apple-movies-theaters-wolfs.html\">a week-ago report in The New York Times by Nicole Sperling</a> reported that Clooney and Pitt were paid “more than $35 million each”. But speaking at the Venice Film Festival premiere of <em>Wolfs</em> yesterday, <a href=\"https://people.com/george-clooney-denies-he-and-brad-pitt-were-paid-35-million-for-wolfs-8697837\">Clooney said that number was bullshit</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“[It was] an interesting article and whatever her source was for\nour salary, it is millions and millions and millions of dollars\nless than what was reported. And I am only saying that because I\nthink it’s bad for our industry if that’s what people think is the\nstandard bearer for salaries,” Clooney said. “I think that’s\nterrible, it’ll make it impossible to make films.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/03/more-wolfs\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4509e8f1ce0eede3c64274a85139887e207952a584952a66317f85f9a438306a","category":"Tech"}
