Users can also earn interest on personal funds deposited into the savings account through a linked bank account, or from their Apple Cash balance. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo open a savings account in the Wallet app, users can tap on the Apple Card, tap on the circle with three dots at the top of the screen, tap Daily Cash, and select Set Up Savings. Once the account is set up, all Daily Cash received from that point on will be automatically deposited into it and start earning interest. If they prefer, users will still be able to have Daily Cash added to their Apple Cash balance instead.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/\">Apple Card Savings Account Available Starting Today With 4.15% Interest Rate</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-card-savings-account-available-starting-today-with-4-15-interest-rate.2387038/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"690955ed6bea6f422c5c04d3b16b3b8ec404f0f21b72634883acba62cbb544ba","category":"Apple"}
