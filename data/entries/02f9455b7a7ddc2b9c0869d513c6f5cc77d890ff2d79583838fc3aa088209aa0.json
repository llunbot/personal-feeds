Users will have access to Apple Intelligence features after setting up their devices. To disable Apple Intelligence, users will need to navigate to the Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri Settings pane and turn off the Apple Intelligence toggle. This will disable Apple Intelligence features on their device.</blockquote>\r<br />\nWith ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.1 and ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.2, ‌Apple Intelligence‌ was opt-in rather than opt-out, and users who wanted the feature needed to turn it on in the Settings app. Going forward, it will be enabled by default, and Mac users who do not want to use the feature will need to turn it off.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.3 also brings <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/\">Genmoji</a> to the Mac for the first time, so Mac users will be able to create custom emoji characters after installing the update.
