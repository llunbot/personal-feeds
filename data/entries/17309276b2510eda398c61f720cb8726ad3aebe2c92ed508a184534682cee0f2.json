Apple is working on a new Magic Mouse with proper charging","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2557442/abracadabra-apple-is-working-on-a-new-magic-mouse-with-proper-charging.html","date":1734347700000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>When Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2503049/apples-mac-accessories-finally-switch-from-lightning-to-usb-c.html\">updated its lineup of Magic Mac accessories</a> in November, we didn’t get the redesign we were hoping for. All that changed was the Lightning ports, which were swapped out with USB-C ones. Everything else remained the same, including the Magic Mouse’s wonky upside-down charging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no significant updates since 2015, we assumed the Magic Mouse was forever doomed to charge through its belly. However, a new rumor from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman claims that Apple is actually working on a new Magic Mouse to finally address its critics‘ “longstanding complaints.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just the charging, though that’s easily the most criticized feature. The Magic Mouse has a very low profile that forces your hand to lie flatter while using it and contort somewhat uncomfortably to use the multi-touch gestures. As mice have gotten more ergonomic with taller designs and side buttons, the Magic Mouse has stubbornly stuck to its near-10-year-old vision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In plain language, Gurman says “Apple is looking to create something that’s more relevant, while also fixing longstanding complaints—yes, including the charging port issue.” Other than a new black color option in 2021 and the aforementioned USB-C port, Apple hasn’t changed anything about Magic Mouse since its 2015 debut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://x.com/MKBHD/status/1800927503445622851\">interview with Marques Brownlee at WWDC</a> earlier this year, Tim Cook defended the launch of the Magic Mouse as “an incredible moment” made possible by “getting the ergonomics right.” So even with a new model, Apple could opt to keep a similar design and focus its changes on a rear charging port and some modern features such as higher DPI and more customization options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you’re hoping to see the new Magic Mouse alongside the M4 Mac Pro or Mac Studio, Gurman says the accessory will likely arrive within the next 12 to 18 months, which likely puts its release some time in 2026. But for the first time in nearly a decade, we have hope.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"17309276b2510eda398c61f720cb8726ad3aebe2c92ed508a184534682cee0f2","category":"Apple"}
