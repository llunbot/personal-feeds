The yeast lurks in health care settings and preys upon vulnerable patients, causing invasive infections with a fatality rate of between 30 to 60 percent.</p>\n<p>In 2019, before the pandemic began, 17 states and Washington, DC, reported a total of 476 clinical cases. But in 2020, eight additional states reported cases for the first time, with the national clinical case count jumping 59 percent to 756. In 2021, 28 states were affected, with the clinical case count nearly doubling to 1,471. Asymptomatic cases detected through patient screening also jumped amid the pandemic, tripling from 1,310 cases in 2020 to 4,041 cases in 2021. The data appeared Monday <a href=\"https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M22-3469\">in the Annals of Internal Medicine.</a></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925412#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925412&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"582c89993473e76a4abbabb96be3553a7f28a276a2ae0bffb20655a90bd63d85","category":"Tech"}
