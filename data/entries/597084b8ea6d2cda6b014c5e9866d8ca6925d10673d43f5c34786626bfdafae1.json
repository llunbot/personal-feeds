It will keep using the term 10G in other ways, however.</p>\n<p>Verizon and T-Mobile both challenged Comcast's advertising of 10G, a term used by cable companies since it was unveiled in January 2019 by industry lobby group NCTA-The Internet &amp; Television Association. We <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/envious-of-5g-hype-cable-cos-unveil-potentially-confusing-10g-trademark/\">wrote in 2019</a> that the cable industry's 10G marketing was likely to confuse consumers and seemed to be a way of countering 5G hype generated by wireless companies.</p>\n<p>10G doesn't refer to the 10th generation of a technology. It is a reference to potential 10Gbps broadband connections, which would be much faster than the actual speeds on standard cable networks today.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000330#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000330&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"597084b8ea6d2cda6b014c5e9866d8ca6925d10673d43f5c34786626bfdafae1","category":"Tech"}
