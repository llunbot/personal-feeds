This year, the route will take the peloton northwards, along the North Coast, up Saltburn Bank, before crossing into Scotland for the first time in the race’s decade-long history. There the race resumes with a stage in the Borders before a city-centre finale in Glasgow, concluding right by the iconic People’s Palace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-britain-women-2024-photos\">Reigning champion Lotte Kopecky</a> has opted to miss the race this year, despite fond memories of Glasgow, where she won her first world title in 2023. Anna Henderson, last year’s runner-up, will be here to try and go one better, now in the colours of Lidl-Trek. She’ll be joined in the team bus by the only former winner to compete, Lizzie Deignan, who will be riding her final Tour of Britain before retiring later this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that said, t’s quite likely that we get a new name inscribed on the trophy this year. Among those expected to be up there in the GC, we have Classics star Kim Le Court-Pienaar, sprinter Lorena Wiebes, Olympic gold medalist Kristen Faulkner and young sensation Cat Ferguson among the names to choose from.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Kim Le Court-Pienaar (AG Insurance-Soudal)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0205-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0205-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0205-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0205-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0205-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0205-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0205-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0205-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0205-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0205-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0205-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0205-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After a stellar spring, Liège-Bastogne-Liège winner Kim Le Court-Pienaar is setting her eyes on a first WorldTour stage race victory at the Tour of Britain Women.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mauritian can handle the climbs, as proven in this year’s Ardennes Classics, and she has a decent enough kick to pick up some bonus seconds here and there. A stealthy GC campaign may be needed for Le Court-Pienaar to pull it off, but don’t be surprised if she goes into the race leader’s green jersey after Stage 2’s hilly finish on the Tess Valley coastline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although we’re a long way away from her Indian Ocean homeland, this year’s Tour of Britain Women will be somewhat of a home race for the AG Insurance-Soudal rider as her mother is Scottish, so she may be the local favourite once the race crosses the border on Stage 3.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-2-970x332.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-2-970x332.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-2-300x103.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-2-768x263.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-2-1536x526.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-2-2048x701.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-2-750x257.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-2-1140x390.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cat Ferguson (Movistar)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250509LVF1007-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250509LVF1007-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250509LVF1007-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250509LVF1007-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250509LVF1007-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250509LVF1007-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250509LVF1007-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250509LVF1007-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250509LVF1007-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250509LVF1007-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250509LVF1007-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Unipublic/Rafa Gómez/Sprint Cycling Agency</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Britain’s Cat Ferguson is rightfully considered to be one of the favourites for the Tour of Britain Women. The Movistar rider has enjoyed a breakout season on the pro level, having cracked the podium at the Trofeo Alfredo Binda in March, but more recently poaching a victory at the one-day Navarra Classic over in Spain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly the 19-year-old is in good form and is no stranger to rubbing shoulders with the WorldTour’s best. In that case, she should be one of the marked riders on Stage 2 with its sharp arrival into Saltburn-by-the-Sea. If any sprinters get dropped on Stage 3’s bumpy arrival into Kelso, then Ferguson may finally get her chance to taste WorldTour glory in her home race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ferguson will be Movistar’s leader. Thankfully, the team haven’t held back in supporting the youngster so far this year, and with the experienced pairing of Floortje Mackaij and Aude Biannic to steer her towards the head of affairs, we could be in for the Yorkshirewoman’s real announcement on the WorldTour stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cat-ferguson-interview-2025\">Q&amp;A

suggest that Lorena Wiebes is a favourite for the GC here. Knowing her sprinting ability, however, we have to work back on the assumption that she’s going to gain quite the cushion of bonus seconds through sprint victories and podium finishes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Realistically, Wiebes could win three out of the four stages. With the bonus seconds claimed there, she may have a 30-second buffer to play with on Stage 2’s uphill finish. We’ve seen the Dutch sprinter improve on her climbing in recent years. Of course, her win at Milan-San Remo comes to mind, but she’s also a former champion of the Amstel Gold Race too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To add, Wiebes has always gone well in the UK. She’s won 16 times in Britain, with six of those coming from Tour of Britain stages. Perhaps there’s something about our pothole-ridden roads that really clicks with the SD Worx powerhouse.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Kristen Faulkner (EF Education-Oatly)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0181-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0181-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0181-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0181-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0181-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0181-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0181-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0181-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0181-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0181-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0181-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBF0181-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Olympic champion Kristen Faulkner has had a quiet start to 2025. She prolonged her off-season and returned to racing in the midst of the Spring Classics. She didn’t light up the scoreboard there though, only managing a top 25 at Liège-Bastogne-Liège. These disappointments were soon overwritten by her US national title defence over in West Virginia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming into the Tour of Britain, just her second stage race of the year, it’s hard to tell how she’ll go. Her big name suggests a GC bid, but recent form may indicate that she’s not quite there yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, she is the type to launch a late move. It’s her signature, having displayed it on the biggest occasions, like the Vuelta and the Olympic Games. The winding finale to Stage 4 around Glasgow could provide her with a chance to fly off the front and show off her motor. If this is paired up with a solid stage to Saltburn, Faulkner may be able to hang about in the top ten overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Anna Henderson (Lidl-Trek)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-768-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-768-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-768-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-768-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-768-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-768-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-768-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-768-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-768-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-768-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-768-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Lidl-Trek-December-Denia-Web-RB-768-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Lidl-Trek</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hertfordshire-raised <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/anna-henderson-interview\">Anna Henderson</a> finished behind Lotte Kopecky last year to claim a second place overall in the 2024 edition. This year, she’ll be hoping for one better, and the chance to finally win her first WorldTour stage race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After switching teams in the winter to Lidl-Trek, Henderson has been in solid form. She finished inside the top ten at both Amstel Gold and the Brabantse Pijl before another decent Vuelta, where she scored a top ten finish on Stage 2. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Henderson will be familiar with Saltburn bank, having competed in the British Championships here over the past couple of years. To add, she’ll be anchored by the experienced Lizzie Deignan as well as <em>rouleur</em> Emma Norsgaard, the in-form Lauretta Hanson and Riejanne Markus, who could comfortably lead the team herself. As a collective, Lidl-Trek may be the strongest on the startlist.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sarah Van Dam (Ceratizit)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215351365-min-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215351365-min-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215351365-min-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215351365-min-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215351365-min-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215351365-min-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215351365-min-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215351365-min-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215351365-min-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215351365-min-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215351365-min-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215351365-min-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Szymon Gruchalski/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the breakout stars of 2025 has to be Canadian Sarah Van Dam. The youngster enjoyed an exceptional Spanish block of racing, culminating in a top three finish at Itzulia Basque Country. With her contract expiring at the end of the year, she’ll be hoping to attract the attention of some of the sport’s biggest teams. The Tour of Britain should, therefore, give her a decent chance to finally move onto the top step of the podium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the route may appear too flat for Van Dam, who is a bona fide climber, Stage 2’s steep finale to Saltburn Bank should have her name written all over it. There is a chance to go long on that stage, with several kickers on the menu – some of which offer the incentive of bonus seconds. If she plays her cards right here, she may be able to filter her opposition and build a serious advantage in the GC standings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With her current streak of form, Van Dam could be a good underdog to place a bet on. Given her team’s upward trajectory in results so far this year, don’t be surprised if Ceratizit try to disrupt the Lidl-Trek/SD Worx status quo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Letizia Paternoster (Jayco-AlUla)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250505LVF1006-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250505LVF1006-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250505LVF1006-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250505LVF1006-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250505LVF1006-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250505LVF1006-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250505LVF1006-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250505LVF1006-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250505LVF1006-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250505LVF1006-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250505LVF1006-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Unipublic/Rafa Gómez/Sprint Cycling Agency</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Leitizia Paternoster thought she won a stage at the Tour of Britain last year. On the opening day’s finale into Llandudno, she prematurely raised her arms, believing that she had pipped Lotte Kopecky to her first WorldTour victory in five years. Unlucky for her, the photo finish had a different conclusion, but the Italian would keep her spirits up and ride to a solid fifth place overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year Paternoster seems to be in equally convincing form. The Italian rode an incredibly consistent Classics campaign, finishing inside the top 25 at every one-day race she entered in the spring bar Milan-San Remo, which she pulled out of. Recently at the Vuelta, she displayed similar legs and managed to gain the race lead for a day. Based on these signs, the punchy sprinter could have a good shot at the GC again at the Tour of Britain Women.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stages 1 and 3 really suit Paternoster, and the uphill finish to Saltburn could go her way, but it would require a softer approach if she were to hang on. Otherwise, Ruby Roseman-Gannon, who won Stage 4 last year, is another name on the Jayco roster that you should be keeping an eye out for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tour of Britain Women 2025 full startlist</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><p><em>Data powered by <a href=\"https://firstcycling.com/race.php?r=9063&amp;y=2025&amp;k=8\" target=\"_blank\">FirstCycling.com</a></em></p></div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+2\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'get the magazine for people who love cycling, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-britain-women-2025-favourites\">Who are the favourites for the Tour of Britain Women 2025?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"8c5264f9c1f33e8ca90c2fbb59a37b28a8c82dbd69c657c5ce6e78dede49b394","category":"Cycling"}
