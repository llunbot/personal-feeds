(This is not the case with Apple devices).</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Independent repair shops should not be required to report customers' personally identifiable information to the manufacturer.</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nIn France, Right to Repair laws require manufacturers to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/26/apple-rolls-out-device-repairability-scores-france/\">provide a device repairability score</a> that gives context on how difficult or easy it is to repair, and iFixit says that the FTC should adopt a similar policy in the United States.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Consider this a request for the FTC to stretch its arm out,\" reads <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/News/86420/were-calling-on-the-ftc-to-restore-our-right-to-repair\">iFixit's blog post on the petition</a>. The site acknowledges that developing and enforcing any kind of rule could take years, but it is hopeful that the FTC will consider the request.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple in August supported <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/california-right-to-repair-law/\">California's Right to Repair law</a>, drawing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/23/apple-supports-right-to-repair-in-california/\">praise from iFixit</a>, but there is no equivalent federal right to repair mandate at this time. Apple in October endorsed a push for nationwide <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-expanding-device-repair-programs/\">Right to Repair law</a> that \"balances repairability with product integrity, usability, and physical safety.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple was supportive of California's law in particular because it requires parts to be sourced from the manufacturer, and it does not allow for parts from third-party sources. Notably, California's law does not have some of the specific provisions that iFixit is proposing, such the option to swap components from two identical devices or the option to conduct repairs without tying components to a device's IMEI.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile iFixit has lauded Apple for backing California's Right to Repair law, the site in September <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/19/ifixit-lowers-iphone-14-repairability-score/\">lowered the iPhone 14's repairability score</a> from a 7/10 to a 4/10 because of the way that Apple ties repair components to a specific device by requiring validation.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ifixit/\">iFixit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/right-to-repair/\">Right to Repair</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/ifixit-ftc-right-to-repair-rules/\">iFixit Urges FTC to Establish Stronger Right to Repair Rules</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixit-urges-ftc-to-establish-stronger-right-to-repair-rules.2410982/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"102af554d1cd319e8be41fe81b7d2bde379bd7b07d189e81648b6915753cabd0","category":"Apple"}
