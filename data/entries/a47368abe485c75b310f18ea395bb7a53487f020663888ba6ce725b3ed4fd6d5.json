In September, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/apple-working-to-fix-ipados-18-m4-ipad-pro-issue/\">pulled iPadOS 18 for iPad Pro models with the M4 chip</a> after the update prevented some of those devices from working, and it also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/24/apple-pulls-homepod-18-1-beta-2/\">pulled HomePod software 18.1 beta 2</a> after that beta caused some HomePod speakers to stop working.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile two out of three of these problematic releases were betas, which are meant to catch these sort of issues, this is still an unfortunate stretch for Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will likely make a new build of watchOS 11.1 beta 3 available in the coming days, or it might simply move on to watchOS 11.1 beta 4.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch 10</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/apple-pulls-third-software-update-in-past-month/\">Apple Pulls Third Software Update in Past Month Due to Issues</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pulls-third-software-update-in-past-month-due-to-issues.2439016/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a47368abe485c75b310f18ea395bb7a53487f020663888ba6ce725b3ed4fd6d5","category":"Apple"}
