Read on for all the details on this week's biggest stories!\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Everything New in iOS 17 Beta 3</h2>\r<br />\nApple this week seeded the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/05/apple-seeds-ios-17-beta-3-to-developers/\">third beta of iOS 17</a> to developers for testing. The latest beta includes a few smaller changes for the iPhone, so be sure to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/everything-new-ios-17-beta-3/\">check out our recap of everything new</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/General-iOS-17-Feature-Blue-Green.jpg\" alt width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nThe first public beta of iOS 17 will be available later this month, according to Apple, and the software update will be released for all users with an iPhone XS and newer in September. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">Read our in-depth iOS 17 roundup</a> to learn more about the update and new features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also released the third developer betas of iPadOS 17, macOS Sonoma, watchOS 10, and tvOS 17 this week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone 15 Pro Expected to Come in Blue</h2>\r<br />\nThe iPhone 15 Pro models set to be introduced this September will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/07/iphone-15-pro-blue/\">available in a unique dark blue color</a> that has a gray tone, according to leaker Unknownz21.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Blue-Perspective-2.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nAvailable in a new titanium material, the blue shade will have a brushed finish that is unlike the stainless steel Apple has used in the past. The color is similar to the blue Apple used for the iPhone 12 Pro models, but it appears to be darker and with more gray to better complement the titanium finish. Check out our article for renderings we created to demonstrate the new color. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone 15 Pro Max Predicted to Be More Expensive Than Previous Model</h2>\r<br />\nThe high-end <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/06/iphone-15-pro-max-more-expensive/\">iPhone 15 Pro Max will be more expensive than the iPhone 14 Pro Max</a>, which starts at $1,099, according to tech analyst Jeff Pu.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/iPhone-15-Pro-Blue-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nOne reason the Pro Max might be more expensive this year is the device's rumored periscope lens, which is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/iphone-15-pro-max-5-6x-optical-zoom/\">expected to enable up to 5-6x optical zoom</a>, compared to the current limit of 3x.
