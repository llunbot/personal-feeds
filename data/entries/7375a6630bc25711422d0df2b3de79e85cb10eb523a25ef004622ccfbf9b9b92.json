China has a huge number of state-owned enterprises in power generation, seaport construction, mining, manufacturing, education, and investment markets. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeanwhile, Huawei's comeback is predicted to continue, with the Chinese company continuing to develop and extend its own operating system, HarmonyOS, designed to rival iOS and Android.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/huawei/\">Huawei</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/iphone-sales-down-huawei-resurgence-china/\">China iPhone Sales Likely to Continue Losing Ground to Huawei in 2024</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/china-iphone-sales-likely-to-continue-losing-ground-to-huawei-in-2024.2415740/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7375a6630bc25711422d0df2b3de79e85cb10eb523a25ef004622ccfbf9b9b92","category":"Apple"}
