These instances are powered by custom Intel Xeon 6 processors with a sustained all-core turbo frequency of 3.9 GHz, available only on AWS. These SAP certified instances deliver the highest performance and fastest memory bandwidth among comparable Intel processors in the cloud.</p> \n<p>X8i instances are ideal for memory-intensive workloads including in-memory databases such as SAP HANA, traditional large-scale databases, data analytics, and electronic design automation (EDA), which require high compute performance and a large memory footprint.</p> \n<p>These instances provide 1.5 times more memory capacity (up to 6 TB), and 3.3 times more memory bandwidth compared to previous generation <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ko/ec2/instance-types/x2i/?trk=d8ec3b19-0f37-4f8c-8c12-189f913e205c&amp;sc_channel=el\">X2i instances</a>. These instances offer up to 43% higher performance compared to X2i instances, with higher gains on some of the real-world workloads. They deliver up to 50% higher SAP Application Performance Standard (SAPS) performance, up to 47% faster PostgreSQL performance, up to 88% faster Memcached performance, and up to 46% faster AI inference performance.</p> \n<p>During the preview, customers like <a href=\"https://www.sap.com/products/erp/rise.html\">RISE with SAP</a> utilized up to 6 TB of memory capacity with 50% higher compute performance compared to X2i instances. This enabled faster transaction processing and improved query response times for SAP HANA workloads. <a href=\"https://orion.com/\">Orion</a> reduced the number of active cores on X8i instances compared to X2idn instances while maintaining performance thresholds, cutting SQL Server licensing costs by 50%.</p> \n<p><strong><u>X8i instances</u></strong><br /> X8i instances are available in 14 sizes including three larger instance sizes (<strong>48xlarge</strong>, <strong>64xlarge</strong>, and <strong>96xlarge</strong>), so you can choose the right size for your application to scale up, and two bare metal sizes (<strong>metal-48xl</strong> and <strong>metal-96xl</strong>) to deploy workloads that benefit from direct access to physical resources. X8i instances feature up to 100 Gbps of network bandwidth with support for the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/efa/?trk=d8ec3b19-0f37-4f8c-8c12-189f913e205c&amp;sc_channel=el\">Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)</a> and up to 80 Gbps of throughput to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/?trk=d8ec3b19-0f37-4f8c-8c12-189f913e205c&amp;sc_channel=el\">Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)</a>.</p> \n<p>Here are the specs for X8i instances:</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>Instance name</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>vCPUs</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Memory<br /> </strong><strong>(GiB)</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Network bandwidth (Gbps)</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>EBS bandwidth (Gbps)</strong></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>x8i.large</strong></td> \n   <td>2</td> \n   <td>32</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>x8i.xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>4</td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>x8i.2xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>8</td> \n   <td>128</td> \n   <td>Up to 15</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>x8i.4xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>16</td> \n   <td>256</td> \n   <td>Up to 15</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>x8i.8xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>32</td> \n   <td>512</td> \n   <td>15</td> \n   <td>10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>x8i.12xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>48</td> \n   <td>768</td> \n   <td>22.5</td> \n   <td>15</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>x8i.16xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>1,024</td> \n   <td>30</td> \n   <td>20</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>x8i.24xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>96</td> \n   <td>1,536</td> \n   <td>40</td> \n   <td>30</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>x8i.32xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>128</td> \n   <td>2,048</td> \n   <td>50</td> \n   <td>40</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>x8i.48xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>192</td> \n   <td>3,072</td> \n   <td>75</td> \n   <td>60</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>x8i.64xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>256</td> \n   <td>4,096</td> \n   <td>80</td> \n   <td>70</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>x8i.96xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>384</td> \n   <td>6,144</td> \n   <td>100</td> \n   <td>80</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>x8i.metal-48xl</strong></td> \n   <td>192</td> \n   <td>3,072</td> \n   <td>75</td> \n   <td>60</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>x8i.metal-96xl</strong></td> \n   <td>384</td> \n   <td>6,144</td> \n   <td>100</td> \n   <td>80</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>X8i instances support the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/instance-bandwidth-configuration.html?trk=d8ec3b19-0f37-4f8c-8c12-189f913e205c&amp;sc_channel=el\">instance bandwidth configuration (IBC)</a> feature like other eighth-generation instance types, offering flexibility to allocate resources between network and EBS bandwidth.
