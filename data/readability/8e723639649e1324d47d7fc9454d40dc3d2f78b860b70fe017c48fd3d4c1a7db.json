The fit is incredibly dialed in thanks to three closures on the upper plus a heel retention system. You can make easy adjustments in-ride if your feet start to swell, and despite the stiff sole, these shoes feel more comfortable than most.</p><p>This women’s version of the Wire 2 has a lower overall volume and tapers to fit a woman’s foot more accurately.

We tend to dislike both of those closure styles since neither is reliable. (See the FAQ section below for more on that.) So we’re fans of spending a little more upfront to get a better closure system, like Pearl Izumi Sugar Road’s laces.</p><p>Laces make these shoes much easier to adjust to your foot’s exact shape and size and avoid any failures during the ride. And unlike velcro, they won’t degrade over time. These shoes are also incredibly breathable, thanks to their visibly perforated upper.</p><p>At <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=b5770911-39dc-46ac-ba0f-b49dbb30c5c7&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fpearl-izumi-sugar-road-cycling-shoe-womens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$130</a>, it’s impressive that Pearl Izumi has created a stiff nylon sole with a carbon fiber plate.

We also like the look, and the durability of the custom CNC machined alloy Boa dials. We’re also impressed with the weight: At 224 grams for a size 42, it puts them among the lightest options on the market.</p><p>We love that these come in a huge range of sizes. They’re available in narrow, wide and regular widths and come in Euro sizes from 36 to 49. If you’re ordering online, consider ordering a couple of different options unless you’re positive about your sizing, and then keep the ones that fit the best.

With a women-specific fit and a medium-stiffness nylon and glass composite sole, they’ll be comfortable enough to get you started.</p><p>We don’t love the three Velcro-style straps since they’re harder to make small adjustments to and will wear out over time. While these shoes will serve you well, if you are in this ultra-budget category and have any offroad bikes as well, we would recommend considering mountain bike shoes and pedals for all of your bikes. Having a single set of pedals and shoes to maintain will allow you to spend a bit more on one pair of higher-end shoes with a better closure system.</p><p>Ultimately, if you’re set on having a pair of road shoes, these are the best option for strict budgets.</p><ul><li>Closure system:&nbsp;Velcro straps</li><li>Sole: Glass fiber reinforced nylon</li><li>Weight:&nbsp;222 grams for size 40</li><li>Sizes:&nbsp;36-44 Euro</li><li>Colors: Black, blue</li><li>MSRP: $90</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Solid budget shoe option<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Strap system isn’t ideal<br></p><div id=\"attachment_268531\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084017/giro-best-womens-road-shoes-2.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-268531\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084017/giro-best-womens-road-shoes-2.jpg\" alt=\"Best women's road shoes: Giro Empire\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084017/giro-best-womens-road-shoes-2.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084017/giro-best-womens-road-shoes-2-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084017/giro-best-womens-road-shoes-2-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084017/giro-best-womens-road-shoes-2-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084017/giro-best-womens-road-shoes-2-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084017/giro-best-womens-road-shoes-2-1536x1023.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084017/giro-best-womens-road-shoes-2-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084017/giro-best-womens-road-shoes-2-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084017/giro-best-womens-road-shoes-2-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084017/giro-best-womens-road-shoes-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084017/giro-best-womens-road-shoes-2.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084017/giro-best-womens-road-shoes-2-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084017/giro-best-womens-road-shoes-2-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084017/giro-best-womens-road-shoes-2-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084017/giro-best-womens-road-shoes-2-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084017/giro-best-womens-road-shoes-2-1536x1023.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084017/giro-best-womens-road-shoes-2-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084017/giro-best-womens-road-shoes-2-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084017/giro-best-womens-road-shoes-2-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-268531\">c. Giro<span>&nbsp;</span></p></div><h2>Best Women’s Road Bike Shoes Buyer’s Guide</h2><p><strong>Decide on how you want to ride and what features you care about.</strong> Are you planning to do really long rides on the road? You may value comfort over a lighter weight, and you might prefer a less stiff sole if you’ll be walking into coffee shops along your route. If you’re the local crit champion (or hoping to be), then you may want the benefits that a stiff sole can provide, and saving grams may be important.</p><p><strong>Determine your price point.</strong> While all of the shoes in this list are our personal favorites, many big brands like Shimano, Specialized, and Bontrager will have a range of shoes at various price points where the technologies remain similar, but the materials differ. And, mostly, the fit should be similar up and down each brand’s range as they (again, mostly) use the same lasts for every model.</p><p>At the higher end, shoes will be lighter and stiffer, but the cheaper models will still have many of the same great innovations. Specialized has the S7 that we love, but the Torch collection is also great and offers three models ranging from $110 to $225 in price.</p><p><strong>Measure your feet carefully.</strong> Bike shoes will fit slightly differently than regular shoes, and most brands will list some sizing specifications or provide size charts. Most bike shoes are designed with Euro sizing in mind; then, US shoe size values are assigned. Not every brand does those calculations the same, so the European measurement is almost always more accurate.</p><p>Check the size on other cycling shoes you’ve had in the past as a reference, rather than your regular sneakers. Between sizes? If you are shopping online and the retailer offers free returns, buy both pairs so you can try them on and compare them, then send one pair back.</p><p>And because many brands make men’s and women’s models of the same shoe, make sure that if you are buying based on US size, you know whether you’re buying it in men’s or women’s sizing. For instance, Specialized S7 comes in men’s and women’s models, and it’s easy to navigate over to the men’s accidentally. The fit won’t change much, but the sizing will differ.</p><div id=\"attachment_182002\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Quoc-Night-carbon-sole-road-bike-shoe_wider-small-size-range.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-182002\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Quoc-Night-carbon-sole-road-bike-shoe_wider-small-size-range.jpg\" alt=\"best women's road bike shoes and thin socks\" width=\"1100\" height=\"733\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Quoc-Night-carbon-sole-road-bike-shoe_wider-small-size-range.jpg 1100w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Quoc-Night-carbon-sole-road-bike-shoe_wider-small-size-range-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Quoc-Night-carbon-sole-road-bike-shoe_wider-small-size-range-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Quoc-Night-carbon-sole-road-bike-shoe_wider-small-size-range-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Quoc-Night-carbon-sole-road-bike-shoe_wider-small-size-range-600x400.jpg 600w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Quoc-Night-carbon-sole-road-bike-shoe_wider-small-size-range-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Quoc-Night-carbon-sole-road-bike-shoe_wider-small-size-range-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Quoc-Night-carbon-sole-road-bike-shoe_wider-small-size-range-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Quoc-Night-carbon-sole-road-bike-shoe_wider-small-size-range.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Quoc-Night-carbon-sole-road-bike-shoe_wider-small-size-range.jpg 1100w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Quoc-Night-carbon-sole-road-bike-shoe_wider-small-size-range-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Quoc-Night-carbon-sole-road-bike-shoe_wider-small-size-range-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Quoc-Night-carbon-sole-road-bike-shoe_wider-small-size-range-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Quoc-Night-carbon-sole-road-bike-shoe_wider-small-size-range-600x400.jpg 600w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Quoc-Night-carbon-sole-road-bike-shoe_wider-small-size-range-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Quoc-Night-carbon-sole-road-bike-shoe_wider-small-size-range-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Quoc-Night-carbon-sole-road-bike-shoe_wider-small-size-range-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-182002\">Note the cycling socks—they tend to be thinner than casual everyday socks. c.

Road shoes are designed to be lighter, more aerodynamic, and generally a bit stiffer than shoes for other cycling disciplines.</p><p>You can also use those same shoes when riding indoors on a stationary bike that’s set up with your road pedals. What you don’t want to do is use those road pedals when riding anything off-road. That means no road pedals for cyclocross or mountain bikes, and if your gravel rides tend to include sections where you need to unclip or walk, we suggest switching to MTB shoes and pedals.</p><div id=\"attachment_268532\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084103/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-6.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-268532\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084103/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-6.jpg\" alt=\"Pearl Izumi cycling shoes\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084103/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-6.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084103/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-6-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084103/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-6-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084103/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-6-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084103/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-6-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084103/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-6-1536x1023.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084103/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-6-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084103/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-6-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084103/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-6-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084103/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084103/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-6.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084103/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-6-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084103/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-6-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084103/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-6-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084103/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-6-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084103/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-6-1536x1023.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084103/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-6-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084103/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-6-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084103/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-6-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-268532\">c. Pearl Izumi</p></div><p><strong>When would I need clipless pedals versus riding with cages or flat pedals?</strong><br>You’ll lose less power in the transfer from your foot to the pedal when you’re connected, allowing you to go much faster with less effort. Flat pedals allow much less assistance on the “up” side and across the top and bottom of your pedal stroke, meaning your downstroke is the only thing propelling you forward, so it’s much less efficient. Cages, which can be used with regular running shoes, will help with this a bit, but can be tough to get in and out of, won’t be aerodynamic, and still won’t have the same efficiency as clipless road pedals and shoes.</p><p><strong>What pedals should I get?</strong><br>There are dozens of road pedals to choose from, but the most popular are the Look Keo, Shimano SPD (make sure you get the <a href=\"https://bike.shimano.com/en-US/information/news/choosing-the-right-shimano-spd-sl-road-cleat-for-you.html\">SPD-SL road version,</a> not the SPD MTB version!) and Speedplays. There are different pedal options in those ranges, but the goods news is that a Look Keo cleat will work with any iteration of Look Keo pedals.</p><p><strong>Do I need women-specific shoes?</strong><br>Generally, women are just fine in unisex or men’s models of road shoes. But you may find that you prefer a women-specific shoe if you have narrower feet or higher arches. Still, there usually isn’t a major difference other than the colorways.</p><p><strong>How should a women’s road bike shoe fit?</strong><br>You don’t need to move your foot much in a road shoe, so while they should feel comfortable, they’ll often feel a little tighter than a running shoe. You should be able to wiggle your toes slightly, though. And you should be able to adjust them to accommodate any swelling or expansion once you’ve been riding for a while, either by loosening the Boa dials, laces, or straps.</p><p>There shouldn’t be any pressure points on the sides or tops of your feet once you’ve tightened the straps or laces appropriately. If you find that your feet are going numb on most rides, your shoes may not fit properly. Walking might be a bit uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giro-Regime-high-performance-road-shoes-at-a-mid-level-pricecarbon-coposite-sole.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giro-Regime-high-performance-road-shoes-at-a-mid-level-pricecarbon-coposite-sole.jpg\" alt=\"Giro Regime high performance road shoes at a mid-level price, carbon composite sole\" width=\"1600\" height=\"630\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giro-Regime-high-performance-road-shoes-at-a-mid-level-pricecarbon-coposite-sole.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giro-Regime-high-performance-road-shoes-at-a-mid-level-pricecarbon-coposite-sole-297x117.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giro-Regime-high-performance-road-shoes-at-a-mid-level-pricecarbon-coposite-sole-800x315.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giro-Regime-high-performance-road-shoes-at-a-mid-level-pricecarbon-coposite-sole-120x47.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giro-Regime-high-performance-road-shoes-at-a-mid-level-pricecarbon-coposite-sole-768x302.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giro-Regime-high-performance-road-shoes-at-a-mid-level-pricecarbon-coposite-sole-1536x605.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giro-Regime-high-performance-road-shoes-at-a-mid-level-pricecarbon-coposite-sole-696x274.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giro-Regime-high-performance-road-shoes-at-a-mid-level-pricecarbon-coposite-sole-1068x421.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giro-Regime-high-performance-road-shoes-at-a-mid-level-pricecarbon-coposite-sole-1067x420.jpg 1067w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giro-Regime-high-performance-road-shoes-at-a-mid-level-pricecarbon-coposite-sole.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giro-Regime-high-performance-road-shoes-at-a-mid-level-pricecarbon-coposite-sole.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giro-Regime-high-performance-road-shoes-at-a-mid-level-pricecarbon-coposite-sole-297x117.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giro-Regime-high-performance-road-shoes-at-a-mid-level-pricecarbon-coposite-sole-800x315.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giro-Regime-high-performance-road-shoes-at-a-mid-level-pricecarbon-coposite-sole-120x47.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giro-Regime-high-performance-road-shoes-at-a-mid-level-pricecarbon-coposite-sole-768x302.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giro-Regime-high-performance-road-shoes-at-a-mid-level-pricecarbon-coposite-sole-1536x605.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giro-Regime-high-performance-road-shoes-at-a-mid-level-pricecarbon-coposite-sole-696x274.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giro-Regime-high-performance-road-shoes-at-a-mid-level-pricecarbon-coposite-sole-1068x421.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giro-Regime-high-performance-road-shoes-at-a-mid-level-pricecarbon-coposite-sole-1067x420.jpg 1067w\"></a></p><p><strong>Do I need carbon soles?</strong><br>Road shoes will have either a carbon, nylon or plastic sole (or a combination, with some companies blending glass fibers in as well). You don’t need them, but yes, carbon soles can make you a little speedier.</p><p>That’s because a carbon sole adds stiffness while also making a shoe more lightweight. The stiffer the sole, the less power is lost transferring force from your leg to your pedal. And of course, weight weenies will prefer carbon simply because you shed a few grams.</p><p>If you’re on a&nbsp; budget, don’t despair. Nylon or plastic soles will be more comfortable, and you won’t lose more than a few watts. Plus, if you’re not used to ultra-stiff soles, a tiny bit of flex might actually feel better as you get into the sport.</p><p><strong>Can I use mountain bike shoes as women’s road bike shoes?</strong><br>Absolutely.</p><p><strong>Can I use road shoes as MTB shoes?</strong><br>Please don’t.</p><div id=\"attachment_216937\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rapha-Classic-road-shoes_carbon-soled-3-bolt-road-bike-cycling-shoes_on-bike.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-216937\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rapha-Classic-road-shoes_carbon-soled-3-bolt-road-bike-cycling-shoes_on-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Rapha Classic shoes, carbon-soled road &amp; light gravel bike riding shoes\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rapha-Classic-road-shoes_carbon-soled-3-bolt-road-bike-cycling-shoes_on-bike.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rapha-Classic-road-shoes_carbon-soled-3-bolt-road-bike-cycling-shoes_on-bike-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rapha-Classic-road-shoes_carbon-soled-3-bolt-road-bike-cycling-shoes_on-bike-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rapha-Classic-road-shoes_carbon-soled-3-bolt-road-bike-cycling-shoes_on-bike-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rapha-Classic-road-shoes_carbon-soled-3-bolt-road-bike-cycling-shoes_on-bike-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rapha-Classic-road-shoes_carbon-soled-3-bolt-road-bike-cycling-shoes_on-bike-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rapha-Classic-road-shoes_carbon-soled-3-bolt-road-bike-cycling-shoes_on-bike-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rapha-Classic-road-shoes_carbon-soled-3-bolt-road-bike-cycling-shoes_on-bike-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rapha-Classic-road-shoes_carbon-soled-3-bolt-road-bike-cycling-shoes_on-bike.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rapha-Classic-road-shoes_carbon-soled-3-bolt-road-bike-cycling-shoes_on-bike.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rapha-Classic-road-shoes_carbon-soled-3-bolt-road-bike-cycling-shoes_on-bike-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rapha-Classic-road-shoes_carbon-soled-3-bolt-road-bike-cycling-shoes_on-bike-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rapha-Classic-road-shoes_carbon-soled-3-bolt-road-bike-cycling-shoes_on-bike-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rapha-Classic-road-shoes_carbon-soled-3-bolt-road-bike-cycling-shoes_on-bike-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rapha-Classic-road-shoes_carbon-soled-3-bolt-road-bike-cycling-shoes_on-bike-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rapha-Classic-road-shoes_carbon-soled-3-bolt-road-bike-cycling-shoes_on-bike-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rapha-Classic-road-shoes_carbon-soled-3-bolt-road-bike-cycling-shoes_on-bike-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-216937\">c. Cory</p></div><p><strong>When should I replace my road cleats?</strong><br>If you notice that your foot is wiggling slightly in the pedal, or you suddenly start clipping out unintentionally during rides, it’s time to replace your cleats. Difficulty getting out of the pedals is also a sign. The plastic or metal edges wear out over time and aren’t meant to last as long as your pedals.</p><p><strong>What’s the best closure system for women’s road bike shoes?</strong><br>We like a combination of closures to avoid catastrophic shoe failures. Also, two or more closures are great for small adjustments to avoid pressure points. That might be two independent Boa dials or a Boa with a strap. Some shoes like Giro opt for regular laces, which are great since even if they break, you can still get them tied up enough to get home. And while they take a bit more time and effort to adjust, laces are great for getting the perfect fit.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084150/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084150/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084150/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-1.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084150/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084150/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-1-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084150/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084150/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-1-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084150/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-1-1536x1023.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084150/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-1-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084150/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084150/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-1-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084150/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084150/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-1.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084150/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084150/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-1-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084150/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084150/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-1-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084150/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-1-1536x1023.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084150/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-1-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084150/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18084150/pearl-izumi-best-womens-road-shoes-1-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>Have more questions?
