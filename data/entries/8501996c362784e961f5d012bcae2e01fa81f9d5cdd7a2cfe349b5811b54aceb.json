The MacBook shortage is related to a lack of power management integrated circuits, a problem similar to the one that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models also now appear to be facing.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe continuing chip shortages are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/15/apple-supplier-tsmc-chip-shortage-2022/\">expected to last</a> well into 2022, and while Apple is facing supply issues due to the problem, it has been one of the least affected companies in 2021. Other tech companies are also dealing with component shortages, which have been driving prices higher.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13\">iPhone 13 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13-Pro\">iPhone 13 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/12/apple-iphone-production-cuts-chip-shortages/\">Apple to Cut iPhone Production Goals by as Many as 10 Million Units Due to Chip Shortages</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-cut-iphone-production-goals-by-as-many-as-10-million-units-due-to-chip-shortages.2316650/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1lvv4MgiMqg:CWkQunrEYxE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1lvv4MgiMqg:CWkQunrEYxE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/1lvv4MgiMqg\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8501996c362784e961f5d012bcae2e01fa81f9d5cdd7a2cfe349b5811b54aceb","category":"Apple"}
