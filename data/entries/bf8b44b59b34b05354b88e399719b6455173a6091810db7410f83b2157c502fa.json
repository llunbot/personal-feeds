It has longer and more detailed titles, multiple artists for each work, and hundreds of recordings of well-known pieces. The Apple Music Classical app is designed to support the complex data structure of classical music.</blockquote>Apple offers a longer explanation on a new <a href=\"https://learn.applemusic.apple/apple-music-classical\">Apple Music Classical page</a>:<blockquote>Classical music often involves multiple musicians recording works that have been recorded many times before and are referred to by different names. For example, from the formal Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 14 to the popular byname of Moonlight Sonata, or in multiple languages, such as Mondschein Sonata in German. Such complexities mean that classical music fans have been ill-served by streaming platforms. Until now. A distinct app, included with an Apple Music subscription, gives these classical music lovers the editorial and catalog content they've been missing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOnly a brand-new app — with specialized features and a beautiful interface designed for the genre — could remove the complexity and make classical music easily searchable, browsable, and accessible for beginners and experts alike.</blockquote>The support document provides answers to some other frequently asked questions about the app, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/27/apple-music-classical-begins-rolling-out/\">began rolling out today</a>. Much of the information relates to how the Apple Music Classical app integrates with the standard Apple Music app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also shared a video overview of the app on YouTube:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nApple Music Classical offers over five million classical music tracks and is free to use with a standard Apple Music subscription on iOS 15.4 and later. The app is based on Primephonic, a classical music streaming service that Apple acquired in 2021. The app is available for the iPhone only at launch, with an Android version coming soon.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music-classical/\">Apple Music Classical</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/27/why-apple-music-classical-launched/\">Apple Explains Why It Launched an iPhone App Dedicated to Classical Music</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-explains-why-it-launched-an-iphone-app-dedicated-to-classical-music.2385022/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bf8b44b59b34b05354b88e399719b6455173a6091810db7410f83b2157c502fa","category":"Apple"}
