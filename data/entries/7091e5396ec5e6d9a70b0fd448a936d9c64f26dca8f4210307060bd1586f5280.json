When installed behind vintage thumbies or bar-end shifters, they will remove cable slop and greatly improve shifting feel, as most olde-tyme derailleurs never came with adjusting barrels, i.e., early Huret, Campagnolo, most Suntour, some Shimano, etc.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-49.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-49.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-49.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/1983-Steve-Potts-Dirt-Drop-49.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/1983-steve-potts-dirt-drop/\" target=\"_blank\">WTB and others produced these in the 1980s and early 1990s</a>, but in case you didn’t notice, that was decades ago, so availability is not great. We do know about a few modern solutions, all of which look really dumb on a Prewar Klunk, an ’85 Commando, or a ’91 Jellybean. So House of Looptail made These Things™ to be functional yet understated and to look like they might actually belong on your vintage bicycle.</p>\n<p>Check out more at <a href=\"https://www.houseoflooptail.com/store/p/style-03-g2rtt-lr2bz\" target=\"_blank\">House of Looptail</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/house-of-looptail-these-things-in-line-barrel-adjusters/\">House of Looptail These Things Vintage Inspired In-Line Barrel Adjusters</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"7091e5396ec5e6d9a70b0fd448a936d9c64f26dca8f4210307060bd1586f5280","category":"Cycling"}
