If approved, the settlement fund will be divided equally among the class members based on the number of refurbished replacement devices they received, according to the court documents.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt is anticipated that the class will receive a total of between $63.4 million and $68.1 million once attorneys' fees and other costs have been deducted, per the proposed settlement terms. If the settlement is approved, details will be available at <a href=\"https://replacementdevicelawsuit.com/\">ReplacementDeviceLawsuit.com</a>, and class members will also be contacted by email or mail if possible.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple \"vigorously denied\" that refurbished devices are inferior, but it opted to settle with the plaintiffs given the time and costs that would be associated with a continued trial, according to the court documents. Plaintiffs are seeking court approval on October 20 or as soon thereafter as the matter may be heard by the judge presiding over the case.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe case, Maldonado et al v. Apple, Inc et al, was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/07/20/applecare-class-action-lawsuit/\">first filed in July 2016</a> in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/\">lawsuit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/\">Apple refurbished products</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/04/apple-refurbished-lawsuit-settlement/\">Apple Agrees to Pay $95 Million to Settle Lawsuit Claiming Refurbished Devices Aren't 'Equivalent to New'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-agrees-to-pay-95-million-to-settle-lawsuit-claiming-refurbished-devices-arent-equivalent-to-new.2315429/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=SmJdG-YM3OY:aQyKbUj48J4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=SmJdG-YM3OY:aQyKbUj48J4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/SmJdG-YM3OY\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ab8e7836d041d5858d1477489418d4327511f7e3517a13f0c64126d40c609b1b","category":"Apple"}
