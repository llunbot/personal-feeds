The road season is well and truly heating up, with a solo breakaway from Team DSM’s Pfeiffer Georgi at Brugge-De Panne resulting in her first WorldTour victory and Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) winning the men’s Brugge-De Panne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that wasn’t enough, Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma), Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) and Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates) broke clear at the E3 Saxo Classic. After some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MatMitchell30/status/1639291042473099267?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">chain lube controversy</a>, Van Aert beat his rivals in a three-man sprint. He distanced the peloton once more at Gent-Wevelgem, albeit with teammate and eventual winner Christophe Laporte, in another show of Jumbo-Visma dominance this season. It’s March.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marlen Reusser (SD Worx) won the women’s Gent-Wevelgem, becoming the first Swiss victor of the race, but it was perhaps not as straightforward as she would’ve liked after she took a wrong turn in the final kilometres while leading solo. Fortunately, she still had a large gap over the chasers and ended up winning by over two and a half minutes. We haven’t even begun to talk about Volta a Catalunya, where Primož Roglič secured the general classification…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1.

Van Aert’s mastery aside, Roglič held off a strong challenge from Soudal-QuickStep’s Remco Evenepoel over the seven-stage <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/volta-a-catalunya-preview\" target=\"_blank\">Volta a Catalunya</a>. Their positions on GC since Roglič’s victory on the first day – when Evenepoel placed second in the rainbow jersey – never changed. Both riders went on to win two stages each, with Roglič topping the field in both the overall and points classifications and Evenepoel securing both the climber and youth jerseys.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><p><em>Results powered by <a href=\"https://firstcycling.com/race.php?r=14&amp;y=2023\" target=\"_blank\">FirstCycling.com</a></em></p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Roglič and Evenepoel will both compete in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia</a> this year. Initial markers have been laid, and we could be in for some great action across <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\" target=\"_blank\">three weeks in May</a>, with a route that includes a Stage 20 mountain time-trial.

Merckx claimed he ‘would not have done it’ and Boonen said Van Aert ‘is going to regret it’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Aert and Laporte broke away from the field in the last 50km of Sunday’s race. Laporte told media afterwards that Van Aert had asked if he wanted to win with 10km to go, so the duo celebrated together before the Frenchman crossed the line first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally believe there are ‘no gifts in cycling’ and understand people wanting the winner of Gent-Wevelgem to be decided through a sprint finish. I also realise the significance of Van Aert, who won Gent-Wevelgem in 2021, allowing Laporte to take the day’s honours as a loyal teammate. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em><strong>Visit our hub page for more <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/classics\" target=\"_blank\">2023 Classics</a> coverage </strong></em></li></ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/wout-van-aert-2022-tour-de-france\">When does a name become a superlative?

Since his move to the team for the 2023 season, Mark Cavendish has continued to sport his signature Oakley sunglasses due to his personal deal with the brand, and some teammates followed suit. Naturally, it hasn’t gone down well with Scicon, who pulled its entire sponsorship deal including luggage and bike bags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scicon CEO Heinrich Dannhauser said, ‘It is unfortunate that individual riders can compromise sponsorship agreements in this way,’ and went on to question Astana’s ethics.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/scicon-astana-cavendish\" target=\"_blank\">Scicon cuts ties with Astana over Mark Cavendish’s sunglasses</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tour of Flanders is this weekend, and you can prepare for the action with our handy <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-flanders-route-riders-sportive-and-all-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">guide to the races</a>.
