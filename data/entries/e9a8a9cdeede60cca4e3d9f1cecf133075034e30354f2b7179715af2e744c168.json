Meanwhile, Apple's foldable iPhone will reportedly have a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/foldable-iphone-two-key-advantages/\">major focus on the hinge area that aims to set the device apart from existing foldable phones</a>, delivering higher-quality hinge materials that will help make the crease where the screen folds nearly invisible.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Video Review: Two Months With the M4 MacBook Air</h2>\r<br />\nIt's been nearly two months since the M4 MacBook Air launched, so we <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/07/m4-macbook-air-two-month-review/\">thought we'd take another look at the machine</a> now that it's been out long enough to do some serious testing with it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/M4-Air-1-Month-Later-Thumb-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" />\r<br />\nIntroduced in March, the ‌MacBook Air‌ is equipped with Apple's latest and greatest M4 chip, so it's more than capable of handling day-to-day tasks from web browsing and watching videos to getting work done. It's even powerful enough for photo editing and some light video editing work.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/07/m4-macbook-air-two-month-review/\">Check out Dan's full video</a> for an overview of how he's been using it and how it's been performing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>20th-Anniversary iPhone Will Reportedly Feature an All-Screen Design</h2>\r<br />\nWhile next year's iPhone 18 Pro models will reportedly reduce the front display cutout to a small pinhole for the camera, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/20th-anniversary-iphone-all-screen-report/\">2027's 20th-anniversary iPhone may finally see Apple move to an all-screen design</a> with even the camera moving underneath the display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/Beyond-iPhone-13-Better-Blue-Face-ID.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThat late 2027 iPhone release cycle may also see an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/kuo-apple-launch-iphone-19-air-larger-display-2027/\">\"iPhone 19 Air\" with a larger screen size</a> than the 6.6-inch display we're expecting with the first Air model coming later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple's Eddy Cue: AI Could Replace iPhone in 10 Years</h2>\r<br />\nAs part of his testimony in the ongoing Google antitrust trial, Apple's Eddy Cue acknowledged that AI is advancing so rapidly that it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/07/eddy-cue-ai-replace-iphone-10-years/\">could lead to the iPhone becoming obsolete within ten years</a>. With AI making its way into wearables and other devices, we'll be able to do more and more without the need for a traditional smartphone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iphone-16-pro-ghost-hand.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1785\" height=\"1004\" />\r<br />\nCue also said that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/07/apple-working-on-ai-search-in-safari/\">Apple is looking at adding AI-powered search services to Safari</a>, noting that searches in Safari dropped for the first time ever last month as consumers embrace AI-powered alternatives. Google has, however, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/08/google-disputes-safari-search-traffic-decline/\">seemingly contradicted that claim</a>, asserting that it continues to see an increase in total queries coming from Apple devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/may-8-2025\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/10/top-stories-ios-18-5-release-imminent-iphone-rumors-for-2025-and-beyond-and-more/\">Top Stories: iOS 18.5 Release Imminent, iPhone Rumors for 2025 and Beyond, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-ios-18-5-release-imminent-iphone-rumors-for-2025-and-beyond-and-more.2456826/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e9a8a9cdeede60cca4e3d9f1cecf133075034e30354f2b7179715af2e744c168","category":"Apple"}
