However, the news outlet claims that mass production of the headset isn't expected to begin until September due to manufacturing delays. Apple is said to be \"anticipating some production issues\" with the headset, but there are no specific details.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe headset is expected to have an internal screen for virtual reality, while outward-facing cameras would allow users to view the real world inside the headset with augmented reality overlays. This combination is known as \"mixed reality.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther details corroborated by the report include the headset being \"experimental\" and \"unconventional\" relative to most other Apple products, costing around $3,000, and having a waist-mounted external battery pack. FaceTime, Apple Fitness+, and gaming could be three major use cases for the headset, the report adds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile it remains to be seen what the headset's biggest selling point will be, its capabilities \"far exceed those of competitors,\" according to some sources cited in the report. Apple's headset is said to offer \"greater levels of performance and immersion\" than some competing devices, like Facebook parent company Meta's Quest Pro headset.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWWDC begins with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/29/apple-announces-wwdc-2023/\">Apple's keynote on June 5</a>, meaning that Apple's headset is likely just weeks away from finally being unveiled to the public.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/\">AR/VR Headset</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-wall-street-journal/\">The Wall Street Journal</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-glasses-ar-and-vr.209\">Apple Glasses, AR and VR</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/13/apple-headset-wsj-report/\">Apple Headset's Capabilities Said to 'Far Exceed' Those of Rival Devices</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-headsets-capabilities-said-to-far-exceed-those-of-rival-devices.2389472/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dcea6460505541ff5b175deacd7e833caf4b84d3f5aafc327e1da3aa7eb29591","category":"Apple"}
