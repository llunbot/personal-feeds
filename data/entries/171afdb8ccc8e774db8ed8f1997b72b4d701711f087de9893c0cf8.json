I Hate Him Passionately.’","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/07/3-early-takeaways-new-dominion-fox-lawsuit-documents/","date":1678313130000,"content":"\n<p>Aaron Blake, reporting for The Washington Post:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tuesday brought yet more documents in Dominion Voting Systems’\nhigh-stakes lawsuit against Fox News over Fox’s handling of claims\nthat Dominion’s voting machines helped rig the 2020 election.</p>\n\n<p>The documents come after Dominion recently detailed how Fox\nexecutives and hosts privately derided the stolen-election claims\neven as the network chose to air them anyway — often credulously — in the name of appealing to its Trump-supporting viewers. [...]</p>\n\n<p>While Fox’s hosts and executives clearly worried about alienating\nDonald Trump, it’s become abundantly clear that it wasn’t so much\nabout personal affection as a cold business decision. Repeatedly\nin the exhibits and depositions, they are shown deriding Trump. In\na Nov. 19, 2020, email, Rupert Murdoch appears to describe Trump\nand Rudy Giuliani as “both increasingly mad.”</p>\n\n<p>He adds of Trump: “The real danger is what he might do as\npresident. Apparently not sleeping and bouncing off walls! Don’t\nknow about Melania, but kids no help.” In his deposition, Murdoch\nnot only disputed Trump’s claim that the 2020 election was stolen,\nbut he also agreed when asked whether Trump was a “sore loser.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Dominion’s lawsuit is the gift that keeps on giving. The quote in my headline for this post? That’s from a message sent by Tucker Carlson, and that’s what he really thinks of Trump.</p>\n\n<p>As for Trump’s own team spirit:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In a Dec. 22 email, Lachlan Murdoch relayed [former New York\nPost editor in chief Col] Allan’s summary of a conversation\nwith Trump.</p>\n\n<p>“Col says POTUS was dismissive of Georgia race when he saw him on\nFriday,” Lachlan Murdoch said. “He basically said Republicans\nshouldn’t vote because it’s all rigged anyway. And if he can’t win\nno one should.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, I agree with Donald Trump about something.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/08/carlson-on-trump\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"5dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"171afdb8ccc8e774db8ed8f1997b72b4d701711f087de9893c0cf8","category":"Tech"}
