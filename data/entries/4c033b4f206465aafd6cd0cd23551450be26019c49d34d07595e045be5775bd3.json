Populations migrated, intermingled, and fragmented wherever they went, leaving us with a tangled genetic legacy that we often struggle to understand. The environment—in the form of disease, diet, and technology—also played a critical role in shaping populations.</p>\n<p>But this understanding is frequently at odds with the popular understanding, which often views genetics as a determinative factor and, far too often, interprets <em>genetics</em> in terms of <em>race</em>. Worse still, even though race cannot be defined or quantified scientifically, popular thinking creeps back into scientific thought, shaping the sort of research we do and how we interpret the results.</p>\n<p>Those are some of the <a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2023/03/researchers-need-to-rethink-and-justify-how-and-why-race-ethnicity-and-ancestry-labels-are-used-in-genetics-and-genomics-research-says-new-report\">conclusions of a new report</a> produced by the National Academies of Science. Done at the request of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the report calls for scientists and the agencies that fund them to stop thinking of genetics in terms of race, and instead to focus on things that can be determined scientifically.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924448#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924448&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4c033b4f206465aafd6cd0cd23551450be26019c49d34d07595e045be5775bd3","category":"Tech"}
