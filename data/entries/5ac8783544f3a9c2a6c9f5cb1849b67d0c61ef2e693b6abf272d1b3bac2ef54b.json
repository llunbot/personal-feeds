ULA could not submit its new Vulcan rocket, which will replace the Atlas V, for NASA to consider in future launch contracts until the Vulcan completed at least one successful flight, according to Tim Dunn, senior launch director at NASA's Launch Services Program.</p>\n<p>The Vulcan rocket's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/01/ulas-vulcan-rocket-shot-for-the-moon-on-debut-launch-and-hit-a-bullseye/\">first certification flight on January 8</a>, called Cert-1, was nearly flawless, demonstrating the launcher's methane-fueled BE-4 engines built by Blue Origin and an uprated twin-engine Centaur upper stage. A second test flight, known as Cert-2, is scheduled to lift off no earlier than October 4 from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. Assuming the upcoming launch is as successful as the first one, the US Space Force aims to launch its first mission on a Vulcan rocket by the end of the year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051934#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051934&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5ac8783544f3a9c2a6c9f5cb1849b67d0c61ef2e693b6abf272d1b3bac2ef54b","category":"Tech"}
