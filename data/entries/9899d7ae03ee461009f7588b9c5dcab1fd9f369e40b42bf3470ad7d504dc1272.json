{"title":"‘The Yankees Cap Goes Viral in Brazil: “Is It Basketball?”’","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/29/world/americas/yankees-caps-brazil.html","date":1680233305000,"content":"\n<p>Jack Nicas, reporting for The New York Times from Brazil on the nation’s most popular headgear:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>More than any other sports paraphernalia, the Yankees cap has\nbecome its very own fashion trend, unmoored from the sport or the\nteam it represents. Lifted by starring roles in hip-hop videos,\ncelebrity endorsements and collaborations with Gucci and Supreme,\nthe hat has gone fully global, crossing borders to lands where\nmentions of Babe Ruth and Aaron Judge will elicit blank stares — never mind trying to explain the “Evil Empire.”</p>\n\n<p>This week, the Yankees start playing meaningful baseball once\nagain, and Yankees fans in New York will pull on the caps to show\ntheir allegiance. But to many others in places like Brazil, China\nand Nigeria, the interlocked NY insignia will remain simply a\nclassic piece of Americana, a status symbol, or a generic — perhaps chic — emblem of the West.</p>\n\n<p>“The logo is super stylish and, I think, sophisticated,” said\nNatalia Monsores, 40, while checking out a wall of Yankees hats in\na luxury-mall shop owned by New Era, the Buffalo, N.Y., company\nthat makes the official Yankees caps. “It’s the symbol of the\nbrand, right? New Era,” she replied when asked what the logo\nmeant. “You’re sending a sign: ‘I’m wearing something quality.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Super stylish and something quality, indeed.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“It’s American football? Or is it a brand?” said Carlos Henrique,\n20, hawking Yankees caps off a metal rack he was carrying on Rio’s\nIpanema Beach. Either way, it was his best seller. “I just know it\ncalls attention,” he said. “And it looks good on everyone.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Someday soon, one can hope, it will look good on Shohei Ohtani and Mike Trout.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/30/yankees-caps-brazil\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9899d7ae03ee461009f7588b9c5dcab1fd9f369e40b42bf3470ad7d504dc1272","category":"Tech"}
