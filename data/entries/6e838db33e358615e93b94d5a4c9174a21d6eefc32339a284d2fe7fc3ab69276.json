That's according to <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.10.21264827v1\">preliminary data posted online</a> Wednesday from a clinical trial run by the National Institutes of Health.</p>\n<p>The trial bolsters what some have long hoped: that mixing and matching vaccines could provide stronger, broader protection against the pandemic virus and all its variants.</p>\n<p>The trial was not large enough to definitively indicate which combination of vaccines offers the best protection. And the early results, available on a preprint server, have not yet been peer-reviewed. But the preliminary trial findings do hint that Moderna's mRNA vaccine may offer the strongest protection all around—backing up similar findings from <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7038e1.htm?s_cid=mm7038e1_w\">earlier</a> vaccine-effectiveness <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2106599\">studies</a>. The data also suggests that people who received the one-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine may want to get a boost with one of the two mRNA vaccines, either Moderna's or Pfizer/BioNTech's.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804013#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804013&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6e838db33e358615e93b94d5a4c9174a21d6eefc32339a284d2fe7fc3ab69276","category":"Tech"}
