It's a feature aimed at journalists, activists, business leaders, and others who feel vulnerable to targeted security breaches. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen it launched in 2017, Google required users to have two physical security keys to activate it, and one of those keys plus a password to log in. Last year, the company changed the feature so that users could sign in with just a passkey, but the physical security keys were still required to set it up. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nFrom today, that's no longer the case. When users get started with <a href=\"https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/\">Google's Advanced Protection Program</a>, they will have the option to set up with either a passkey or a physical security key. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nPasskeys are easier to use and more secure than passwords because they let users sign in to apps and sites the same way they unlock their devices: With Face ID, Touch ID, or a device passcode. Passkeys are also resistant to online attacks like phishing, making them more secure than things like SMS one-time codes.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/google-advanced-protection-program-passkeys/\">Google Advanced Protection Program Adds Single Passkey Set-Up Option</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-advanced-protection-program-adds-single-passkey-set-up-option.2431042/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"18e2167560035c81cdadcccf7a19e5d18c7ae69b3babd868238899502233b7e7","category":"Apple"}
