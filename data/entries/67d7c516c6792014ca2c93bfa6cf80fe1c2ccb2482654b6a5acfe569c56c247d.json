Between 1961 and 2019, this workhorse pad accommodated a remarkable 520 launches, more than any other site in the world.</p>\n<p>Most recently, during the last two decades, the Soyuz-FG rocket launched cargo and crew missions from Gagarin's Start, which is located on the Kazakhstan steppe near the small city of Baikonur. The final launch from the site took place in September 2019, with the Soyuz MS-15 mission carrying Russian cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka, NASA astronaut Jessica Meir, and United Arab Emirates astronaut Hazza Al Mansouri to the International Space Station.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976209#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976209&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"67d7c516c6792014ca2c93bfa6cf80fe1c2ccb2482654b6a5acfe569c56c247d","category":"Tech"}
