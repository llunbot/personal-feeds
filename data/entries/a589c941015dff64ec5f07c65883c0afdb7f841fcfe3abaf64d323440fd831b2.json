The cable routing, limit screw location and main pivot on the B-knuckle are all virtually identical too.</p>\n<p>At a glance, only the moderately different shapes of the parallelogram plates and lighter colours differentiate the two.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Deore T8000 rear derailleur it replaces, the Cues U8000 rear derailleur also features a clutch.</p>\n<h2>Business as usual for cranksets</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The crankset is based on familiar Shimano tech.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Cues U8000 crankset is available in either 40 or 42t 1x options, or in a 46/32t double setup. Both options are available with or without a matching chainguard.</p>\n<p>Unlike some other Cues cranksets, the U8000 cranksets use a standard 24mm HollowTech II axle.</p>\n<p>The cranksets also use Shimano’s long-standing HollowTech construction.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The chainrings are fixed from the back of the spider.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>This sees two forged shells bonded together to create a lightweight and stiff crankset. The same technique is used on virtually all of its premium road, gravel and mountain bike groupsets.</p>\n<p>U6000 and U4000 cranksets use a new two-piece design (that’s similar to a SRAM DUB crankset) or good ol’ square taper.</p>\n<p>On cheaper Cues cranksets, the chainrings are riveted in place but, for Cues U8000 and U6000, they’re replaceable via bolts that thread directly into the spider of the crankset.</p>\n<p>Both the 1x and 2x U8000 cranksets use Shimano’s standard 110mm PCD asymmetrical chainring bolt pattern.</p>\n<h2>Shifters for anyone</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> So many shifters…</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>There are more Cues shifter options than would be reasonable to outline here.</p>\n<p>However, in brief, there are options for either clamp-on or I-Spec shifters across every groupset tier.</p>\n<p>If you don’t know an I-Spec from a Matchmaker (who can blame you?), check out our full guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/shimano-i-spec-a-b-and-ii-mounts-explained/\">Shimano I-Spec standards</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>Pictured is the Shimano Cues SL-U8000-11IR shifter. We expect this will be specced commonly on 11-speed Cues bikes that use Shimano brakes.</p>\n<h2>What about Cues U6000 and U4000?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> U6000 is expected to be specced widely on entry-level mountain bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Shimano</i></span></div>\n<p>Speaking to BikeRadar ahead of the launch of Cues, a Shimano USA spokesperson suggested U8000 will be seen mostly on electric trekking and touring bikes.</p>\n<p>While it was nice to fondle U8000, we’re most excited for Cues U6000.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, we expect bucket-loads of U6000-equipped entry-level mountain bikes, where it will go toe-to-toe with SRAM’s NX and SX groupsets.</p>\n<p>It’s unclear when we’ll see bikes equipped with either hit the market, but we promise to bring you a full overview as soon as we’ve got our hands on either.</p>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"a589c941015dff64ec5f07c65883c0afdb7f841fcfe3abaf64d323440fd831b2","category":"Cycling"}
