The camera will likely also support <strong>Desk View</strong>, which shows an overhead view of your desk.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCenter Stage is available in video calling apps like FaceTime and Zoom. The feature was previously limited to newer iPad models and Macs connected to Apple's external Studio Display. The new MacBook Pro and iMac models were the first Macs to support Center Stage without needing to rely on a Studio Display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new MacBook Air models will likely be equipped with <strong>three Thunderbolt 4 ports</strong>, whereas the current models have two Thunderbolt 3 ports. The new models will likely support <strong>up to two external displays</strong>, even when the lid is open. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Possible</h3>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe latest MacBook Pro and iMac models can be configured with a <strong>nano-texture display</strong>, which has a special coating that better scatters light to further minimize glare on the screen. It is possible that Apple will extend this option to the new MacBook Air models, unless it opts to keep the option exclusive to the MacBook Pro among its laptops.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Timing</h2>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast month, Apple released macOS Sequoia 15.2, and in doing so it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/macos-sequoia-15-2-m4-macbook-air-leak/\">accidentally confirmed new MacBook Air models</a> are coming this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman recently said the new MacBook Air models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/23/macbook-air-with-m4-chip-launch-timing/\">will be announced \"earlier\" than some other devices</a> rumored to launch this spring, such as a new iPhone SE. This likely means the new MacBook Air models will be announced in a press release on the Apple Newsroom website at some point from <strong>January through March</strong>, whereas the other devices might be announced at Apple's usual spring event in March or April. Apple would be getting the minor MacBook Air update out of the way early.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/02/what-to-expect-from-2025-macbook-air/\">New MacBook Air Models Coming Soon With These Rumored Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-macbook-air-models-coming-soon-with-these-rumored-features.2446573/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"654bc6dd00d47fb9692638eca71a714a404edd68b1ab634a5b99c3b932f6fba1","category":"Apple"}
