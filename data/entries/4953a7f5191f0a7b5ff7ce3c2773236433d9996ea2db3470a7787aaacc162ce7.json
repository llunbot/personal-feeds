The newest test of that promise will be Ubisoft's <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em>, which now has a release date and pricing information.</p>\n<p><em>Mirage</em> will land on compatible iPhones—the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max—on June 6, according to Ubisoft (though the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/assassins-creed-mirage/id6472704261\">App Store listing</a> says June 10.) That coincides pretty closely with Apple's annual developer conference, so we'd expect it to get a shoutout there. <a href=\"https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/6hRBheSWDoKUdnKxzy5YOg/assassins-creed-mirage-is-coming-to-ios\">Ubisoft's blog post</a> also says it will come to the iPad Air and iPad Pro models with an M1 chip or later.</p>\n<p>The game will be a free download with a 90-minute free trial. After that, you'll have to pay $50 to keep playing, which is pretty close to what the game costs on PC and consoles. It will support cross-progression, provided you sign into Ubisoft Connect. Ubisoft Connect is not exactly beloved by players, but it's nice to be able to take your saves back and forth between other platforms if you can stomach it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020857#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020857&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4953a7f5191f0a7b5ff7ce3c2773236433d9996ea2db3470a7787aaacc162ce7","category":"Tech"}
