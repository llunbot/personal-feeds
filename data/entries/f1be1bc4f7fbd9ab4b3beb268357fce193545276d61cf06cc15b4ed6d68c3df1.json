There is evidence that this vulnerability may be under limited, targeted exploitation. Users are recommended to upgrade if they are impacted by this issue.”</p>\n<p>The advisory continued: “A local non-privileged user can make improper GPU processing operations to access a limited amount outside of buffer bounds or to exploit a software race condition. If the system’s memory is carefully prepared by the user, then this in turn could give them access to already freed memory.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972619#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972619&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f1be1bc4f7fbd9ab4b3beb268357fce193545276d61cf06cc15b4ed6d68c3df1","category":"Tech"}
