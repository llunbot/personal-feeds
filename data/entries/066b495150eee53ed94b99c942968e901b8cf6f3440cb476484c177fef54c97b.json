That's a long way away, but still not so far away that it can't be leaked: the<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/the-pixel-8-pro-heralds-the-death-of-curved-screen-smartphones/\"> ever-reliable</a> Steve Hemmerstoffer, aka OnLeaks, has a set of Pixel 9 Pro renders up over at <a href=\"https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/pixel-9-pro-5k-renders-360-degree-video-exclusive/\">MySmartPrice</a>. Usually, these renders are based on the CAD files that accessory designers need before they can begin making products, so while all the major components should be correct down to the millimeter, the materials, colors, and some small details may be speculative.</p>\n<p>There are a <em>lot </em>of differences in these renders. First, the renders show a flat metal band around the sides, making it look a lot like an iPhone. Samsung <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/the-galaxy-s24-gets-seven-years-of-updates-1300-titanium-ultra-model/\">also adopted</a> this design for the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus, so everyone seems to want to look just like their biggest rival. This allows the front and back of the phone to be completely flat slabs of glass, instead of the rounded glass back of the Pixel 8. The screen is also completely flat again.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/10.jpg\"><img alt=\"Check out the new camera bar design. \" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/10-980x735.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/10.jpg\">Check out the new camera bar design. </a> (credit: <a href=\"https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/pixel-9-pro-5k-renders-360-degree-video-exclusive/\">OnLeaks and MySmartPrice</a>)</p></div>\n<p>The other major visible difference is the camera bar, which used to stretch from side to side across the back of the phone, but now is a floating bar that isn't connected to the sides. That makes the camera bar closer to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/07/pixel-fold-review-the-first-foldable-that-actually-feels-like-a-tablet/\">Pixel Fold design</a>. The Pixel Fold camera bar was a rounded rectangle, but this is a full-on pill shape, which, in these renders, follows the shape of the camera glass cover. Besides the camera lenses, the bar has an LED flash and a second mystery sensor circle. On the Pixel 8, the circle under the LED is a temperature sensor. I feel like the temperature sensor has been either <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/10/pixel-8-pro-review-the-best-android-phone/2/\">panned</a> or <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2023/11/12/pixel-8-pro-temperature-sensor/\">forgotten about</a>, so it wouldn't surprise me to see it cut, but the realities of the smartphone development cycle might make it too early for that.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998612#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998612&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"066b495150eee53ed94b99c942968e901b8cf6f3440cb476484c177fef54c97b","category":"Tech"}
