But they’re geared more towards long road &amp; gravel rides, rather than backcountry adventures. Calling them fast-packing bags, Silca’s canister-style Grinta Handlebar Bag and roll-top Grinta Saddle Bag are meant to just pack a few extra liters of gear for those longer, fast rides. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been riding with each in recent weeks. And appreciated the extra storage without having to overstuff my jersey <em>and</em> jacket pockets. Think: extra layers for rides in changing weather and extra snacks for long days away from easy refueling pitstops. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Silca Grinta light &amp; compact bikepacking bags for fast-packing</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Silca-Grinta-bags_lightweight-compact-fast-packing-bikepacking-packs-Reviewed-on-Basso-Venta-R-all-road-bike-ready-for-adventure.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Silca-Grinta-bags_lightweight-compact-fast-packing-bikepacking-packs-Reviewed-on-Basso-Venta-R-all-road-bike-ready-for-adventure-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"Silca Grinta bags, lightw &amp;

And hot debate. Plenty of roadies oppose even a conventional small saddlebag, thinking you should carry your gear in jersey pockets or a hollowed-out bidon in your 2nd bottle cage. To them I say, “ride on, and leave me be.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like on MTBs where I long ago ditched the CamelBak, on road and gravel bikes I want to ride without a load on my back. Saddlebags are generally the best solution. And more size options – with easy-to-use features – are always a net positive. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Riding Impressions Review</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Silca-Grinta-bags_lightweight-compact-fast-packing-bikepacking-packs-Review_saddle-bag-front-top-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Silca-Grinta-bags_lightweight-compact-fast-packing-bikepacking-packs-Review_saddle-bag-front-top-detail-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Silca Grinta bags, lightw &amp; compact fast-packing bikepacking packs Review, saddlebag attachment detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Silca-Grinta-bags_lightweight-compact-fast-packing-bikepacking-packs-Review_saddle-bag-front-top-detail-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Silca-Grinta-bags_lightweight-compact-fast-packing-bikepacking-packs-Review_saddle-bag-front-top-detail-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Silca-Grinta-bags_lightweight-compact-fast-packing-bikepacking-packs-Review_saddle-bag-front-top-detail-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Silca-Grinta-bags_lightweight-compact-fast-packing-bikepacking-packs-Review_saddle-bag-front-top-detail-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Silca-Grinta-bags_lightweight-compact-fast-packing-bikepacking-packs-Review_saddle-bag-front-top-detail-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Silca-Grinta-bags_lightweight-compact-fast-packing-bikepacking-packs-Review_saddle-bag-front-top-detail.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This Silca saddlebag is especially useful, as it packs down neatly with the roll closure and on/off pressure release valve.

Both with basic foam spacers to keep the bag just off the bar. The plastic buckles that close the straps are a bit fiddly. And it took me a minute to get used to them. But so far seem secure and kept the bag firmly in place over rough gravel shaking, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Silca-Grinta-bags_lightweight-compact-fast-packing-bikepacking-packs-Review_complete-all-road-setup-on-Basso-Venta-R.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Silca-Grinta-bags_lightweight-compact-fast-packing-bikepacking-packs-Review_complete-all-road-setup-on-Basso-Venta-R-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"Silca Grinta bags, lightw &amp; compact fast-packing bikepacking packs Review, alll-road bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Silca-Grinta-bags_lightweight-compact-fast-packing-bikepacking-packs-Review_complete-all-road-setup-on-Basso-Venta-R-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Silca-Grinta-bags_lightweight-compact-fast-packing-bikepacking-packs-Review_complete-all-road-setup-on-Basso-Venta-R-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Silca-Grinta-bags_lightweight-compact-fast-packing-bikepacking-packs-Review_complete-all-road-setup-on-Basso-Venta-R-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Silca-Grinta-bags_lightweight-compact-fast-packing-bikepacking-packs-Review_complete-all-road-setup-on-Basso-Venta-R-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Silca-Grinta-bags_lightweight-compact-fast-packing-bikepacking-packs-Review_complete-all-road-setup-on-Basso-Venta-R-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Silca-Grinta-bags_lightweight-compact-fast-packing-bikepacking-packs-Review_complete-all-road-setup-on-Basso-Venta-R.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined together, the pair are perfect for late winter rides when carrying an extra jacket plus arm &amp; leg warmers.
