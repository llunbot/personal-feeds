Those four other colors (for the aluminum case) are Midnight, Starlight, silver, and the charity-funding (Product) Red, so it would appear that Apple isn‚Äôt planning to drop any finishes to make way for pink.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Shrimp‚Äôs update<br />‚Äì Apple Watch Series 9<br />Well, i wish i can see anything that is new outside but it looks the same<br /><br />Added a pink color along with the other 4 colors with the same case material. <br />There is a new box this time (better than nothing) more compact box.<br />New chip i guess. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/rh95TNuady&amp;xcust=1-1-2016406-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/rh95TNuady</a></p>‚Äî ShrimpApplePro üç§ (@VNchocoTaco) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1686388125575327745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2016406-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">August 1, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>ShrimpApplePro also corroborated Bloomberg‚Äôs earlier prediction of a dark titanium (or in the leaker‚Äôs phrase, ‚Äúblack titanium‚Äù) Apple Watch Ultra 2 and, very briefly, forecast the imminent launch of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/ipad-mini-7-specs-design-processor-release.html\">iPad mini 7</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is well aware of the marketing power of a new color, which offers an instantly recognizable signal that a customer has the latest and greatest model in a range, and frequently tinkers with the available hues when it releases new Apple Watches. The Series 7 gained a new green aluminum option, while the Series 6 was the first to come in blue. Similarly (and for some, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1532375/yellow-iphone-color-launch-spring-holding-back.html\">more annoyingly</a>) the iPhone range often gains a new color as a sales boost midway through its refresh cycle, such as yellow in spring 2023 and purple in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For these reasons, it‚Äôs scarcely surprising that Apple would be planning new finishes for the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. But the choice of pink is surprising for two reasons. One: this won‚Äôt be the first time that Apple has offered a pinkish shade for the Apple Watch. Buyers of the first Apple Watch had the option of a rose gold Edition finish, and a rose gold aluminum finish was also an option for the Apple Watch Series 1 and 2. When Apple discontinued the rose gold option it was assumed it was due to poor sales due to its ‚Äòpinkness‚Äô.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two: pink is potentially a divisive color. Notoriously, some tech firms in the past have launched pink versions of their products aimed specifically and rather patronizingly at women; female editors on Macworld and its sister sites have on occasion been nonplussed to receive pink review samples without requesting that color. (I happen to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1371039/ipad-10th-generation-review.html\">love pink tech</a>, but being a male writer find that I generally have to specify this preference.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple, however, is generally quite good in its approach to diversity and gender politics, and is of course a master of the subtle marketing arts, so one would imagine that the pink Apple Watch Series 9, and the expected <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1997577/iphone-15-leaks-a-new-pink-color-super-skinny-bezels-and-stacked-batteries.html\">pink iPhone 15</a>, will be sold less clumsily than similar products have been in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches are both expected to launch in the next couple of months.
