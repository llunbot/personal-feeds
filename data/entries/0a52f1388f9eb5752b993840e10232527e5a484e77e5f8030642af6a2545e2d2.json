Following the departure of Derek Bouchard-Hall from the position, DeMartini was brought on at the start of 2019 after a lengthy stint as the CEO of New Balance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeMartini arrived in the role amid declining membership numbers at the organization and said in interviews at the start of his tenure that he would focus on effecting a turnaround in that department. Much of his subsequent time at the head of USA Cycling took place amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw widespread race cancellations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His time at USA Cycling saw the organization retool its youth development efforts, launching its Olympic Development Academy system. USA Cycling also created a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeMartini’s departure comes days after the US national cyclocross championships in Illinois, where the presence of a group of people <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/12/anti-trans-group-protests-at-us-cyclocross-nationals/\" target=\"_blank\">protesting</a> the participation of trans women in women’s sports led some attendees and activists to criticize USA Cycling. Some of those individuals signed a letter that called for DeMartini to resign, although there is no indication that DeMartini’s departure is related.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/12/usa-cycling-ceo-rob-demartini-is-leaving-the-role-for-a-job-outside-of-cycling/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"0a52f1388f9eb5752b993840e10232527e5a484e77e5f8030642af6a2545e2d2","category":"Cycling"}
