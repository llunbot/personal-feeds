All you have to do is create a Club, pick a sport, an icon, and your colors, then invite friends. Then, you can create a Group Ride or Group Workout event, and they’ll have templates to help you create cool events even if you’ve never done it before.</p><p>Or, skip the template and make up your own from scratch. Choose the time and date, pick a ride leader and sweeper, set the course, pace groups, and a few other parameters. The only caveat? You have to be a Level 20+ rider to create a club (or a Level 10+ runner), but anyone can join a club.</p><p>Down the road, they’ll add club workouts and a discovery feature to help you find new clubs to join.</p><h2>Interesting insights about Zwifters</h2><p>In the past 30 days, Zwift has captured some stats about when and how their members are using the platform. Here’s the recap:</p><ul><li>More people ride on Tuesday than any other day</li><li>Generally more use on weekdays, less on weekends</li><li>Mostly structured workouts during the weekdays, more “free” riding on weekend</li><li>Peak use on weekdays is from 3-9pm, mostly 6-9pm</li><li>But on weekends, it skews earlier</li><li>But early 5am Zwifters are more social and habitual</li><li>Group rides are 15-30% longer than solo rides</li><li>50% do a training ride, 20% compete in a race, and 80% explore</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20063121/zwift-duathlon-league-2022.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20063121/zwift-duathlon-league-2022.jpg\" alt=\"zwift duathlon league poster\" width=\"1326\" height=\"797\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20063121/zwift-duathlon-league-2022.jpg 1326w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20063121/zwift-duathlon-league-2022-297x179.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20063121/zwift-duathlon-league-2022-800x481.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20063121/zwift-duathlon-league-2022-120x72.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20063121/zwift-duathlon-league-2022-768x462.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1326px) 100vw, 1326px\"></a></p><p><strong>TRAINING:</strong><br>There’s currently just over 160,000 participants in Zwift Academy, which provides them with a lot of data.

It’s a work in progress.</p><p>For the ZRL (Zwift Racing League), they’re working on scheduled events that will help ensure people can reliably get into a race when they want to. They’re also growing their running side, and will be adding a Multisport league with a Duathlon event that has a 35 minute TT and 15 minute run, with a 10 minute transition between them.</p><p>For hopeful pros, there are new Continental Qualifiers coming later this month for athletes who’ve race enough to get an A+ ranking. They’ll qualify 25 men and 25 women for the championships event.</p><p>Lastly, Tour de Zwift is returning with an 8-stage The Giant Tour of Discovery on January 10, 2022.
