{"title":"Bearing Extraction: Using Blind Bearing Pullers","link":"https://www.hambini.com/bearing-extraction-using-blind-bearing-pullers/","date":1703433435000,"content":"Blind bearing pullers, initially created to remove bearings from rotating equipment without rear access, have been popularized for removing wheel bearings. Despite their increased use, these tools can inflict unnoticed damage on wheels. Primarily deployed in automotive and machinery maintenance, blind bearing pullers slide through the bearing, expand behind it, and retract, exerting a steady force without damaging surrounding areas. However, concerns arise when these tools are used without considering potential damage to internal preload spacers, causing potential legal repercussions for negligent installation in professional settings.","author":"admin","siteTitle":"Hambini Engineering","siteHash":"1914e5a1ff85f6709ba64c29f2993b45bb8ae4b7452977e0a1f13e2e79329648","entryHash":"e921af10db64f82b0cda28ba85b50754df05d422eaadb47ed0ff4415779e60a5","category":"Cycling"}
