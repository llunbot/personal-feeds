That's quite a lot of updates in one go, but if you think this means a further major refresh for the MacBook Pro is now several years away, think again.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/M6-MacBook-Pro-Feature-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1265\" />\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-03/apple-finally-finds-its-game-console-rival-with-the-new-m4-and-m4-pro-mac-minis-m31na57p\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> has said he expects only a small performance boost for the 2025 MacBook Pro models with the introduction of new M5 chips, while the \"true overhaul\" for the laptop will come in 2026. So if you are planning to skip this year's MacBook Pro, or you're just plain curious about what's two generations away, here are five big changes rumored to come to Apple's premium laptop line next year.\r<br />\n<br />\r<br />\n<span>OLED Display </span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Goodbye, mini-LED</span><br />\r<br />\nSeveral rumors have indicated that the first MacBook Pro models with OLED displays will be released in 2026. Research firm Omdia <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/oled-macbook-pro-could-launch-as-soon-as-2026/\">claims</a> Apple is \"highly likely\" to introduce new MacBook Pros featuring OLED displays next year, while display analyst Ross Young has said that Apple's supply chain is expected to have sufficient notebook-optimized OLED display production capacity in 2026 to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/10/macbook-pro-wont-switch-to-oled-in-2025-rumor/\">bring the technology to MacBook Pro</a>. Compared to current MacBook Pro models that use mini-LED screens, the benefits of OLED technology would include increased brightness, higher contrast ratio with deeper blacks, improved power efficiency for longer battery life, and more. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>Thinner, Lighter Laptop</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Major Redesign</span><br />\r<br />\nThe switch to OLED displays could allow future MacBook Pro models to have a thinner design, and rumors suggest that is indeed what Apple intends. When the M4 iPad Pro was unveiled in May 2024, Apple touted it as the company's thinnest product ever. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-plans-thinner-iphone-slimmer-macbook/\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> subsequently called the iPad Pro the \"beginning of a new class of Apple devices,\" and said Apple was working to make the MacBook Pro thinner over the \"next couple of years.\" Apple is reportedly focusing on delivering the thinnest possible device without compromising on battery life or major new features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNotably, the MacBook Pro got thicker and heavier with its most recent redesign in 2021. A major highlight was the reintroduction of several ports that were removed in previous iterations in favor of chassis thinness. How Apple will make its 2026 MacBook Pro thinner without removing the functionality it reintroduced fairly recently is the big question.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>Punch-Hole Camera</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>No More Notch</span><br />\r<br />\nIf you are fed up of the notch intruding on your Mac display, here's some good news. Apple plans to remove the notch from the MacBook Pro in 2026, according to a roadmap shared by research firm <a href=\"https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1864535769668571431\">Omdia</a>. The roadmap indicates that 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models released next year will have a hole-punch camera at the top of the display, rather than the notch we've become accustomed to. A MacBook Pro without a notch would offer additional visible pixels on the screen, creating a more uninterrupted and cohesive display design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>5G Modem</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Cellular Connectivity</span><br />\r<br />\nEarly in 2025, Apple plans to introduce the custom-built 5G chip that it's had in the works for years now. The modem chip will be added to the iPhone SE, low-cost iPad, and iPhone 17 \"Air,\" giving Apple an opportunity to test the technology before rolling it out to flagship devices. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, Apple will then consider <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apple-cellular-mac-custom-modem/\">bringing cellular connectivity to the Mac lineup</a> for the first time. The company is said to be \"investigating\" the possibility of adding a second-generation modem chip to a future Mac as soon as 2026, teasing the potential for a cellular MacBook Pro in the same year. The first Apple modem chip will be limited to sub-6GHz 5G speeds, but the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apples-second-5g-modem-said-to-support-mmwave/\">second-generation version</a> will support faster mmWave technology, according to Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>M6 Series Chip</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>2nm Process</span><br />\r<br />\nAssuming Apple follows a similar timeframe to its M4 chip rollout, Apple will update the MacBook Pro lineup in October this year with M5 series chips. The chips will be manufactured with TSMC's third-generation 3nm process, known as N3P, resulting in typical year-over-year performance and power efficiency improvements compared to the M4 series of chips. M6 chips, on the other hand, could adopt a completely new packaging process for Apple's 2026 MacBook Pro models. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to one <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/iphone-18-enhanced-2nm-chip-12gb-ram/\">rumor</a>, Apple's A20 chip in next year's iPhone 18 models will switch from the previous InFo (Integrated Fan-Out) packaging to WMCM (Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module) packaging. WMCM integrates multiple chips within the same package, allowing for the development of more complex chipsets. Components such as the CPU, GPUs, DRAM, and Neural Engine would therefore be more tightly integrated. While we don't know for sure, this could see Apple develop the M6 using the 2nm process while taking advantage of WMCM packaging to make even more powerful versions of its custom processor.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/08/5-reasons-to-wait-for-next-years-macbook-pro/\">5 Reasons to Wait for Next Year's MacBook Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/5-reasons-to-wait-for-next-years-macbook-pro.2446971/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"310141b56b1a1bb874b8c568a75eef7850334b26b27b30a7fe500272c4fce776","category":"Apple"}
