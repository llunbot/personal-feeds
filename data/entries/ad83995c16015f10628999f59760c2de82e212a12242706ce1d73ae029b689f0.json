The Italian brand is a go-to for cyclocross and silky smooth road tires. But for those who love the Getaway’s performance but don’t want to shell out for the high-end Pro version, the Challenge Getaway Race TLR could be your sweet spot. It has the same race-inspired tread design but comes at a lower price with a more durable vulcanized casing. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-side--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-side--1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Getaway Race 40mm side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-side--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-side--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-side--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-side--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-side--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-side--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-Challenge-Getaway-gravel-tire_all-new-fast-rolling-40mm-handmade-tubeless-gravel-bike-tires_made-in-Thailand.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-Challenge-Getaway-gravel-tire_all-new-fast-rolling-40mm-handmade-tubeless-gravel-bike-tires_made-in-Thailand-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Challenge Getaway gravel tire, all-new fast-rolling 40mm handmade tubeless gravel bike tires, sidewall\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-Challenge-Getaway-gravel-tire_all-new-fast-rolling-40mm-handmade-tubeless-gravel-bike-tires_made-in-Thailand-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-Challenge-Getaway-gravel-tire_all-new-fast-rolling-40mm-handmade-tubeless-gravel-bike-tires_made-in-Thailand-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-Challenge-Getaway-gravel-tire_all-new-fast-rolling-40mm-handmade-tubeless-gravel-bike-tires_made-in-Thailand-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-Challenge-Getaway-gravel-tire_all-new-fast-rolling-40mm-handmade-tubeless-gravel-bike-tires_made-in-Thailand-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-Challenge-Getaway-gravel-tire_all-new-fast-rolling-40mm-handmade-tubeless-gravel-bike-tires_made-in-Thailand-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-Challenge-Getaway-gravel-tire_all-new-fast-rolling-40mm-handmade-tubeless-gravel-bike-tires_made-in-Thailand.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>How Does It Compare to the Getaway Pro?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the most basic terms, the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/exclusive-new-tubeless-challenge-getaway-gravel-tires-get-supple-handmade-ride-quality/\">Getaway PRO TLR </a>is a more supple (260 TPI) tire that is lighter and handmade. It is similar to the cyclocross casing and rides with a little “spring.” It rolls fast and soaks up the bumps and lumps of the gravel with little reverberation hitting the body. This is unlike the Challenge Getaway XP, which is extra beefed up for protection in the most demanding conditions. (Read our review here.<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/all-new-challenge-getaway-xp-gravel-tire/\">)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Getaway Race TLR offers a similar ride feel but a more muted ride. Think of switching from a cotton tubular to a nylon tubless tire. It’s a different ride sensation, but the speed and efficiency remain. The Race tire is 60TPI and has a vulcanized construction. The casing feels similar to the PRO but acts slightly differently on the road and with sealant. I find that most Challenge cotton tires soak up the sealant for the first couple of rides, and need an extra inflation until a “total seal” is created. The tires don’t go flat, but they do lose pressure. The Getaway Race, however, held consistent pressure after the first inflation.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What About Weight? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our review Getaway Race TLR weighs 505g for a 700x40mm tire, compared to the Pro version’s 460g for the same size. That extra weight comes from a 60 TPI vulcanized nylon casing instead of the 260 TPI handmade polycotton on the Pro. While the Pro’s cotton-like ride feel is hard to beat, the Race version still brings impressive suppleness and speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-tread--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-tread--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Getaway Race 40mm tread\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-tread--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-tread--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-tread--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-tread--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-tread--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-tread--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-tread--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The price is another key difference, making this tire much more attractive to the gravel crowd. The Getaway Race TLR retails for $60, while the Getaway Pro costs $90. That’s more than a 30% savings, making the Race a solid option for riders who want performance without breaking the bank. As we all know, gravel race entry fees are not getting cheaper. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-knobs--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-knobs--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Getaway Race 40mm knobs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-knobs--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-knobs--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-knobs--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-knobs--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-knobs--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-knobs--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-knobs--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>A Different Build, But Still Fast</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the handmade Getaway, which has a glued-on tread cap, the Race model uses a VTR (Vulcanized Tubeless Ready) construction. This method molds the tread and casing together under heat and pressure, creating a tougher, more integrated structure. While this usually results in a stiffer feel, Challenge has found a way to keep the ride impressively smooth.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-side-knob-closeup--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-side-knob-closeup--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Getaway Race 40mm side knob closeup\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-side-knob-closeup--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-side-knob-closeup--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-side-knob-closeup--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-side-knob-closeup--120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-side-knob-closeup--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-side-knob-closeup--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-side-knob-closeup--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tread design stays true to the Getaway DNA, with a tightly packed center section and shallow side knobs. The knobs are under 2 mm tall, so they keep rolling resistance low while still offering solid grip on hardpack and loose-over-hard conditions. Don’t look for any ground-breaking wet weather performance – this is a dry to slightly damp tread. The Gravine is a much better (but slower rolling) option if you’re looking for a wet-weather tire.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-top-down--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-top-down--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Getaway Race 40mm top down\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-top-down--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-top-down--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-top-down--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-top-down--120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-top-down--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-top-down--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-top-down--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Challenge Getaway Race TLR Details</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Casing:</strong> 60 TPI Nylon Superlight</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Intended Terrain: </strong>Gravel and Hardpacked </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Weight: </strong>505g (40mm)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Color Option: </strong>Tan and Black side wall </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sizes: </strong>40mm (as of right now) </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> $60.00</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-full-bike--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-full-bike--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Getaway Race 40mm full bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-full-bike--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-full-bike--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-full-bike--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-full-bike--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-full-bike--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-full-bike--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-full-bike--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ride Impressions – Challenge Getaway Race</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For a 60 TPI vulcanized tire, the Getaway Race feels surprisingly quick. Challenge’s rubber compound (which differs from the Pro version’s) significantly keeps things lively. It feels downright fast on smooth gravel, fire roads, and dry singletrack—one of the better rolling vulcanized gravel tires I’ve ridden.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What About That Challenging Setup? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the earlier cyclocross HTLR tires were rough to set up, which led to a bit of a stigma with Challenge TLR tires. They have gotten more manageable and much better to set up <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N9a1tqYky4\">(you have to use the Challenge process here)</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I mean, you don’t want to burp a tire on a grassy off-camber, right? </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Getaway Race, on the other hand, is downright easy to set up. It’s the easiest Challenge TLR tire that I’ve set up. It mounted quickly and seated with just a floor pump. Inflated to 40 psi on a 25 mm internal width rim <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hunt-25-40-carbon-gravel-race-take-surprisingly-light-wide-wheels-off-tarmac/\">(on our Hunt CGR 25 wheels)</a>, and the actual inflated width measures 40mm on the dot.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-full-logo--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-full-logo--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Getaway Race 40mm full logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-full-logo--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-full-logo--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-full-logo--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-full-logo--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-full-logo--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-full-logo--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-full-logo--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Durability and Sizing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the Getaway Pro, the Race TLR is tougher and more puncture-resistant, making it a better option for sharp, rocky terrain. I didn’t have a flat on my testing the entire time; I could have gotten lucky, but I’m usually accident-prone, so I’d say the tire works well in that regard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d love to see more size options size-wise. Right now, Challenge only offers it in 700x40mm, which is excellent for smoother gravel but leaves those of us wanting 45mm or even 50 mm out of luck. I’d personally like a 42mm tire that fills both the fast-rolling lightweight and bump compliance buckets. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-op-tread-full--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-op-tread-full--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Getaway Race 40mm op tread full\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-op-tread-full--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-op-tread-full--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-op-tread-full--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-op-tread-full--120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-op-tread-full--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-op-tread-full--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Challenge-Getaway-Race-40mm-op-tread-full--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking for a fast, tubeless-ready gravel tire that won’t cost as much as the high-end Pro version, the Challenge Getaway Race TLR is an excellent pick. It’s got the speed and grip of a premium tire with added durability and a much more accessible price point. While it’s not the most supple option out there, it punches well above its weight in performance, style, and durabilty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://us.challengetires.com/products/getaway-tlr\">Challenge.com </a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-challenge-getaway-race-tlr/\">Challenge Getaway Race TLR: Less Money with Comparable Performance</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ad83995c16015f10628999f59760c2de82e212a12242706ce1d73ae029b689f0","category":"Cycling"}
