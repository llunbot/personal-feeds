{"title":"Apple Surveys 12-Inch MacBook Users for Opinions on Size, Features, and More","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/09/apple-surveys-customers-on-12-inch-macbook/","date":1628519738000,"content":"Apple is sending surveys to select owners of the now-discontinued 2015 12-inch MacBook, asking them about their opinion on the laptop's size, feature set, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/retina_macbook_air_2015_design-16x9.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple announced the 12-inch MacBook in 2015 as a super-light and thin laptop aimed at customers needing an ultra-portable notebook. The 12-inch MacBook featured a fanless design, an Intel processor and was the first Mac to feature the butterfly keyboard. The laptop started at $1299.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe 12-inch form factor was considerably popular, as customers enjoyed its thin and light design. Apple updated the MacBook in 2016 and 2017 but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/09/apple-discontinues-12-inch-macbook/\">discontinued it in 2019</a> following the launch of the redesigned <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> with Retina Display.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe survey sent out to select customers of the 12-inch MacBook was rather generic. It consisted of simple questions asking customers for their opinion on the laptop's size, features, and what they would change about it.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple periodically sends out surveys to customers, and just <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/03/apple-surveys-ipad-mini-users-ahead-of-redesign/\">last week sent out surveys to current customers of the iPad mini</a>. Given the 12-inch MacBook has been discontinued, it's hard to assume Apple will reintroduce it into its lineup.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough, given the survey, Apple may be beginning to realize the market that exists for ultra-thin and portable laptops and could be contemplating working on a Mac notebook tailored for that market demographic. Alternatively, Apple may feel there's no need for a 12-inch MacBook given its current 11-inch and 12.9-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> offerings with an added Magic Keyboard accessory.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/31/12-inch-macbook-apple-silicon-this-year/\">report last year</a> suggested that an updated 12-inch MacBook would be one of the first Mac laptops to be announced featuring an Apple silicon chip. That did not come true, and Apple instead updated its 13-inch ‌MacBook Air‌ and MacBook Pro.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(Thanks, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zollotech\">Zollotech</a>)</em><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/09/apple-surveys-customers-on-12-inch-macbook/\">Apple Surveys 12-Inch MacBook Users for Opinions on Size, Features, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-surveys-12-inch-macbook-users-for-opinions-on-size-features-and-more.2306987/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9JDRc3oxYs0:fGOcjnk2wwc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9JDRc3oxYs0:fGOcjnk2wwc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/9JDRc3oxYs0\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0e4d4d70a10e6906605963525398451f5e01a979dc23173a131dca6e62fc06a3","category":"Apple"}
