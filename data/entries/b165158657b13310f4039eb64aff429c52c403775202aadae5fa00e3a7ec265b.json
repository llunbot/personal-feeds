In this article we're focusing on the best Cyber Monday discounts on Apple products like these and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/General-cyber-monday-20-sale-feature.jpg\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

Unfortunately, Amazon's and Walmart's $90 discount on the AirPods Pro with MagSafe hasn't returned today, but Amazon has a decent $70 discount for anyone who missed the Black Friday sale.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/airpods-pro-blue-holiday-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOtherwise, you'll find notable discounts on the AirPods 2 and AirPods 3, all available on Amazon this year. <strong>Some sales do require an automatic coupon, and so you won't see the deal price until you reach the cart screen.</strong>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JQMJHXY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\">AirPods Pro with MagSafe</a> - $179.00, down from $249.00 ($70 off)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JQL3NWT%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\">AirPods 3</a> - $149.99, down from $179.00 ($29 off, lowest price)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\">AirPods 2</a> - $99.99, down from $129.00 ($29 off)</li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Apple Pencil 2</h2>\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/apple-pencil-blue-holiday-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother leftover deal from Black Friday is on the Apple Pencil 2, which is <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07K1WWBJK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\">on sale for $99.00</a>, down from $129.00.
