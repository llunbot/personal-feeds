The device has no key hole as it is exclusively designed to be unlocked with a smartphone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/schlage-uwb-door-lock.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe Sense Pro Smart Deadbolt supports hands-free unlocking over NFC and it integrates Ultra Wideband (UWB) technology. The lock is able to unlock right when a user reaches their door by measuring distance, speed, and trajectory with UWB.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSchlage's lock will be one of the first to support hands-free unlocking using the Ultra Wideband chip in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>. Apple added an \"Express Mode\" hands-free unlocking feature to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, but it requires smart locks to have a UWB chip and there are no locks on the market with the functionality as of right now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe lock also supports tap to unlock over NFC and it includes a keypad for access with an entry code.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo go along with the Sense Pro Smart Deadbolt, Schlage is working on a new Schlage Home app that has a more user-friendly interface and allows for remote lock management.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSchlage has not provided pricing for the Sense Pro Smart Deadbolt, but it will be available for purchase later in 2025.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2025/\">CES 2025</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/06/schlage-smart-lock-uwb/\">New Schlage Smart Lock Supports Apple's iOS 18 Hands-Free Unlocking With UWB</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-schlage-smart-lock-supports-apples-ios-18-hands-free-unlocking-with-uwb.2446843/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9dab9882a35d552a716bdb3298c13e555198626b6a8d8b9e46e4eba8e5d09f04","category":"Apple"}
