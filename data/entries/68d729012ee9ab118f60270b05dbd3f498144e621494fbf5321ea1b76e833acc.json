{"title":"Amazon Pulls the Rug on ‘The Peripheral’ Season 2","link":"https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/the-peripheral-canceled-amazon-season-2-renewal-1235700019/","date":1692489629000,"content":"\n<p>Joe Otterson, reporting for Variety with the shittiest news of the day:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“<a href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-peripheral/\">The Peripheral</a>” has been canceled at Amazon’s Prime Video,\nVariety has learned. The news comes despite the fact that Amazon\n<a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/the-peripheral-renewed-season-2-amazon-1235518073/\">renewed the show for a second season</a> back in February. The\nseries, based on the William Gibson novel of the same name,\ndebuted on Amazon on Oct. 21, 2022.</p>\n\n<p>It starred Chloë Grace Moretz and hailed from executive producers\nLisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan under their rich overall deal with\nAmazon. According to an individual with knowledge of the\nsituation, the decision to not move forward with the second\nseason was heavily influenced by the ongoing writers and actors\nstrikes. In essence, even if the show was to go back into\nproduction soon, Season 2 would not be available until close to\nif not into 2025. [...]</p>\n\n<p>“The Peripheral” was the first series to debut under Nolan and\nJoy’s deal with Amazon, which is reportedly worth $150 million.\nThe duo are also prepping a series based on the video game\nfranchise “Fallout,” though that project does not yet have a\npremiere date. Production was reportedly finished on the series\nearlier this year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This sucks. <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/The-Peripheral-Season-1/dp/B0B8TFMYXZ\">The Peripheral</a></em> season 1 was really good: smart, entertaining, surprising, great characters and cast. It looked good too. Nolan and Joy were the team behind HBO’s <em>Westworld</em>, and <em>The Peripheral</em> was both stylistically and thematically similar — but just better. It’s like Nolan and Joy took another crack at the same thing. It’s so good I suggest watching it even knowing that there’s no future, and thus it ends very unsatisfyingly.</p>\n\n<p>I’m pissed that Netflix dropped <em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80214497\">1899</a></em> after just one season, but knowing that <em>1899</em> has no future, I’m a bit more reluctant to suggest watching it — it wasn’t nearly as good as <em>The Peripheral</em>. But we’re all <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/02/onion-netflix-wga\">used to this from Netflix</a>. Sad to see Amazon go that route.</p>\n\n<p>And I don’t get how the writer and actor strikes justifies this decision at all — <em>everything</em> is going to be delayed by these strikes. This just seems like Amazon <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-05/amazon-ceo-asks-his-hollywood-studio-to-explain-its-big-spending?srnd=technology-vp&amp;sref=aPhxMSeh\">getting cheap after they blew billions</a> on a shitty <em>Lord of the Rings</em> show and the big expensive letdown <em>Citadel</em>. A company that isn’t committed to an exceptional show like <em>The Peripheral</em> should get the fuck out of the business.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/amazon-peripheral-season-2\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"68d729012ee9ab118f60270b05dbd3f498144e621494fbf5321ea1b76e833acc","category":"Tech"}
