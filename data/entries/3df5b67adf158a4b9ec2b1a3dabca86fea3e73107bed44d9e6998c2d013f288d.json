The new Reverb AXS now features all-new air-over-air internals and now comes in a huge range of travel, from just 100mm for short, lightweight bikes to a whopping 250mm for the biggest long-travel bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That makes it the longest travel dropper on the market. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it does it, while lowering prices, too!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>RockShox Reverb AXS dropper post slips the script</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_flipped-around.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_flipped-around.webp\" alt=\"RockShox Reverb AXS dropper seatpost, more affordable air-only wireless dropper, flip th escrip[t\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_flipped-around.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_flipped-around-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_flipped-around-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_flipped-around-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_flipped-around-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the outside, it’s the swap from top to bottom for the AXS battery and controller that first caught our attention. But it’s in the spec sheet that we now see this post extends to an ultra-long 250mm travel in its longest configuration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reasoning behind it all started with boosting rear tire clearance when fully dropped, in order to provide longer travel to more riders. The bulky setup at the back of the head on the original Reverb AXS post meant riders on some of the smallest bikes could literally hit the AXS battery on their rear tire. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_battery-removed.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_battery-removed.webp\" alt=\"RockShox Reverb AXS dropper seatpost, more affordable air-only wireless dropper, battery removed\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_battery-removed.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_battery-removed-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_battery-removed-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_battery-removed-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_battery-removed-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_battery-removed-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_battery-removed-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, it gets tucked forward, just above your seatpost clamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the updates continue deep inside the post. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Air-over-air inside</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_side-dropped.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_side-dropped.webp\" alt=\"RockShox Reverb AXS dropper seatpost, more affordable air-only wireless dropper, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_side-dropped.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_side-dropped-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_side-dropped-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_side-dropped-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_side-dropped-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_side-dropped-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_side-dropped-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This new Reverb AXS features a completely new, ground-up redesigned set of now air-only internals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>RockShox describes the new ‘air-over-air’ ‘design as both more robust and easier to service. Plus, it even adds that little bit of ActiveRide compliance once you drop it slightly for better traction while climbing, just like RockShox teased with their gravel Reverb XPLR dropper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>At top out, the air-over-air design puts the rider atop a specially designed air spring chamber, with virtually no negative air spring. This delivers a firm and supportive platform for the rider. Once the valve is activated and the post moves into its travel, ActiveRide is engaged. ActiveRide introduces a negative air chamber that balances pressure with the positive chamber, enabling enhanced comfort and control during technical climbs.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_easy-service.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_easy-service.webp\" alt=\"RockShox Reverb AXS dropper seatpost, more affordable air-only wireless dropper, easier service\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_easy-service.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_easy-service-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_easy-service-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_easy-service-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_easy-service-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_easy-service-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_easy-service-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Image/SRAM)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From a servicing perspective, the new internals combine with the lower electronics controller &amp; battery to make disassembly quick, even without overly specialist tools. (<em>Although you will need a pump that can get up to 600psi for the 30.9/31.6 posts it seems.</em>) That means users can more readily take it all apart, or at least your local bike shop can do it, and actually give it the regular service that will keep it operating smoothly longer. Proper maintenance of droppers is often overlooked. But since they constantly get smashed with rear tire spray, it’s great to see RockShox making it easier to keep this new (and expensive) Reverb AXS dropper running smoothly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great side benefit of air-over-air and no oil inside is that you can now lift your bike by a dropped seat with no risk of harm to dropper function,</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_dropped-studio-detail.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1506\" height=\"1001\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_dropped-studio-detail.webp\" alt=\"RockShox Reverb AXS dropper seatpost, more affordable air-only wireless dropper, dropped detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_dropped-studio-detail.webp 1506w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_dropped-studio-detail-297x197.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_dropped-studio-detail-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_dropped-studio-detail-768x510.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_dropped-studio-detail-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-seatpost_more-affordable-air-only-wireless-dropper_dropped-studio-detail-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>complete AXS system compatibility</li>\n\n\n\n<li>controllable with most AXS shifters or controllers (not wireless blips)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>uses standard AXS battery</li>\n\n\n\n<li>30.9mm, 31.6mm &amp;
