Did we start with the wheel or the figures?</em></p>\n<p><strong>BC:</strong> The figures.</p>\n<p><em><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/WHEEL-F2-3_480x480.jpg?v=1635180703\" /></em></p>\n<p><em>And where did the Black Inc wheel idea come from?</em></p>\n<p>I read something about it, that it was <em>the</em> wheel, the most technologically advanced wheel at the moment, and if we are basing the issue around innovation, why not have the most innovative wheel available?</p>\n<p><em><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/WHEEL-F2-4_480x480.jpg?v=1635180789\" /></em></p>\n<p><em>Exactly. And it’s not even UCI-legal – it’s that hot. Who makes these wonderful little figures?</em></p>\n<p>Preiser, a German company.

I thought we should have them the real scale, but more of them. It was a balance of getting the right amount of people in there.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/WHEEL-F2_480x480.jpg?v=1635180935\" /></p>\n<p><em>It’s the bucket on a string that’s the killer for me.</em></p>\n<p>Do you see what it says?
