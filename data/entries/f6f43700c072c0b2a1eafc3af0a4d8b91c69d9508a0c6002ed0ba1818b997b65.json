So\nthe supplier got creative.</p>\n\n<p>It set up a front company in Southeast Asia to buy the machines.\nOnce the equipment reached the Southeast Asian country, it went to\na factory in India operated by Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that\nbuilds most of Apple’s iPhones in China, the people said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ian Malcolm: “Life finds a way.” So too with Apple getting what it wants.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>India is already assembling between 30 million and 40 million\niPhones a year — as much as one-fifth of the iPhone’s global\nproduction, according to people involved in Apple’s India supply\nchain. Apple is planning to increase iPhone production in India by\naround 10% this year, one of those people said. The company has a\nlong-term goal of moving about half of its iPhone production out\nof China, according to other people involved in Apple’s supply\nchain. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Increasingly, though, just getting that manufacturing equipment to\nIndia is a hassle. In many cases, Chinese authorities are delaying\nor blocking shipments of iPhone equipment to India without\nexplanation, according to multiple people involved in iPhone\nproduction.</p>\n\n<p>Foxconn has seen approval times from Chinese authorities for\nexporting iPhone-making equipment from its China factories to\nthose in India rise from two weeks to as long as four months, one\nof the people said. They are also rejecting some export\napplications without explanation, the person added.</p>\n\n<p>The equipment Chinese authorities are scrutinizing includes\nhigh-precision lasers that weld metal parts to the frames of\niPhones, air leak test stations that measure how waterproof the\ndevices are, and machines that can identify, grab and move parts\nfrom one location to another, known as pick-and-place machines,\naccording to three people involved in iPhone manufacturing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hardball tactics on all sides here.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/25/ma-india-china-iphone\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f6f43700c072c0b2a1eafc3af0a4d8b91c69d9508a0c6002ed0ba1818b997b65","category":"Tech"}
