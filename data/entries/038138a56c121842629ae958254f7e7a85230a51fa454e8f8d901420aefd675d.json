Final Cut Pro and\nLogic Pro for iPad bring all-new touch interfaces that allow\nusers to enhance their workflows with the immediacy and\nintuitiveness of Multi-Touch. Final Cut Pro for iPad introduces\na powerful set of tools for video creators to record, edit,\nfinish, and share, all from one portable device. Logic Pro for\niPad puts the power of professional music creation in the hands\nof the creator — no matter where they are — with a complete\ncollection of sophisticated tools for songwriting, beat making,\nrecording, editing, and mixing. Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for\niPad will be available on the App Store as subscriptions\nstarting Tuesday, May 23.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Both apps are priced the same: $5/month or $50/year, with a one-month free trial.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve all been waiting for these two apps to come to iPad, and at a glance, both of them look very good. Subscription pricing is interesting, and makes me wonder if the Mac apps are going to switch to that too. And a sidenote, releasing/announcing these apps now makes me think that next month’s WWDC keynote is chockablock with other announcements.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/09/final-cut-pro-logic-pro-ipad\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"038138a56c121842629ae958254f7e7a85230a51fa454e8f8d901420aefd675d","category":"Tech"}
