The feature will initially be limited to built-in Apple apps, but perhaps there will be an API that allows third-party apps to support it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe believe that the dark app icons paired with a dark wallpaper will give the Home Screen a full-blown Dark Mode appearance for the first time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman recently reported that iOS 18 will let users <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/ios-18-to-allow-users-to-recolor-app-icons/\">change the colors of app icons</a>, and this dark tint is related to that feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnother last-minute iOS 18 leak we recently reported about is the ability to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/08/ios-18-face-id-app-locking-rumor/\">lock individual apps behind Face ID</a> for the first time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will unveil iOS 18 during its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-apple-wwdc-2024-keynote-june-10/\">WWDC keynote on Monday</a>. The first iOS 18 beta will likely be made available to Apple Developer Program members immediately after the keynote, and the update should be widely released in September.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/09/ios-18-home-screen-dark-mode-rumor/\">iOS 18 Will Extend Dark Mode to Home Screen App Icons, Sources Say</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-will-extend-dark-mode-to-home-screen-app-icons-sources-say.2428499/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3fe2f2142d3127943fa91f4f4ac7e2c0c594a9a0e666cf4b4273fb520ff4f99d","category":"Apple"}
