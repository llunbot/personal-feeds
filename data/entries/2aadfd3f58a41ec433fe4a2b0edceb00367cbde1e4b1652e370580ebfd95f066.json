WiFi 6E adds minimal changes compared to WiFi 6 except for an added 6GHz band, which will result in increased bandwidth and less interference for devices that support Wi-Fi 6E.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>DigiTimes</em> says that as Apple plans to include the newer framework in this year's flagship model, it will slowly become the standard for iOS and Android devices next year, despite only being announced early last year.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Apple is set to incorporate Wi-Fi 6E technology into its new iPhones for this year, and the technology is expected to become a standard feature of both iOS and Android smartphones in 2022, the sources said.</blockquote>Today's report also further reiterates past reports that the LiDAR sensor, currently exclusive to the high-end Pro and Pro Max <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> models, will remain exclusive to those variants. Reports earlier in the year casted the possibility of LiDAR expanding to all models of the lineup; however, that's increasingly unlikely to be the case. \r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>As new iPhones will continue to adopt 3D face ID sensors for general models and ToF LiDAR scanners for Pro series, the three GaAS players will also see their third-quarter revenues further bolstered by VCSEL chips demand for the sensing solutions, the sources said.</blockquote>The ‌iPhone 13‌ is expected to be a minor upgrade compared to the ‌iPhone 12‌, with rumors of more advanced displays, improved cameras, and a smaller notch.
