It was also key in his failure to defend his title in 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Often it’s where the race really gets broken up, which means it’s nice to get off Mons-en-Pévèle and be at the front, as you know you’re really in the mix then.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So much so that Hayman points out that the first five riders off that section in 2016 – him, Tom Boonen, Ian Stannard, Sep Vanmarcke and Edvald Boasson Hagen – made up the top five at the finish in Roubaix.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-2023-highlights\">Grubers’ Paris-Roubaix gallery: Finding heaven in Hell</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-carrefour-de-l-arbre\">Where Paris-Roubaix 2024 will be decided, part 3: Carrefour de l’Arbre</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-velodrome\">Where Paris-Roubaix 2024 will be decided, part 4: Roubaix Velodrome</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-arenberg-forest\">Where Paris-Roubaix 2024 will be decided, part 1: The Arenberg Forest</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/02163711/insight_paris_roubaix_05-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"The dusty section of cobbles sits below a field of green grass and light blue sky, with yellowish trees in the distance.
